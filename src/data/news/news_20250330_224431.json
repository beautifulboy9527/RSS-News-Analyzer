The discovery is one of the most significant findings in the search for evidence of past life on Mars. This is because, on Earth at least, relatively complex, long-chain carbon molecules are involved in biology. These molecules could actually be fragments of fatty acids, which are found in, for example, the membranes surrounding biological cells.</p>\n<p>Scientists think that, if life ever emerged on Mars, it was probably microbial in nature. Because microbes are so small, it’s difficult to be definitive about any potential evidence for life found on Mars. Such evidence needs more powerful scientific instruments that are too large to be put on a rover.</p>\n<p>The organic molecules found by Curiosity consist of carbon atoms linked in long chains, with other elements bonded to them, like hydrogen and oxygen. They come from a 3.7-billion-year-old rock dubbed Cumberland, encountered by the rover at a presumed dried-up lakebed in Mars’s Gale Crater.

    "content": "\n              <p><em>ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=reprint&amp;placement=top-note\">The Big Story newsletter</a> to receive stories like this one in your inbox</em>.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.</p>\n<p>In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.</p>\n<p>A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”</p>\n<p>But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:</p>\n<p>“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us\">column Kennedy wrote</a> for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”</p>\n<p>ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.</p>\n<p>“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”</p>\n<p>For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html\">promoted them with confidence</a>. One campaign was called “<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm\">Get My Flu Shot</a>.” The agency’s website <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html\">told medical providers</a> they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”</p>\n<p>Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.</p>\n<p>Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.</p>\n<p>When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’s communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes—nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”</p>\n<p>“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”</p>\n<p>Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”</p>\n<p>The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.</p>\n<p>Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.</p>\n<p>In late February, for example, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html\">forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1</a> bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general US population, they said, was low.</p>\n<p>In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the US is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)</p>\n<p>The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”</p>\n<p>This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”</p>\n<p>The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”</p>\n<p>Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.</p>\n<p>During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated\">NPR reported</a> this.</p>\n<p>But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.</p>\n<p>On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated <a href=\"https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB\">child had died</a> of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/\">downplayed the seriousness</a> of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/\">only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, the CDC added <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html\">an entry on Vitamin A</a> to its measles website for clinicians.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, CNN reported that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html\">several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function</a>, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.</p>\n<p>Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/\">will hinder their ability to respond</a> to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.</p>\n<p>Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20 percent of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html\">nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children</a> with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html\">linger in the air</a> for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.</p>\n<p>This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/\">rode one of its trains</a> from New York City to Washington, DC.</p>\n</div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://pixel.propublica.org/pixel.js\" async></script></p>\n<p> </p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/the-cdc-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/the-cdc-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

By exploiting a model's inability to distinguish between, on the one hand, developer-defined prompts and, on the other, text in external content LLMs interact with, indirect prompt injections are remarkably effective at invoking harmful or otherwise unintended actions. Examples include divulging end users’ confidential contacts or emails and delivering falsified answers that have the potential to corrupt the integrity of important calculations.</p>\n<p>Despite the power of prompt injections, attackers face a fundamental challenge in using them: The inner workings of so-called closed-weights models such as GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini are closely held secrets.

Truthfully, most of the offers below aren’t explicitly tied to the Spring Sale, but they still drop a number of Apple (and Beats) gadgets we recommend down to lower prices than usual. As a reminder, Amazon says the sale will run through March 31 and that a few (but not all) of the discounts are exclusive to Prime members.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-amazon-spring-sale-apple-deals\">Best Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"cb596b3198974b01ab66ca1d8edeaa42\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1ecfdf52-d4a0-469b-ae6c-b3287c2abbe9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwREdKN0hZRzE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWVjZmRmNTItZDRhMC00NjliLWFlNmMtYjMyODdjMmFiYmU5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwREdKN0hZRzEiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX-vIlVnzoTMZEv5bH_Tkp7voDOr0sZJvayikDS_O-NZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ7HYG1\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1?th=1\"><strong>Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $149 ($30 off MSRP)</strong></a>: This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple’s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn’t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html\">score of 86</a> in our review.

But more recently, I got a chance to check out the entire lineup all in one place. It seemed like a perfect time to do a quick rundown of some of the most interesting new products and features coming to Samsung’s Bespoke portfolio later this year.</p>\n<p>The centerpiece of the Bespoke line remains <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-unveils-new-refrigerator-lineup-equipped-with-screens-and-enhanced-ai-vision-inside-feature\"><ins>Samsung’s 4-door French-Door refrigerator</ins></a>, which is now available with two different-sized screens. There’s a model with a smaller 9-inch screen that starts at $3,999 or one with a massive 32-inch panel called the Family Hub+ for $4,699. The former is ostensibly designed for people who want something a bit more discreet but still want access to Samsung’s smart features, which includes widgets for your calendar, music, weather, various cooking apps and more. Meanwhile, the larger model is for families who aren’t afraid of having a small TV in their face every time they open their fridge. You can even play videos from TikTok on it, if that’s what you’re into.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/5c2c7460-0b28-11f0-b7ff-8ec2911b2885\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/5c2c7460-0b28-11f0-b7ff-8ec2911b2885\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"Samsung&#39;s 4-Door Bespoke Fridge with 32-inch Family Hub+ display. \" data-uuid=\"7347091e-2f9a-33f9-b2f8-1229e9f41960\"><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s massive 32-inch Family Hub+ display supports a number of widgets for stuff like weather, music and even TikTok.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>That said, Samsung is hoping to entice people to take advantage of those displays with even more AI-powered tools, most notably its improved AI Vision Inside object recognition. By using sensors mounted within the appliance, Samsung says its latest Bespoke fridge can detect 37 different types of fresh ingredients (e.g. produce and dairy) and up to 50 processed foods. This allows the device to keep an up-to-date list of items you may (or may not) have on hand, which you can view on the fridge’s display or from your phone while you’re grocery shopping.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/c6b89bb0-0b28-11f0-bbee-2d8307e8c411\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/c6b89bb0-0b28-11f0-bbee-2d8307e8c411\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"The smaller 9-inch screen for Samsung&#39;s latest Bespoke fridges. \" data-uuid=\"1463e01e-a80b-37c6-a47e-2a2334db79ba\"><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s smaller 9-inch display blends in much better for anyone averse to big screens in their kitchen.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Now, I will fully admit that AI has become a somewhat empty buzzword recently, and in this situation, I’m not entirely sure what the difference between AI-based and traditional object recognition really is. But being able to have your fridge generate a list of what’s inside when you’re at the store is the kind of convenience I’d like to see more of. Other features on Samsung’s Bespoke French-Door fridges include built-in Wi-Fi and SmartThings connectivity, a Dual Auto Ice maker that can create both regular and smaller “Ice Bite” cubes and the always useful Beverage Center with its built-in cold water pitcher.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/8ced4b70-0b31-11f0-9faf-34a095cd5a10\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/8ced4b70-0b31-11f0-9faf-34a095cd5a10\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"Samsung&#39;s AI Vision Inside feature\" data-uuid=\"8197d0ae-8e99-3710-b9b4-d0e03c148243\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>If all this isn’t techy enough, Samsung also has a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-unveils-new-refrigerators-innovative-ai-hybrid-cooling-technology-ces-2025/\"><ins>Hybrid version</ins></a> of its 4-door fridge (starting at $3,999) that chills its contents using both a standard compressor and a solid-state <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling\"><ins>Peltier module</ins></a>. The idea is that in normal use, the compressor provides consistent baseline cooling while the Peltier module (through the power of AI) turns on to address big changes in temperature. For example, the module would kick on when you&#39;re loading groceries or simply have the doors open for too long. Not only does this help bring temperatures back to normal faster, it also reduces overall energy consumption. For people looking to cram a new fridge in a tight spot, Samsung also made the Bespoke 4-Door Flex Kitchen Fit Refrigerator (price is still TBD). While it doesn’t have a Peltier module, the advantage of this model is that it has different doors and hinges that don’t protrude nearly as much when open. This means the fridge only needs a gap of just 4mm (0.15 inches) on each side instead of multiple inches like a normal fridge.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/fb1c5880-0b30-11f0-becf-f93866570b16\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/fb1c5880-0b30-11f0-becf-f93866570b16\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"Samsung Bespoke Auto Open Door Dishwasher\" data-uuid=\"14dc9ccc-c53f-3d04-b27e-db03171221bd\"><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s Bespoke Auto Open Door Dishwasher has a dedicated pan holder and sprayers on its third-rack for glasses.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>For cooking, Samsung’s matte glass induction cooktops are mostly the same, but its Bespoke 30-inch single ($3,759) and double ($4,649) wall ovens have…you guessed it, more AI. In addition to a 7-inch display, there are also cameras and sensors inside the oven that can recognize up to 80 different recipes to provide optimal cooking times. But if you prefer to go off-script and create something original, Samsung says the oven will give you the option to save the recipe and temperature settings after cooking the same dish five times. And for a more fun application of its tech, the oven’s cameras can record videos and create time-lapses of your baked goods for sharing on social media.</p>\n<p>When it’s time to clean up, Samsung’s $1,399 Bespoke Auto Open Door Dishwasher has a few tricks of its own. In this case, the washer uses AI (yet again) and sensors to more accurately detect food residue and optimize cleaning cycles. There’s also a third rack with dedicated sprayers for glasses. But the best part is that while in use, the washer tops out at just 38 decibels, which Samsung says makes it one of the quietest models in its class.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/e06b6b30-0b2f-11f0-97ff-b8daded5e41a\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/e06b6b30-0b2f-11f0-97ff-b8daded5e41a\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"Samsung Bespoke All-In-One Washer Dryer Vented Combo\" data-uuid=\"7c0bb94f-5040-39d5-ba96-91aa6005d505\"><figcaption>Samsung claims its all-in-one vented combo can do a full wash and dry cycle in as little as 68 minutes.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Moving on to laundry, Samsung says its $3,099 Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo is the first of its kind, as most combined washer/dryers are typically meant for ventless installations like small apartments (of course, there is a non-vented model as well).

Players will be able to link their Uni devices to the game to access special perks — kind of like how the beloved, defunct TamaTown worked. <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em> comes out on June 27.</p>\n<p>In <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em>, players will act as shopkeepers and help get the town ready for the big Tamagotchi festival.

Of course, you don't need a Uni device to play; it has enough appeal on its own as a super cozy game that'll tug at franchise fans' nostalgia.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-new-tamagotchi-game-for-nintendo-switch-will-connect-with-tamagotchi-uni-160639100.html?src=rss",

    "content": "<p>Back in 2022, Sony <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-game-preservation-team-143059442-143059184.html\">hired Garrett Fredley</a> to join its then newly formed Preservation team, which has been working to find and save documentation of PlayStation&#39;s 30-year history since then. Now, Fredley spoke at Game Developers Conference to give an update about his team&#39;s efforts. In his <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.gamefile.news/\">Game File newsletter</a>, Stephen Totilo has shared the details about Fredley&#39;s talk. Apparently, the team formed what it&#39;s calling the PlayStation Studios Vault to store everything it could find about Sony&#39;s game-making history.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Vault now houses game builds, source code and source art, but it has all kinds of other files, as well. Fredley explained that it was created to preserve &quot;everything that is ever related to a project you can possibly find: from documentation to audio assets, to prototype information, anything under the sun, even cultural artifacts.&quot; If it&#39;s adjacent to a PlayStation studio game, the team will store it in the Vault — even photos of developer teams that made the game. Currently, the oldest item in the team&#39;s collection has a 1994 timestamp and was from the tactical RPG <em>Arc the Lad</em>. The latest files include every customer-facing PS5 build of every PlayStation Studios game, as well as every debug, testing, alpha, beta and milestone releases. It has over 1,000 builds saved.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>At the moment, the Vault has two main servers located in Las Vegas, Nevada and Liverpool, England, which store 650 terabytes of data, or around 200 million files. That&#39;s almost double the 350 terabytes of data Fredley said the team gathered during another one of his talks last year. He expects to quickly go over the 1 petabyte of cloud server storage data the team&#39;s current setup can handle, especially since more and more games are being developed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The preservation team uses tools to help its work, including a robot called Vaultron that can read thousands of discs to find files. But it still hasn&#39;t been easy, since most studios don&#39;t exactly store their files in a way that makes them understandable and accessible decades from now. Going forward, Fredley and his team will have to solve a few problems that they&#39;re expecting to pop up. They&#39;ll need to have good indexing tools, for instance, and figure out a way to maintain the ability to use the files they collect.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-has-been-backing-up-its-ps5-game-builds-as-part-of-a-preservation-effort-150025423.html?src=rss",

The company&#39;s entry-level tablet now has an A16 chip that offers plenty of power for most people. The iPad Air is still a better option if you can afford to spend more, according to buying advice senior reporter Jeff Dunn. &quot;But for $250 less than the latest Air, the iPad (A16) does well to meet most iPad users where they live,&quot; <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html\">he writes</a>. &quot;It’s not the most delightful iPad, but it’s good enough for the masses.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro\">Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"50f4b529d60b486998127aec85c6251e\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://us.nothing.tech/pages/phone-3a\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>The Nothing Phone 3a is much more than an update to the 2a when you consider the company opted to debut a new Pro model alongside it. There are concerns about a limited warranty in the US, but the 3a is a great budget device and the Pro has better-than-midrange cameras. &quot;It&#39;s really hard to criticize Nothing for any of the component choices, and if you&#39;re willing to take a risk on the company&#39;s limited US warranty and want something unique, these are the phones to buy,&quot; senior reporter <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html\">Igor Bonifacic explains</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-noble-audio-fokus-apollo\">Noble Audio FoKus Apollo</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"ee4ac75df8784545a6cc2e56bd5e55c7\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://nobleaudio.com/products/fokus-apollo\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>$649 is a lot to pay for a pair of wireless headphones. But if you&#39;re searching for the absolute best available sound quality, perhaps money is no object. Noble Audio&#39;s FoKus Apollo has a unique driver setup that offers a more expansive and detailed soundstage than the competition and long battery life, but that&#39;s about it. &quot;For me, to pay $649 I expect more in terms of features,&quot; <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html\">I argue</a>. &quot;The first item would be better ANC performance, but I don’t feel like spatial audio support and wear detection are too much to ask.&quot;</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-assassins-creed-shadows-and-a-cheap-tablet-battle\">Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows and a cheap tablet battle</h2> \n<p>Contributing reporter Kris Holt spent some time with the new Assassin&#39;s Creed title and came away with some mixed feelings on the game. &quot;<em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows</em> has impressive technical work, great performances and an expansive, well-drawn story but it&#39;s unfortunately weighed down by some frustrating decisions and antiquated gameplay systems,&quot; <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-review-an-ambitious-and-captivating-world-thats-stuck-in-the-past-170008367.html\">he writes</a>. &quot;Still, I&#39;m eager to keep exploring.&quot;</p> \n<p>In addition to reviewing the latest iPad, Jeff also pit the Amazon Fire HD 8 against Walmart Onn 8 in a battle of the sub-$100 tablets.

Unlike the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/solar-eclipse-2024-how-to-watch-and-record-the-total-eclipse-on-monday-163035394.html\">“Great American Eclipse” of 2024</a>, however, this will not be a total eclipse. Instead, this event will be a partial eclipse visible in parts of the northern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While this one will lack the dramatic \"totality\" of the 2024 event, a partial eclipse is still worth seeing. The sun will not be fully obscured, but with proper eye protection, you will be able to see the moon take a bite out of the sun. And there's a catch, but it's also an opportunity: This eclipse will occur at sunrise in North America, meaning the sun will just barely be above the horizon. But that timing offers viewers the chance to see the famed “devil horns” — a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://weather.com/science/space/news/2025-03-24-deep-partial-solar-eclipse-march-29\">crescent of solar light</a> emerging from behind the moon.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>When can you watch this partial solar eclipse, and those devil horns? Let’s talk about how to safely watch this eclipse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-areas-will-experience-the-partial-solar-eclipse-and-when\"><strong>What areas will experience the partial solar eclipse, and when?</strong></h2>\n<p>The partial solar eclipse will be visible in areas of the northern hemisphere. It will be visible at sunrise in eastern North America and sunset in Siberia, Russia on Saturday, March 29. In Europe, it can be viewed around mid-morning. But the event’s footprint will be limited: No eclipse will be visible west of Toronto, Canada, and Washington, DC in North America.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/ad23c430-0b10-11f0-96b6-02327a58f484\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/ad23c430-0b10-11f0-96b6-02327a58f484\" style=\"height:1024px;width:1024px;\" alt=\"This NASA map shows the extent of the moon's coverage of the sun during the March 29 eclipse.\" data-uuid=\"575ada27-91b1-31c0-a4b4-7f07eb8eab88\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div></figure>\n<p>This global map of the partial solar eclipse from NASA is more than a little confusing, but here’s how to read it. The yellow curve is the path of the partial solar eclipse, moving from west to east. The lighter colored yellow curves give the percent obscuration of the sun. (In other words, how much of the sun is covered by the moon depends on where you are and when you’re looking.)</p>\n<p>Most of Europe will only see around a 20 percent obscuration (with the exception of Greenland and Iceland), for example, while the extreme northeastern part of the United States will see up to 89 percent of the sun covered. The Nunavik region of Quebec will see maximum obscuration of 94 percent. The green lines on the map show the eclipse’s progress over time. Times are given in UTC, which is four hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time.</p>\n<p>However, sunrise and sunset makes things more complicated. This is depicted on the map by the orange loop. The left side of the loop (over the Great Lakes in the United States) shows where the eclipse <em>ends</em> at sunrise. Therefore, the eclipse is not visible west of that orange line. The right side of the loop is where the eclipse <em>begins</em> at sunrise.</p>\n<p>That means to see the maximum partial solar eclipse at sunrise, it’s best to be along that blue line running down the middle of the orange loop. (It’s worth noting that the eclipse will also be visible across a narrow part of Siberia, but at sunset rather than sunrise — that’s what the other half of the orange loop depicts).</p>\n<p>If it seems incredibly confusing, that’s because it is indeed incredibly confusing. Some places with maximum obscuration will have a shorter eclipse duration because the partial eclipse will start before sunrise. The sun will also be low to the horizon in North America, so any viewing location will need to be above tall trees with a clear view of sunrise. In Europe, the viewing locations will be easier because the sun will be higher in the sky — but the sun will not be as obscured.</p>\n<p>For example, in Bar Harbor, Maine, the sun will rise at 6:19AM, and the maximum eclipse will be at 6:22AM, with 80 percent of the sun obscured. The partial eclipse will end at 7:11 am. Technically though, the eclipse will begin at 5:26 am ET, but because that's before sunrise, Mainers will be cheated out of about half their potential eclipse viewing time.</p>\n<p>Moving south, the best view will be through coastal New England, then down through Boston, New York City and Philadelphia.The path basically ends in Washington, DC, where just 1.2 percent of the sun will be obscured at 6:59AM ET.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d245ba60-0b11-11f0-afb3-bac0a6f772d4\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d245ba60-0b11-11f0-afb3-bac0a6f772d4\" style=\"height:819px;width:856px;\" alt=\"Canadians will see the biggest bite taken out of the sun. \" data-uuid=\"2ae4ec29-780a-30ee-be59-c90c20eb4fb9\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div></figure>\n<p>According to<a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2025-march-29\"> Time and Date</a>, only 44,800 people will see a 90 percent partial eclipse, while 3,820,000 will see an 80 percent. That’s a far cry from the 30 million people in the path of totality for the 2024 total solar eclipse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-will-a-total-solar-eclipse-be-visible-in-the-middle-of-the-atlantic-ocean\"><strong>Will a total solar eclipse be visible in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean?</strong></h2>\n<p>No, there is nowhere on Earth that a total solar eclipse will be visible for this event. For any solar eclipse to happen, the sun, the moon and the Earth need to line up. However, because the moon doesn’t orbit in the same plane as the sun and the Earth, eclipses are rare.</p>\n<p>A partial solar eclipse, like the one occurring on March 29, occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, but it’s not perfectly lined up. As a result, the sun will have a crescent shape — as if the moon took a bite out of the sun — but it will never be fully obscured as it is during a total eclipse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-long-will-the-partial-eclipse-last\"><strong>How long will the partial eclipse last?</strong></h2>\n<p>The visible duration of the eclipse depends on where you are, and what time sunrise (or sunset) is at your location. But globally, the eclipse will begin at 4:50 am ET (8:50AM UTC). The maximum eclipse will occur at 6:47AM ET (10:47AM UTC), and the event will end at 8:43AM ET (12:43PM UTC). Keep in mind, though, that this doesn’t mean the entire partial eclipse will be almost four hours long in any given location because this is just for the extreme edges of the event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-weather-forecast-along-the-viewing-line\"><strong>What’s the weather forecast along the viewing line?</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s spring across the Northern Hemisphere, which generally means unfavorable weather for any sky viewing. The Weather Channel’s<a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://weather.com/science/space/news/2025-03-24-deep-partial-solar-eclipse-march-29\"> senior digital meteorologist Chris Dolce</a> said that cloud cover, and even rain and snow, may be likely in the northeastern United States during the eclipse, so it’s not great news there, unfortunately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-if-its-just-a-partial-eclipse-do-i-need-eye-protection\"><strong>If it’s just a partial eclipse, do I need eye protection?</strong></h2>\n<p>Anything that involves looking at the sun, even just 5 or 10 percent of the sun, <em>requires</em> eye protection. The sun can damage your retinas quickly, painlessly and often irreversibly.</p>\n<p>If you have solar viewers left from the 2024 eclipse, and they are undamaged, they’ll work just fine for this one too. According to the American Astronomical Society (AAS), modern eclipse glasses do not expire. It’s worth checking them out thoroughly, though, making sure there are no rips, tears or scratches across the lenses and that the filters and lenses are still attached to the frame.</p>\n<p>Solar eclipse glasses can be difficult to purchase at the last minute, so it’s always good to keep them around. However, if you donated or trashed your previous pair (or didn’t buy them in the first place), you can buy them online — with some caution. Make sure any solar viewers conform to the ISO 12312-2:2015(E) international safety standard, and check the manufacturer against this<a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/viewers-filters\"> list of brands from the AAS</a>.

When the sun rises during an eclipse (and therefore the sun is low on the horizon), as the crescent sun rises, it can look like devil horns coming up out of the ground.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/b910aff0-0b16-11f0-bdbd-24a9625e5a25\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/b910aff0-0b16-11f0-bdbd-24a9625e5a25\" style=\"height:4160px;width:6240px;\" alt=\"Between layers of clouds, a partial solar eclipse is seen at sunrise over Rice Lake, Ontario, as the sun, partially covered by the moon, rises in a beautiful orange sky above the trees and water.\" data-uuid=\"829aee11-4b67-3b45-8a51-073be3b65b83\"><figcaption>An earlier sunrise partial eclipse over Rice Lake, Ontario shows the \"devil horns\" phenomenon.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">John Fader via Getty Images</div></figure>\n<p>It’s best to target Maine, New Brunswick, and Quebec (along the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5510/\">blue line in the NASA map</a>) to see this phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the sun is currently at or near solar maximum, which means that our star is basically at the peak of its 11-year solar cycle. Scientists determined that the sun hit the highest level of solar activity in October 2024, and this will continue for a year or so. This means that there may be sunspots visible on the surface of the sun when the eclipse hits. (For context, here’s what the sun<a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_1024_HMIIF.jpg\"> looks like right now</a>, courtesy of NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory.) If you have solar binoculars or a solar telescope, this will make them much easier to see.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-can-i-just-point-a-telescope-or-camera-at-the-sun\"><strong>Can I just point a telescope or camera at the sun?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you’re asking yourself this question, you probably already know the answer: Nope! Not without a solar filter. Whether it’s a phone camera, binoculars, a telescope or a mirrorless camera, the sun can do extreme damage to this kind of equipment. (On Apollo 12, astronaut Alan Bean accidentally pointed a television camera at the sun,<a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/seeing-apollo-12\"> irreparably damaging it</a>. Don’t do this!)</p>\n<p>You can pick up solar filters at a camera store or online, or in a pinch, you can just use an extra pair of solar viewers. Simply remove the film and tape it over your smartphone camera, but don’t look at the sun when aiming the camera unless you’re wearing solar viewers as well.

It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands.</p> \n<p>Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness.</p> \n<p>If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/one-of-our-favorite-air-purifiers-is-down-to-a-near-record-low-price-for-the-amazon-spring-sale-133052069.html?src=rss",

It’s a larger audience than you might think.</p>\n<div id=\"c72e24917b174a2ab7e3abff16fc1803\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ2Zdn5w6Dk?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div>\n<p>I played about 45 minutes of <em>Baby Steps</em> at GDC 2025 while Boch, Cuzzillo and Foddy looked on and intermittently told me how good I was at walking. The game stars Nate, an unemployed adult dude who lives in his parents’ basement, as he explores an arid mountain landscape one shaky, unsure step at a time. Maneuvering his body in the proper way is the main goal, and it’s a tricky one. Using a gamepad, you control Nate’s legs individually, one per trigger, and his limbs are incredibly sensitive to small changes in button depression. Pull a trigger tight to lift and bend one of his knees, and release it bit by bit to swing out his lower leg and place his foot precisely where it needs to be. Press forward with the left stick to give Nate just the right amount of momentum, get your trigger rhythm right, and suddenly, hey, you’re walking here.</p>\n<p>It sounds easier than it is. Thanks to the game’s incredibly precise mechanics, Nate falls over easily, faceplanting in the dirt and tumbling backward over rocky slopes like a ragdoll, covering his grey onesie in mud and sweat. This same precision also makes Nate shockingly sturdy at times, like when he pulls his whole body onto a ledge with a single step, ending in a perfectly balanced flamingo stance. There’s room in the controls for both mastery and mayhem, and by the time I put down the gamepad, I was walking Nate around with all the grace of a perfectly adequate five-year-old. I was proud of this accomplishment, too, damn it.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d9cf9db0-0b65-11f0-bfff-d1a31dfaf0a1\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d9cf9db0-0b65-11f0-bfff-d1a31dfaf0a1\" style=\"height:720px;width:1280px;\" alt=\"Baby Steps\" data-uuid=\"90dcdfd9-e96b-3816-a400-c0065b8f0d95\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devolver Digital</div></figure>\n<p>Literally placing one foot in front of the other requires so much concentration in the game’s first few minutes that it’s easy to ignore Nate’s surroundings, but as walking becomes easier, you’re finally able to look around and ask, “What the hell am I doing here?” The first two chapters of <em>Baby Steps</em> are set on a mountainside dotted with craggy rocks, patches of brown grass, long-abandoned wooden buildings, random carousel horses and dirt pits, and the only indication of where to go is an orange glow emanating from a ridgeline high above Nate’s spawn point.</p>\n<p>The few folks Nate meets along the way — a charmingly aloof guide and at least one other, much more prepared hiker — are incredibly entertaining to interact with, but they’re also pretty unhelpful with existential questions. Nate murmurs and monosyllabizes his way through conversations, and he tends to get cut off by the NPCs’ eager observations. Like when I was playing, Nate fell and got stuck at the bottom of a muddy hole, and his guide friend showed up and immediately said, “This hole used to be dry. Hey, did you pee in the hole? <em>Did you pee in this hole?</em>” In response, Nate made anxious noises and generally panicked.</p>\n<p>The comedy in <em>Baby Steps</em> is sharp and chaotic, with a delirious, improvised edge. Foddy does the voice work for most of the characters, and he tends to just make up their lines at the mic. The result is a messy yet refreshing conversational flow, and every cutscene I encountered made me chuckle.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d9cf9db1-0b65-11f0-a63f-fff2fbd78691\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d9cf9db1-0b65-11f0-a63f-fff2fbd78691\" style=\"height:720px;width:1280px;\" alt=\"Baby Steps\" data-uuid=\"9bd59ee4-c86e-35b9-97c4-0df0eaef9eea\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devolver Digital</div></figure>\n<p>Most aspects of <em>Baby Steps</em> made me smile, in fact. At one point I entered a fast-walking groove while wandering along a rocky path on the edge of the canyon, and I realized the birdsong and the thuds of my own steps had morphed into a rhythmic song, encouraging my gait with a steady, organic beat. The game’s soundscape comes courtesy of Boch, and it intentionally ebbs and flows according to the way you play the game. Combine this responsive, immersive soundtrack with the constant focus you have to keep on Nate’s movements, and <em>Baby Steps</em> quickly becomes a hypnotic experience. The game’s details only encourage this feeling — the mountain is strangely beautiful, rendered in crisp 3D graphics, and it’s completely explorable, with no invisible walls in sight. If you can see it, you can attempt to climb it. Nate’s onesie collects sweat along the small of his back, under his arms, and in all the crannies you’d expect, and it also picks up mud when he falls, but the stains wash away when you get in water. On-screen prompts are rare. There are hidden hats to wear and penis graffiti to admire, and Nate can take numerous paths to reach the same point, bouncing pancake butt leading the way.</p>\n<p>Behind all the absurdity, <em>Baby Steps</em> is an incredibly well-crafted, hyper-detailed relaxation tool. While it is laugh-out-loud funny, its mechanics cut deeper than its oddball trailers suggest, and in practice, it actually left me feeling meditative. <em>Baby Steps</em> is a serious silly game.</p>\n<p><em>Baby Steps</em> is being published by Devolver Digital, and it’s due to hit <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008588/\">PS5</a> and PC <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281040/Baby_Steps/\">via Steam</a> later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/baby-steps-preview-serious-gameplay-in-a-silly-walking-sim-150008737.html?src=rss",

You can adjust the webcam-style camera to a variety of angles. It's weather-resistant, so you can place it outside if you have a special power adapter.

You'll just need to have a Blink account before you can actually use it. As you might expect, you'll be able to view images captured by the Mini 2 via the Alexa app on an Echo Show, Fire Tablet or Fire TV but, curiously, not iOS or Android. To see the captures on your phone or tablet, you'll instead need to use the Blink app. You'll get some extra features — such as cloud storage and people and pet detection — if you sign up for the Blink Subscription ($3 per month for one camera, $10 per month for any number).</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in the sale, a five-pack of the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras is <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=87d39e12-7270-4fee-afab-9579352b6293&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0JsaW5rLU91dGRvb3ItNHRoLUdlbi01LUNhbWVyYS9kcC9CMEIxTjRMTTRKP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg3ZDM5ZTEyLTcyNzAtNGZlZS1hZmFiLTk1NzkzNTJiNjI5MyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CbGluay1PdXRkb29yLTR0aC1HZW4tNS1DYW1lcmEvZHAvQjBCMU40TE00SiIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYO9z-eB8LmXZBubhsnWKey_iS9P3mvdUjksEoBj4Lek&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlink-Outdoor-4th-Gen-5-Camera%2Fdp%2FB0B1N4LM4J\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-4th-Gen-5-Camera/dp/B0B1N4LM4J?ref_=automaticdeals_bs_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">half off at $200</a>.

Nevertheless, this is a good sale price overall; you can grab them on discount in either the silver of smoky pink colors.</p> \n<p>There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony's XM5 headphones are one of them. I've raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they're so comfortable. I've worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1ac44183cd18494aa9f35b4e3c702314\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XSDMT4F/ref=twister_B0DVBB1P9M?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they're a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn't hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don't have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Their excellence on flights isn't the only reason we gave Sony's XM5 headphones a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478-160045458.html\">95 in our review</a>. They're also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound's quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don't fold up, but especially at this price, they're still such a great buy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This discount is part of a larger <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0546f03f-780a-4149-8dec-b500ea48d48a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2V2ZW50cy9iaWdzcHJpbmdzYWxlP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA1NDZmMDNmLTc4MGEtNDE0OS04ZGVjLWI1MDBlYTQ4ZDQ4YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ldmVudHMvYmlnc3ByaW5nc2FsZSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATwOaAhU59YDZ4JMGaXGcUKUz6lSZr7IWv5apVQInoG1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fevents%2Fbigspringsale\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/events/bigspringsale?ref_=nav_cs_gb&amp;discounts-widget=%2522%257B%255C%2522state%255C%2522%253A%257B%255C%2522refinementFilters%255C%2522%253A%257B%255C%2522departments%255C%2522%253A%255B%255C%2522493964%252F24046923011%255C%2522%255D%257D%257D%252C%255C%2522version%255C%2522%253A1%257D%2522\">sale on headphones and earbuds</a> for the Amazon Spring Sale.

They&#39;d simply have to release it if they&#39;d like to resume watching at normal speed. Some users have had access to the feature <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1i9psl0/2xs_speed_for_watching_reels/\">for a while now</a>, while others <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1e0j7ak/is_the_2x_speed_not_working_anymore_on_reels/\">used to have it</a> until Instagram removed it from their accounts, likely because the app was only testing it out.

Being able to fast-forward Reels has become somewhat of a necessity for a lot of people today, seeing as Instagram&#39;s short-form videos are no longer limited to 15 seconds in length like they used to be. Reels can now be <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-swoops-in-with-3-minute-reels-and-rectangular-profile-grids-as-the-tiktok-ban-gets-real-201316339.html\">as long as three minutes</a>, and there are signs indicating that the app could allow uploads <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reportedly-making-reels-longer-to-take-on-tiktok-and-youtube-163059898.html\">as long as 10 minutes</a>. We wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Instagram started allowing Reels that long in the future. Instagram and TikTok have had history of adopting new features previously unveiled by the other, and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/camera-tools\">TikTok allows</a> videos recorded within its app to be 10 minutes long.

Additional fees will be imposed on imported components too like engines, transmissions, powertrains and electrical components.

But the move has been taken under the guise of “protecting” America’s car industry from imports.</p>\n<p>Of course, hefty tariffs are no guarantee consumers will flock to buy American if other brands are pricier. We’ve been here before: The ’70s oil shock meant bulky and inefficient American cars were suddenly money pits.

The end result, however, may likely erode any sort of advantage the US auto industry has, allowing China the chance to race ahead in the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>— Dan Cooper</p>\n<p><em>Get this delivered  direct to your inbox.</em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/\"><em> Subscribe right here!</em></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>The biggest tech stories you missed</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/the-pentagon-warns-government-officials-that-signal-is-being-targeted-by-russian-hackers-203436757.html\"><ins>The Pentagon warns government officials that Signal is being targeted by Russian hackers</ins><br></a>I’m not sure why we should worry, it’s not as if government officials are secretly using Signal to agree war plans, are they?!

Most wireless extenders plug into an AC outlet and connect to your existing router so they can then rebroadcast it to spots that your router alone may not cover well. As a rule of thumb, you’ll get the best results by placing the extender half way between your router and the dead zone you’re trying to fix.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>One important thing to note about Wi-Fi range extenders (also sometimes called “repeaters”) is that most of them actually create a new Wi-Fi network when rebroadcasting your existing one. That network will have a new name (it’ll often be your default network’s name with an EXT appended at the end, unless you change it) and that means you’ll have to connect to different networks when in different parts of your home. While that’s a small tradeoff in return for improved coverage, some will be more inconvenienced than others.</p> \n<p>If you’d rather have one, much larger network in your home, you’re better off upgrading to mesh networking systems. Mesh systems come with a main router and access points that, by default, create one large Wi-Fi system that should be accessible throughout your whole home. They tend to be the best Wi-Fi routers you can get, but that also translates to more expensive, and possibly more complicated, devices. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are, by far, more costly than a simple extender, plus you may have to work with your ISP to get your home’s existing network working on your new router.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-wi-fi-extender\">What to look for in a Wi-Fi extender</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-speed\">Speed</h3> \n<p>Extenders today can support single, dual or tri-band Wi-Fi, and they will tell you the maximum speeds they support on all of their available bands. For example, one dual-band device might support 600Mbps speeds over its 2.4GHz band and up to 1300Mbps over its 5GHz band, for a combined maximum speed of 1900Mbps. For the best performance, you’ll want to go with a Wi-Fi extender that has the highest speeds possible (and those, as you might expect, tend to cost more). Some extenders even support Wi-Fi 7, giving you the latest in wireless technology for higher bandwidth, faster speeds and lower latency.</p> \n<p>However, it’s important to remember that Wi-Fi extenders are not true “signal boosters” since they are not designed to <em>increase</em> speeds across your home. In fact, you may find that the extender’s network is slower than your router’s. Instead, extenders are designed to increase the strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, making them ideal for filling in dead zones. Some mesh extenders can help create a more seamless network, reducing the drop in speed and improving connectivity in larger spaces.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-range-and-number-of-supported-devices\">Range, and number of supported devices</h3> \n<p>With the name of the gaming being coverage area, taking note of a device’s range is important. Depending on the size of your home and property, you may only need up to 1,200 square feet of coverage. But those with larger homes will want to spring for an extender that can support upwards of 2,000+ square feet of coverage.</p> \n<p>Similarly, those with lots of gadgets will want an extender that can handle them all at once. If you spend most of your time on your phone or laptop and maybe have your smart TV online for a few hours of Netflix each day, you could get by with a more limited extender. Smart home aficionados and tech lovers should invest in one that won’t buckle under the pressure of a few dozen connected devices. This is especially important if you plan on linking all of the devices in a certain part of your home to your Wi-Fi range extender’s network, rather than directly to your existing router. Some models with external antennas can improve performance by providing stronger, more directional signal coverage.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>There isn’t a ton of innovation when it comes to design in the Wi-Fi extender space. Most of the ones you’ll find today are rounded rectangles roughly the size of your hand that plug into a standard wall outlet. They usually have a few indicator lights that will show you when the extender is connected, how strong its signal strength is and when there’s a problem, and some will even have moveable external antennas that companies claim provide even better Wi-Fi signal. Generally, they are pretty simple to install and get connected, but if you’re struggling with how to set up your Wi-Fi extender, there are plenty of YouTube videos you can check out.</p> \n<p>Aside from that, there are the scant few standalone Wi-Fi extenders that sit on an end table or a desk, and those look pretty similar to regular ol’ routers. But make no mistake, anything labeled as an extender or a “Wi-Fi repeater” will need an anchor router in order for it to work.</p> \n<p>Another convenient feature you’ll find on most Wi-Fi extenders is an extra Ethernet port (or a few). This allows you to use the extender as a Wi-Fi access point if you connect it to your existing router, or an adapter to provide devices like TVs, smart home hubs or game consoles a hardwired connection to the internet. Unsurprisingly, this wired connection usually provides you with the fastest speeds possible, so you may want to use it for your most crucial devices.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wi-fi-extender-faqs\">Wi-Fi extender FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-wifi-booster-and-extender\">What's the difference between a wifi booster and extender?</h3> \n<p>Nowadays, there’s really no difference between a Wi-Fi booster and Wi-Fi extender - they’re just different names for the same thing. Previously, however, Wi-Fi boosters were devices that received signals from wireless routers, broadcasting them to another network. This essentially extends the range of the signal. Wi-Fi extenders expand the coverage within your home’s Wi-Fi network, but often you will see extenders described as boosters.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-a-wi-fi-extender-better-than-a-mesh-router\">Is a Wi-Fi extender better than a mesh router?</h3> \n<p>Mesh routers, or mesh Wi-Fi systems, use multiple devices (or nodes) across your home to create a larger home network. Essentially, you have multiple routers around your home with these systems, and that will hopefully provide the best coverage possible. Wi-Fi extenders, on the other hand, are usually just one device that extends your existing Wi-Fi signal, and they often require you to switch networks when connecting. Wi-Fi extenders are more affordable, though, and are great if you’re traveling or need a Wi-Fi signal in harder-to-reach areas. However, a mesh router can offer a better long-term solution to upgrade your entire home’s Wi-Fi.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-should-i-use-multiple-wi-fi-extenders\">Should I use multiple Wi-Fi extenders?</h3> \n<p>Some people may need to use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, for instance, if your home is large or has dead zones in different areas. But if you do use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, there’s a chance of interference. You may also need to manually connect to the extenders separately, which isn’t always convenient.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html?src=rss",

Smaller companies like Onyx Boox and PocketBook produce Android tablets with e-paper screens that can do more than just display books.<br><br>Other considerations, such as whether or not you need a color display or the ability to write on the screen for note-taking, will determine which ereader to buy. Factors like library size, compatibility with rights-managed content and more also come into play. Over the past two years, we’ve tested out more than a dozen devices to create a guide to help you pick the best ereader for you — and help you get the most out of your new gadget once you get it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-the-best-ebook-readers-for-2025\">Best ereaders</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader\">What to look for in an ereader</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-to-get-books-for-your-ereader\">How to get books for your ereader</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-we-test-ereaders\">How we test ereaders</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-ebook-readers-for-2025\">The best ebook readers for 2025</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1274c90c9fde47829265f8da658feb74\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-clara-colour\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"9fc1c2819e014c8d97210c838b03af76\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"61cf957b946140ab8f21b982cd8635fb\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"fa35d953a61f44fd8de06f5da06c4cbf\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPP8C33\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"bc9202d0f3024d3d9066d714527f1148\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://shop.boox.com/products/gocolor7\" data-original-url-bc920-btn-0=\"https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Go-Color-ePaper/dp/B0D4DN8N8W?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"de6aca0140fe475ea386587a3a0ec2ab\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Palma-Mobile-ePaper-G-Sensor/dp/B0CQ7VRNFS\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader\">What to look for in an ereader</h2> \n<p>Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on a phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Color ereaders add a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido\">color filter array</a> on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.</p> \n<p>Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.</p> \n<p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">E Ink tablets</a> like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-reading-features\"><strong>Reading features</strong></h3> \n<p>With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p> \n<p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.</p> \n<p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-other-features\"><strong>Other features</strong></h3> \n<p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html\">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read <em>Crook Manifesto</em>.</p> \n<p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p> \n<p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read.

It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-upload-epubs-onto-an-ereader\"><strong>How to upload ePubs onto an ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Stores like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/\">ebooks.com</a> and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books?hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Google Play</a> have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Titles from some publishers like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/publisher/tor-publishing-group/207044153?_c=1\">Tor</a> and public domain classics from sites like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:17;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">Project Gutenberg</a> are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader <em>do</em> support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.</p> \n<p>To do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called <a data-i13n=\"cpos:18;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7247b01c-2a32-4141-aac1-4e4bb8170ec0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rite+Aid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjQ3YjAxYy0yYTMyLTQxNDEtYWFjMS00ZTRiYjgxNzBlYzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL3NvbHV0aW9ucy9lYm9vay9kaWdpdGFsLWVkaXRpb25zL2Rvd25sb2FkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYfVa2G0Z86CjcQZkqWy4CaRDfMi0aF2N0kUMd-_t-hK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html\">Adobe Digital Editions</a> (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover.

But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg.

Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.</p> \n<p>Recently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:23;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/bookshoporg-is-now-selling-ebooks-113033975.html\">up to 100 percent of the profits</a> will go to local booksellers.

Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs.</p> \n<p>To read library books on a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:28;pos:1\" href=\"https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html\">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p> \n<p>For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.</p> \n<p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/0376ace0-cf17-11ed-8f7e-8cbebb86b05f\" alt=\"Four ereaders are arranged on a dark brown wooden table outside.

data-i13n=\"cpos:45;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html\">Amazon’s first color Kindle</a> impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.</p> \n<p>Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\"</p> \n<p>Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-which-ereaders-can-read-kindle-books\"><strong>Which ereaders can read Kindle books?</strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-you-buy-kindle-books-without-a-kindle\"><strong>Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?</strong></h3> \n<p>Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can <em>only</em> be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-kindle-and-kobo\"><strong>What's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?</strong></h3> \n<p>Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.</p> \n<p>The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store.

Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>March 2025</strong>: Added news about Bookshop.org getting into the ebook market.

The company also reaffirmed that the upcoming console will be backwards compatible with Switch games.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While the reveal did confirm some rumors and have a few interesting details for those who were paying close attention, Nintendo is still largely keeping its cards close to its chest. We'll have to wait until a special Nintendo Direct at 9AM ET on April 2 for all the juicy information. Before that, we'll just have to gaze at the sleeves on the Seattle Mariners' jerseys this year — <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.mlb.com/press-release/press-release-seattle-mariners-expand-relationship-with-nintendo-with-team-s-first-ever-jersey-sleeve-partnership\">Nintendo and the MLB team announced</a> they'll have a Nintendo logo on the sleeve of the home jersey and a Switch 2 logo on the away jersey.

It's a portable console with detachable Joy-Cons. The Switch 2 can be placed in a dock for big-screen gaming. There are some significant differences from the original console, however.</p>\n<p>The most obvious one is that the next-gen Joy-Cons will no longer slide into place mechanically. Instead, they appear to attach to the main unit magnetically. There is a small connector that's likely used to charge the controllers. It's unclear at this point if Joy-Cons from the original system will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p>\n<p>One other big (and very welcome) change is the addition of a second USB-C port on the top of the device. That should make it much easier to plug in accessories while the Switch 2 is docked. FCC filings suggest that you'll be able to charge the console using either USB-C port, which is another nice quality-of-life change.</p>\n<p>It's great to see that Nintendo has kept the headphone jack as well. Let's just hope that Bluetooth headphone support is live from the jump this time and Nintendo doesn't leave everyone <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-011133744.html\">waiting <em>four years</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>for that feature.</p>\n<p>The kickstand is getting an upgrade. As with the Switch OLED, it spans the length of the console this time around. But, according to the reveal trailer, this one looks fully adjustable, so you can tweak the viewing angle to one that works for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are still a great many unknowns regarding the upcoming console. We don't really know the specs yet, or what type of display it uses. We also don't know anything about battery life, the UI or launch games. We'll surely learn a whole lot on April 2.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-come-out\">When will <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 </strong>come out?</h2>\n<p>2025. That's all we know for sure at this point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's highly unlikely that Nintendo will release the console before the dedicated Direct on April 2, and not only because that's at the start of Nintendo's next financial year. However, accessory manufacturer Genki, which has been a major source of leaks in recent months, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/01/08/nintendo-accessory-maker-claims-switch-2-is-launching-in-april-mock-up-based-on-actual-console/\">claims the console will be released in April</a>. Other reports have pegged June as the release window, as have several analysts.</p>\n<p>In any case, we should learn the release date during the April 2 Direct.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-can-i-try-the-nintendo-switch-2\">When can I try the Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>\n<p>Nintendo is planning a worldwide roadshow to let gamers go hands-on with the console. These events start in New York and Paris on April 4-6, with others taking place throughout the following two months. That lends credence to some suggestions that Nintendo will release the Switch 2 in June.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ticket registration for many of the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events has closed, but <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/\">waitlists</a> <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/nintendo-switch-2-experience/\">are available</a>. However, given that Nintendo is taking a first come, first served approach, your chances of attending the roadshow if you don't already have a ticket (or unless you signed up for the waitlist immediately) seem very small at this point.</p>\n<p>The full list of Nintendo Switch 2 Experience dates is as follows:</p>\n<p>North America:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>New York, April 4-6, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Los Angeles, April 11-13, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Dallas, April 25-27, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Toronto, April 25-27, 2025</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Europe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Paris, April 4-6, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>London, April 11-13, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Milan, April 25-27, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Berlin, April 25-27, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Madrid, May 9-11, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Amsterdam, May 9-11, 2025</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oceania:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Melbourne, May 10-11, 2025</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Tokyo (Makuhari), April 26-27, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Seoul, May 31-June 1, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Hong Kong, To be announced</p></li>\n<li><p>Taipei, To be announced</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-have-some-weirdness\">Will the Nintendo Switch 2 have some weirdness?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Everything we've seen and so far about this console has been fairly, well, traditional. It looks like the original Switch, but better. That's awesome, but will there be any of that unpredictable Nintendo magic? Maybe! There are two puzzling additions that folks can't make hide nor hair of.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"f59216adba4b480bba6dc0ad0294c9e2\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Genki, the accessories manufacturer, just published a landing page for their Nintendo Switch 2 accessories.

This has led to speculation that players will be able to flip the Joy-Con over and use it like a mouse.

That would align with the magnetic Joy-Con attachment scheme.</p>\n<p>But much like the weird mouse rumors, it doesn’t necessarily align with, well, any logical reason for why you’d want to do that. The patent suggests it could allow for more user choice in where the headphone jack is. But since it’s Nintendo, the company that brought us <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-26-nintendo-labo-review.html\">Labo cardboard peripherals</a> and the Game Boy Advance e-reader <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_e-Reader\">attachment</a>, we have to wonder if there are… quirkier designs at hand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible\">Is <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 </strong>backwards compatible?</h2>\n<p>The company confirmed in November 2024 that the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/youll-be-able-to-play-your-nintendo-switch-games-on-its-successor-045657774.html\">Nintendo Switch 2 will be backwards compatible.</a> It will also feature access to Nintendo Online, so users will be able to play all of those old retro titles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the initial Nintendo Switch 2 press release, Nintendo reiterated that physical and digital Switch games will work on the new system. However, it noted that \"certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.\" More details about which games those are will be revealed later.</p>\n<p>During a Nintendo Direct on March 27, the company revealed a new system for loaning digital Switch games out to friends and family members. <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-just-introduced-a-way-to-loan-out-digital-games-to-friends-and-family-150733308.html\">Virtual Game Cards</a> are designed to make it easier to start a game on one console and continue on another as well. Although Nintendo's approach to this is <a data-i13n=\"cpos:17;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-digital-switch-game-sharing-plan-could-be-so-much-simpler-190353732.html\">not as simple as it perhaps should be</a>, Virtual Game Cards will also be available on the Switch 2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-will-old-games-be-enhanced-in-any-way\">Will old games be enhanced in any way?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The original Switch has, to put it mildly, struggled to run <a data-i13n=\"cpos:18;pos:1\" href=\"https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-game-frame-rate/\">some of the late-generation software</a> that's come down the pike. Could these games be enhanced to take advantage of the increased horsepower of the Switch 2? We have no idea. We also don't know if any of these releases will receive graphical upgrades, perhaps taking advantage of upscaling tech.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-cartridges-taste-like\">What will the cartridges taste like?</h2>\n<p>You may remember that the original Switch cartridges <a data-i13n=\"cpos:19;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/1/14784140/nintendo-switch-cartridges-taste-awful-psa\">taste absolutely awful</a>. This was on purpose, to discourage folks from putting the games in their mouth. Will the successor follow suit and continue to dip cartridges in a foul-tasting bitter coating? Only time will tell.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-specs\">What about specs?</h2>\n<p>The rumors regarding specs are all over the place, so it’s tough to pin down. We know one thing for sure: It’ll be more powerful than the ancient Switch hardware, which was already antiquated back in 2017. One analyst allegedly got a hold of a spec sheet from the <em>Korean United Daily News</em> that said the Switch 2 <a data-i13n=\"cpos:20;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-disappointingly-underpowered-heres-what-we-know\">would boast an eight-core Cortex-A78AE processor</a>, 8GB of RAM and 64GB of internal eMMC storage. This tracks, as these specs are about as underpowered now as the original Switch was in 2017. However, some reports <a data-i13n=\"cpos:21;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/\">do indicate that the console</a> will include 12GB of RAM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another source suggests that the eight-core CPU will be packaged inside an NVIDIA-produced <a data-i13n=\"cpos:22;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\">Tegra239 SoC (system on a chip)</a>. Given the current Switch runs on an NVIDIA chip, that makes a lot of sense. The CPU will be more powerful, but it's the Switch 2's new GPU that will be a major differentiator. It's all-but-confirmed that the Switch 2 will support DLSS, NVIDIA's \"deep learning supersampling\" upscaling tech, which would allow the console to render games at a low resolution internally while outputting a high-resolution image. (Fun fact: We actually wrote about <a data-i13n=\"cpos:23;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-14-nvidia-rtx-mesh-shaders-dlss-tensor-cores.html\">how perfect DLSS was for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> when the technology was announced alongside the RTX 20 series back in 2018.)</p>\n<p>There are still questions about the Switch 2 and DLSS: Will the system support <a data-i13n=\"cpos:24;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html\">newer DLSS features like frame generation</a>? Will existing games be automatically tidied up by NVIDIA's algorithm? Regardless of the exact implementation, DLSS upscaling will be a huge leap over the rudimentary techniques available to Nintendo Switch developers.</p>\n<p>As for the display, there are many conflicting rumors. Early reports from solid sources suggested the Switch 2 would have an 8-inch LCD screen. The Switch 2's display certainly looks larger than that of the original Switch in a side-by-side comparison in the reveal trailer. Some folks have worried that the Switch follow-up <a data-i13n=\"cpos:25;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/what-if-the-nintendo-switch-2-is-too-big-150002921.html\">may actually be too big</a>, especially for kids.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Certain analysts have suggested this would be an OLED screen, while others have said it would be a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:26;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-pro-could-sport-a-mini-led-display-heres-why-that-matters\">Mini-LED display</a>. A Mini-LED display is basically an LCD display that has a backlight made of (surprise!) mini-LEDs rather than edge lighting. This allows for local dimming, making the blacks more black.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We're hedging our bets here. We think it’ll be a standard LCD, to cut costs, with an OLED or Mini-LED model coming later down the line. However, Mini-LED screens are slightly cheaper than OLED displays, so that’s certainly a possibility at launch.</p>\n<p>As for resolution, recent reporting suggests that the console will output 1080p in handheld and 4K when docked. That's much better than the OG Switch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More <a data-i13n=\"cpos:27;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/gamestops-internal-database-lists-multiple-switch-2-accessory-skus\">tenuous “leaks”</a> have <a data-i13n=\"cpos:28;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/lexar-is-apparently-releasing-a-switch-2-microsd-express-card\">intimated</a> that the Switch 2 could also support a faster microSD card standard known as microSD Express. This allows for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:29;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/bus-speed-default-speed-high-speed-uhs-sd-express/\">significantly faster</a> transfer rates than the common UHS-I cards supported by the Switch today.

But again, these rumors are far from concrete. It’s also worth noting that microSD Express cards cost significantly more than what we usually see today — the SanDisk card we tested, for instance, starts at $45 for just 128GB of storage.</p>\n<p>Recently-unearthed FCC filings also indicate <a data-i13n=\"cpos:34;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-will-feature-wifi-6-and-offer-nfc-support-per-the-fcc-192242046.html\">that the console will support Wi-Fi 6 and NFC</a>. The latter indicates that the Switch 2 will continue Amiibo integration.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost\">How much will the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?</h2>\n<p>We don't have too much information regarding price but we do have plenty of history to work with. The original Nintendo Switch launched at $300, which is pretty much the \"magic number\" when it comes to Nintendo console releases in recent years. The Wii U also came in at $300.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, there are plenty of rumors circulating that Nintendo could be upping the asking price for the Switch 2. Several analysts are expecting Nintendo to hike the price to at least $400 and possibly even as much as $500. Rising costs of components and development, as well as US tariffs, are likely to mean that the Switch 2 is more expensive than its predecessor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dipping back into history, there is some precedence for a price uptick. The GameCube was $200 and the Wii was $250. The Wii U and Switch increased to $300 and, well, numbers like to go up. A $400 price tag would make the Switch 2 nearly as expensive as a PS5 and Xbox Series X. That would also put it at the same price as the 256GB LCD Steam Deck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Again, we should get confirmation of the price during the April 2 Nintendo Direct.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-well-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-sell\">How well will the Nintendo Switch 2 sell?</h2>\n<p>Even with an expected price increase, Nintendo is likely to sell boatloads of Switch 2 consoles. The company seems to be positioning itself to shatter sales records. Reports suggest that Nintendo wants to have as many units ready to sell as possible on release day. One analyst told <a data-i13n=\"cpos:35;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> that they expected Nintendo to have an inventory of between 6 million and 8 million units at the outset.</p>\n<p>As <em>Bloomberg </em>notes, the company sold 2.7 million Switch units in that console's first month. Sony's PS4 and PS5 each sold 4.5 million units in their first quarter on the market, though it's worth noting the PS5's early momentum was <a data-i13n=\"cpos:36;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-short-supply-through-2022-090543238.html\">hindered somewhat by shortages</a>.</p>\n<p>Nintendo has sold <a data-i13n=\"cpos:37;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-sees-sales-dip-as-switch-2-debut-looms-130047928.html\">more than 150 million Switch units</a>. Given that many fans are more than ready for an upgrade (and to perhaps give their old Switch to a young relative or sell it on the cheap), the Switch 2 is very likely to go gangbusters right out of the gate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-do-we-know-about-any-launch-games\">Do we know about any launch games?</h2>\n<p>Not so much. The reveal trailer offered a peek at a new Mario Kart game. Nintendo released <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>on the Wii U over a decade ago and it's been milking that cash cow ever since, having sold more than 64 million copies of the game across that console and the Switch. It's definitely time for a new entry!</p>\n<p>It's certainly <a data-i13n=\"cpos:38;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-26-super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-review.html\">been a long time since</a> we’ve gotten a proper 3D Mario adventure as well, so a new one could be a launch title. That would be one heck of a system seller. Other than that, your guess is as good as ours. Past as prologue, we can expect something from Ubisoft and an off-the-wall title like <em>1-2-Switch</em>. One report suggested that <a data-i13n=\"cpos:39;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/powerwash-simulator-2-will-arrive-later-this-year-164534571.html\"><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></a> is bound for the Switch 2, so that's something.</p>\n<div id=\"e52c76b4c1064d809c9c32a002b0c09a\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMAgmdR8jwU?si=wFpt_JElWcUNSKqL\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If there’s a gimmick or hook involved with the console, we’ll also get a game that takes advantage of that. A dual release of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, just like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em> before that, is also a possibility.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's all but nailed on that we'll learn much more about the Switch 2 launch lineup during the April 2 Nintendo Direct, which starts at 9AM ET.

The biggest announcement from the company&#39;s latest Direct was its upcoming <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-just-introduced-a-way-to-loan-out-digital-games-to-friends-and-family-150733308.html\">Virtual Game Cards feature</a>, a new approach to sharing digital games that improves on the company&#39;s current system, but still carries limitations that keep it from feeling truly modern.</p>\n<p>Virtual Game Cards attempt to make digital games as easy to share as physical ones. That starts with the company visually representing games as &quot;cards&quot; and using the language of loading and ejecting them, and extends to how simple they are to share. Two Switch consoles logged into your Nintendo Account can share any digital game just by &quot;ejecting&quot; it from one and &quot;loading&quot; it on another. The only catch is that the consoles need to be connected over local wireless (as in, be physically near each other) when the trade happens, and be able to access the internet to download the game and run it for the first time.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"02193b003e30499d863699e9affef616\"><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>You can similarly share a Virtual Game Card with anyone in the same Nintendo Account family group for two weeks, after which the game automatically returns. In both cases, saves for each game stay on the console where the game was played, making it simple to share the Virtual Game Card again and keep playing.</p>\n<p>In comparison to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47524/~/how-to-play-your-games-across-multiple-nintendo-switch-systems\">Nintendo&#39;s current system</a>, which requires defining a Switch console as &quot;primary&quot; and able to be used offline and other devices as a &quot;secondary&quot; and needing an internet connection to play shared games, Virtual Game Cards are a meaningful improvement. If you&#39;re a parent trying to share games with your kids or a super-fan with multiple Switches (something Nintendo no doubt wants to encourage), Virtual Game Cards have basically solved the problem — or at least made it much easier to manage and understand. The company isn&#39;t exactly leading the pack here, though.</p>\n<p>If I own a game on PlayStation, I can download it on my Playstation 4 and PlayStation 5, and play on either console, without needing to go through the rigamarole of ejecting virtual cards. The same goes for Steam games. Valve even goes further and lets the vast majority of games be shared and played on accounts connected to the same <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-families-library-sharing-is-live-and-you-can-all-play-at-the-same-time-231044311.html\">Steam Family</a>, without your computers needing to be near each other when you &quot;hand-off&quot; games.</p>\n<p>People are highly sensitive to any kind of DRM. Just ask Xbox, which had big plans to change how loaning games work when the Xbox One was announced, but had to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-08-xbox-one-drm-reversal-history.html\">dramatically backtrack</a> after basically everyone complained.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nintendo isn&#39;t pulling an Xbox, per se, but it is pitching something adjacent. Virtual Game Cards are inarguably better than how things work now, but they require an internet connection and they still limit how many people can play a game at once. Nintendo came up with a better mental model for sharing games, but not necessarily a better way to do it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-digital-switch-game-sharing-plan-could-be-so-much-simpler-190353732.html?src=rss",

There’s no access to social media, the internet or even email. It’s intended to be, first and foremost, a phone.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"2ad0c30385e5404a8a68418e4d8a8594\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KhMb0-t2MyU?si=kxutWgR18RYNtai7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p>It’s not completely bare. This model includes an embedded NFC chip for making payments, a bare-bones music player, a podcast player, a messaging app, a flashlight, voice notes, a calendar, a timer and an alarm. It also includes a simple camera system that was inspired by point-and-shoot models. There’s a two-step shutter button with center focus and a fixed focal length. The company calls it “genuinely fun.”</p>\n<p>The Light Phone III has a navigation app, which is likely the most useful part of modern smartphones, but with a twist. The company paid for private access to navigational information, so Here (the mapping platform powering the app) has no visibility into where you go or what you search for.</p>\n<p>Other specs include 6GB of RAM, up from 1GB in the Light Phone II, 128GB of memory and a newer Qualcomm chip. It includes a fingerprint ID on the power button, a USB-C port and some loudspeakers at the bottom. The battery is also user-replaceable, which is a huge bonus. It’s larger than previous generations and I find it to be pretty cute. It&#39;s around the width of a modern iPhone, but much shorter. This was on purpose, the company says, to make it easier to text while holding it vertically.</p>\n<div id=\"aa39cedf85d446419d2f2a0ec0197a38\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYFDe9F62VA?si=osluXBBuPOVwZKcz\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p>There is a spot of bad news here. The Light Phone III costs $799, which dwarves the price of the second-gen model (though it is far more capable of a device). That said, you can still put in an order at the pre-order price of $599 for now —&nbsp;we&#39;ll see how long that sticks around for.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, March 27 2025, 1:15PM ET: </strong>This story has been updated to note that the Light Phone navigation app uses Here, not Google for mapping. It also has been updated to note that the $599 pre-order price is still available for now.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-minimalist-light-phone-iii-is-officially-available-for-purchase-150056138.html?src=rss",

Normally priced at $275, this is the best discount we&#39;ve seen on the 2-in-1 robot, matching the sale price we saw during the holiday shopping season last year.</p> \n<p>As you can see in our roundup of the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">best budget robot vacuums</a>, we’ve consistently rated iRobot’s machines highly for their reliability and ease of use. The Roomba Combo Essential is a simple, no-frills option that both vacuums and mops, making it a solid pick for small apartments, dorm rooms or anyone who wants a cleaner floor without spending a fortune.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"bb9d5cbaa11941678737444c519321c5\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVJ3K8FF?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>The vacuum uses special multi-surface brushes to pick up dirt, dust and pet hair from hard floors and carpets. Unlike some budget models that struggle with transitions, this one automatically adjusts to different surfaces, so you won’t have to worry about it getting stuck. When it’s time to mop, the built-in mopping pad wipes down hard floors, tackling light spills and everyday messes. It’s not as advanced as iRobot’s higher-end models with precision scrubbing, but it’s a convenient way to keep your floors looking fresh with minimal effort.</p> \n<p>One of iRobot Roomba Combo Essential&#39;s most convenient features is its auto-adjusting cleaning power — the robot increases suction when it detects extra debris, so it’s more effective on high-traffic areas like entryways or around pet bowls. It also has cliff sensors to prevent it from tumbling down stairs and a low-profile design that helps it slip under some couches and other furniture for a more thorough clean.</p> \n<p>Despite it being an entry-level robot vacuum, the iRobot Roomba Combo Essential comes with app control and voice assistant support, so you can set cleaning schedules and initiate cleaning whether you’re at home lounging on the couch or away on vacation. For $150, this is a solid deal for an iRobot machine that can vacuum and mop, especially considering its usual $275 price tag. If you’ve been thinking about automating some of your floor cleaning, this is one of the most affordable ways to do it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-vacuum-deals-this-irobot-2-in-1-vacuum-and-mop-falls-to-149-123058239.html?src=rss",

Thankfully, Samsung has a solution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its newest cordless stick vac, the new <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/sg/vacuum-cleaners/stick/bespoke-ai-jet-ultra-vs90-black-vs90f40dak-sp/\">Bespoke AI Jet Ultra</a> ($1,099), now has an LCD display control panel that, along with standard features such as power level and battery life, can notify you when you have an incoming phone call or text message. The vacuum, which works with an auto-empty charging station, also features 400AW suction and 100-minute battery life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even better, if you&#8217;re doing the wash and left your phone in the other room, Samsung’s added touchscreens to <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-new-bespoke-ai-laundry-with-ai-home-enables-smarter-more-efficient-laundry-care\">its washers and dryers</a>, including the new <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/washers/all-in-one-washer-dryer-combo/bespoke-5-3-cu-ft-all-in-one-ai-laundry-combo-ultra-capacity-washer-with-super-speed-and-ventless-heat-pump-dryer-in-dark-steel-wd53dba900hza1/\">Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo</a> washer / dryer ($3,099). This lets you answer a call directly on the built-in 7-inch LCD screen. The Combo can also (perhaps more usefully) put detergent in for you automatically and then, when the cycle is done, open its door.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/AI-Vented-Lifestyle-3-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The new Bespoke combo washer and dryer has several tech upgrades, including a new 7-inch touchscreen that you can make phone calls on.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Samsung\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <span>company has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line. At CES this year, Samsung showed off these <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/ces-2025-a-new-era-of-personalized-appliances-samsung-showcases-home-ai-innovations\" target=\"_blank\">AI Home control panels on several appliances</a>, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS</span> and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">AI Home is a new terminology Samsung uses to refer to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. <span>The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down scree</span>n that — like the other AI Home screens — includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, you can still get the fridge with a giant 21.5-inch or 32-inch screen that can run even more apps, including Samsung TV and TikTok. These screens all also work as controls for the appliance and integrate with other Samsung appliances and services, sometimes using AI. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/9-inch-AI-Home-Lifestyle.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For example, on the fridge screen, you can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334411/samsung-instacart-smart-fridge-partnership\">using its AI-powered cameras</a>. You can then send the cooking instructions to your oven and use the screen to view the recipe. It&#8217;s like having your phone with you everywhere, except your hands are free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The AI Home screens can connect to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23743633/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-how-to\">Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform</a>. That means you can get alerts on your appliances about other events in your smart home, for example, you can see (and talk to) whoever is at your Ring video doorbell while unloading the washer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Samsung’s “screens everywhere” approach is part of its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349488/samsung-smartthings-ambient-sensing-home-ai\">AI for the home push</a>, its vision of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349488/samsung-smartthings-ambient-sensing-home-ai\">tech working in the background to help you with your daily life</a>.  While the smart home has plenty of potential to save you time, money, and energy, putting screens into everything feels like overkill. A smart display could serve much of the same purpose, and would probably cost less to replace than a cooktop when you drop a pan on its screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tech-heavy touchscreens built into appliances also feel susceptible to obsolescence, not to mention being more likely to malfunction than that plastic knob on your washing machine. The other concern about screens in the home is that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324086/samsungs-screens-everywhere-initiative\">they could be used to serve up ads</a>, as is the case with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23944889/set-up-echo-show-without-amazon-ads-how-to\">Amazon’s Echo Show smart displays</a>. While Samsung has not done this yet on its appliances, it&#8217;s an understandable worry. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Samsung about these concerns and will follow up with the company’s response.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

We opted for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Soap-Dispenser-Rechargeable-Adjustable/dp/B0C82VLHW3/\">cheap $25 option from Amazon</a>&nbsp;that lets you adjust how much foaming soap is dispensed and lasts for a couple of months between charges, but companies like Simplehuman sell pricier&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/simplehuman-Touch-Free-Automatic-Rechargeable-Stainless/dp/B0CVNHV816/\">$80 versions</a>&nbsp;wrapped in brushed metal or other fancy finishes that could better match your decor. We find we use less soap now that it’s always perfectly portioned out, and buying refills in bulk is much cheaper.

From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat. Sometimes, it’s just easier — and much less stressful — to let the Instant Pot take the wheel.&nbsp;<em>— Emma Roth, news writer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the first things I did when I got my own place was purchase a food chopper. Perhaps puritan chefs will disagree with my methods, but this saves me so much time. I like to make tikka masala, which requires dicing ginger. If you’ve ever tried to dice ginger, you know that a food chopper would come in handy. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Chopper-Vegetable-Durable-Material-Cup-Gray/dp/B097CW44Q5/\">This one</a> did break recently, so I’ll probably replace it with a fancier one.&nbsp;<em>— Kylie Robison, senior AI reporter</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Infant &amp; child care</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D50RYSC/\">Yogasleep Hushh</a> is a small, portable white noise machine.

It has three different white noise options. It can run on battery for up to 24 hours, and you can charge it with a USB-C cable. It even comes with a ring to attach it to things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My wife and I turn on the Hushh every time we put our baby down to sleep.

It lets you build complicated marble runs using myriad components, including ramps, risers, bridges, switches, and launchers — and that’s just the starter set.

I have heard from friends that it does not work for every baby, but when it works,&nbsp;<em>it really works</em>&nbsp;— and you have truly magical moments when it successfully puts your baby to sleep. You can control the intensity manually and get nice sleep logs in their proprietary app — though Snoo’s parent company, Happiest Baby,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202166/snoo-premium-subscription-happiest-baby\">has come under fire</a>&nbsp;for introducing a new subscription fee of $19.99 / month for the main app functionality after nine months. While infuriating, I was so desperate for sleep, I would still have bought a Snoo. Also, look out for return policies; some parents prefer to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SNOO-Smart-Sleeper-Happiest-Baby/dp/B0716KN18Z/\">buy their Snoos from Amazon</a> to avoid Happiest Baby’s steep $199 restocking fee.&nbsp;<em>– Helen Havlak, publisher</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Garden gadgets</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fungus gnats love overwatered soil, so once you’ve gotten rid of them, you’ve got to be careful and diligent about your watering schedule. For that, I got myself a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08P4LCQWZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gouevn soil moisture meter</a>&nbsp;to teach myself how to properly water my plants.

I’d never even seen these before, so I decided to try them with my orchid. I found that they’re a lot softer than the plastic ties I used previously, and they do a pretty good job at supporting my plants, both indoor and outdoor. You can simply cut the Velcro ties to size, wrap them around your plant, and the tie will stick to itself. They’re reusable, too! <em>— Emma Roth, news writer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Charging gadgets</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p>In my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B078S3M2NX/\">this one from Epicka</a>&nbsp;is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.</p>\n\n<p>The only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. — <em>Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p>Nobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PGZHCXR/\">Anker combination extension cord / power strip</a>. It’s not a full power strip —&nbsp;just a cube with a few sockets along with USB and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. — <em>Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bQmmEy\">Other gadgets</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p>Most of the things I own are, frankly,&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;unreliable enough to be annoying. All except for one or two, and of those, the one I love most of all is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084Z5QZR2/\">Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener</a>&nbsp;for HomeKit. And my love for it isn’t just about its rock-solid performance — it’s because, as far as I can tell, it’s compatible with almost any garage door opener on the market and across&nbsp;<em>time itself.&nbsp;</em>I don’t think that’s an exaggeration, either. The chunky mustard yellow all-metal box that cranks my garage door open — the Model 455 by Automatic Doorman — was made, by my loose estimation, sometime between the fall of Rome and 1975.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But Meross’ adapter was $30 — and to my amazement, after a very simple installation, it worked and continues to do so almost every time I need it to. Best of all, I don’t have to carry the chunky remote with me on my bike when I leave because I can just talk into my Apple Watch when I return and coast right in. — <em>Wes Davis, weekend editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p>I spend the workday at my Vox laptop, a MacBook Pro, with a few accessories, including a pair of Sony&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features\">WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones</a>&nbsp;that my&nbsp;colleague Chris Welch reviewed. — <em>Adi Robertson, senior reporter</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p>I picked up <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BLMQ8BXB\">Hoto’s electric screwdriver</a> because my former boss at <em>The Verge</em>, Dan Seifert, would often pitch it around gift guide season. I’m glad I did, though, because it now sits alongside a handful of tools I use on an almost weekly basis. I wouldn’t suggest using it for <em>real </em>household projects that require some serious torque, but it’s incredibly handy for tightening the legs on my desk, assembling furniture, and making sure my bike seat isn’t going to come off mid-ride. It’s also equipped with a USB-C port for charging, a nifty LED light that lets you ditch the headlamp, and a case for housing the 25 steel bits. Oh, and it really does make for a great little gift.

The Islets are silent linear switches, with an extra-long spring, so the actuation force curve is strongest right at the beginning and then smooth the rest of the way, giving them an almost Topre-like tactile sensation. (Pitchforks down; I said <em>almost</em>.)

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/events/bigspringsale/\">Big Spring Sale</a>, as it is known, is happening now and runs through Monday, March 31st, bringing with it a slew of discounts on gardening supplies, bedding, and other necessities. While the discounts aren’t as steep as during tentpole events like Prime Day or even Amazon’s October event (and the frequency of new deals coming to the surface has slowed down), you can still find steep savings on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-2-TwoCameras-White/dp/B0BWX39R5W/\">security cameras</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489/\">headphones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-41mm-Smartwatch/dp/B0D912YVPQ/\">smartwatches</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D3PB2DBS/?th=1\">best football video game</a> released in the past year, and loads of other tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve dug into all the deals and discounts available so far, the best of which you’ll find below. By and large, most of the deals will last until the end of the event. And, while having a Prime subscription means your packages will certainly arrive more quickly, you don’t necessarily need to be a member to get in on these tried-and-tested <em>Verge</em> favorites (only in rare cases are deals exclusive to Prime members, and we’ll note when that’s the case). We’ll also be keeping an eye on deals at competing retailers, including <a href=\"https://howl.link/mnjvisoyvyd5d\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/l/target-circle-week/-/N-7196o\">Target</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#featured-deals\">Featured deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#robot-vacuum-deals\">Robot vacuum deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#headphone-and-earbud-deals\">Headphone and earbud deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#portable-charger-and-cable-deals\">Portable charger and cable deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#speaker-and-soundbar-deals\">Speaker and soundbar deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#smart-home-deals\">Smart home deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#tablet-and-e-reader-deals\">Tablet and e-reader deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#smartwatch-and-fitness-tracker-deals\">Smartwatch and fitness tracker deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#other-verge-favorites\">Other Verge favorites</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-deals\">Featured deals</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"robot-vacuum-deals\">Robot vacuum deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Dreame L20 Ultra</strong>&nbsp;is on sale for a new low of $549.99 ($450 off) at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Mop-Extend-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling-Avoidance/dp/B0CC236CLT?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0326awD__24114602__________________google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>.

The dual mop pads can still extend to clean baseboard and corners, while its 7,000Pa of suction power does a good job of sucking up unwanted dirt and debris. The robovac is also capable of emptying its own dust bin and water tanks (as well as refilling them), in addition to washing and drying its own mop pads.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Verge </em>smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy recommends the Roborock Q5 Pro for those who want a budget-friendly robot vacuum that’s skilled in the arcane art of sucking up pet hair. Fortunately, the <strong>Q5 Pro Plus</strong> model is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7VN9NWK\">Amazon</a> with its auto-empty bin for just $299.99 ($400 off) — a $70 upcharge on the standard Q50 Pro that’s well worth it if your space has a lot of fur to sweep up.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re looking for an even cheaper robot vacuum, you can buy the&nbsp;<strong>SwitchBot K10 Plus</strong>&nbsp;with a self-emptying dock for a new low of $175.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Self-Empty-Navigation-Compatible-Connected/dp/B0CHBC7BW1?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0326awD__24114602__________________google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>, down from $399.99.&nbsp;The small, quiet robovac only offers 2,500Pa suction, but that’s still powerful enough to suck up dirt from most carpets. It also offers a lidar-based mapping system, and while it lacks bells and whistles like obstacle avoidance, it at least lets you set digital keep-out zones. Plus, as an added bonus, you can use it with disposable mopping pads.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"headphone-and-earbud-deals\">Headphone and earbud deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>Beats Studio Pro </strong>are on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Beats-by-Dr-Dre-Studio-Pro-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Over-Ear-Headphones-Black/1575006069/\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/mhehlm9nwlg67\">Best Buy</a> for $179.95 ($170 off), which remains one of the best prices we’ve seen. Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C. Plus, unlike most noise-canceling headphones, they offer native support for both iOS and Android software features. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23799799/beats-studio-pro-review-apple-google-features\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you prefer a pair of noise-canceling <em>earbuds </em>that support native software features on both iOS and Android, the <strong>Beats Studio Buds Plus </strong>are available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZK2Z2TC/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Beats-Studio-Buds-True-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Earbuds-w-AppleCare-Clear/3635657547\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/lr1p0aa6xv4xx\">Best Buy</a> for around $130 ($40 off), nearly matching their best price to date. Yes, their lack of wireless charging and in-ear detection stings a bit at their typical list price, but their see-through design is slick enough that the shortcomings are (almost) forgivable. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23725921/beats-studio-buds-plus-earbuds-review-translucent-clear\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re not dead set on noise cancellation but would still like a pair of Apple earbuds, the recently released <strong>AirPods 4</strong> are matching their all-time low of $99.99 ($30 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Effortless/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-4/11381374703/\">Walmart</a> right now. They’re a substantial upgrade over the prior model when it comes to call clarity and sound, and they offer the same seamless integration with macOS, iOS, and tvOS as the rest of Apple’s earbuds. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2e</strong> — aka, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best-sounding wireless headphones</a> you can buy — are available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Over-Ear-Headphones-Model/dp/B0CH1NLX7K/\">Amazon</a> starting at $295.60 (about $103 off), or from <a href=\"https://www.bowerswilkins.com/en-us/product/over-ear-headphones/px7-s2e/300866.html\">Bower &amp; Wilkins</a> or <a href=\"https://howl.link/1nmye4atlzziq\">Best Buy</a> for $318.99 ($80 off). The British audio brand isn’t as well-known as Sony or Bose, though with the S2E, you’re getting superb sound, superior build quality, and controls that rely on physical buttons as opposed to the tap/swipe gestures found on mainstream noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s XM5.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23187234/bowers-wilkins-px7-s2-noise-canceling-headphones-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anker’s Soundcore Sport X20 earbuds</strong>&nbsp;are on sale at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-True-Wireless-Extendable-Cancelling-Waterproof/dp/B0CRT6HQ82/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howl.link/v279y814pr78e\">Best Buy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/soundcore-Sport-X20-Anker-True-Wireless-Workout-Earbuds-Rotatable-Extendable-Ear-Hooks-Noise-Cancelling-Deep-Bass-IP68-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Dustproo/5344496056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Walmart</a>&nbsp;for $63.99 ($16 off), matching their second-best price to date. The fitness-friendly buds are a lot like the Sport X10 — which were once our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23413809/best-workout-fitness-running-earbuds\">favorite budget earbuds for the gym</a>&nbsp;— only they offer longer battery life, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and multipoint support. They also supposedly offer better noise cancellation and continue to sport an adjustable ear hook, which is a boon if you’re someone who struggles with keeping traditional earbuds in during intense gym sessions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"portable-charger-and-cable-deals\">Portable charger and cable deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Power banks with built-in USB-C cables are the hot thing right now. As it turns out, having a battery pack that can charge your device in a jiffy and double as a lanyard is pretty great. Luckily, you can snag one of the most affordable 20,000mAh models out there, <strong>Anker’s 30W Zolo</strong> <strong>power bank</strong>, for $24.61 (about $11 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9LH53B?th=1\">Amazon</a>. While it’s not powerful enough to quickly charge a Steam Deck that’s running games, it’ll do just fine for charging it (as well as other USB-C devices) while they sleep.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re someone who owns (or, someday, envisions owning) USB-C gadgets that draw a lot of power, it’s wise to buy cables with high wattage passthrough, just so you’re ready for the future. <strong>Anker’s six-foot 240W USB-C cable</strong> is a great candidate, especially since it’s discounted to $16.99 ($8 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ43567W?th=1\">Amazon</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ugreen’s Uno lineup of charging accessories aims to be more personable. To that end, its <strong>6.6-foot 1ooW USB-C cable</strong> — which is currently discounted to $10.39 ($2.61 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7B719XQ?th=1\">Amazon</a> — has expressive, Tamagotchi-like eyes. The reason?

Unlike the newer Qi2 offerings that provide 15W charging speeds, Ugreen’s charger can only supply 7.5W of power to MagSafe-compatible devices, or 5W to a pair of wireless earbuds or any Qi-ready device if you’re using the integrated charging stand located on the bottom.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you need a cheap way to charge your gadgets, <strong>Anker’s 30W Nano Charger</strong> is matching its all-time low of $12.99 ($3 off) in select colors at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2MM1W65/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anker.com/products/a2147\">Anker’s online storefront</a> (with code <strong>WS7DV29VBNV2</strong>). The single-port USB-C offering doesn’t include a charging cable; however, it does come in a few fun colors and sports a set of folding prongs that allow you to stow it just about anywhere.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"speaker-and-soundbar-deals\">Speaker and soundbar deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>JBL’s Charge 5</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X4YMTPM/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/4n2yt706cfa0w\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Charge-5-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Powerbank-Black/625340678\">Walmart</a> in multiple colors starting at $119.95 ($60 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker since July. We’re not huge fans of the oversized JBL logo, but the powerful Bluetooth speaker hits all the right marks when it comes to functionality and performance, offering an impressive 20 hours of battery life and a built-in USB-A port that lets you top off your phone while listening to music.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Despite the fact the Sonos app has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/630883/sonos-update-new-features-future-updates\">been a bit of a debacle</a> as of late, I have few qualms about recommending the <strong>Sonos Era 100</strong> for around $199 ($50 off), its current price at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW34LCB8/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/0o6r720ug5qld\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/era-100-black/\">Sonos’ online storefront</a>.

The modern, easy-to-use thermostat allows for easy control of your HVAC even while you’re not home and supports Alexa “hunches” to try and predict what changes you need based on your habits, which could help you save on your monthly bill. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Amazon’s Smart Air Quality Monitor</strong>&nbsp;is on sale for $54.99 ($15 off) at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Smart-Quality-Monitor/dp/B08W8KS8D3\">Amazon</a>, which is $10 shy of its best price yet.

The 2023 model sports USB-C charging, a 10.1-inch, 1080p display, and 3GB of RAM, which is plenty if all you’re doing is streaming or browsing.

Although not originally priced as such, it’s considered an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23691498/best-garmin-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-wearables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entry-level fitness watch for Garmin fans</a>. It’s pretty stylish, overall, and can last just as long and do just as much as a Fitbit (if not more). We also like it for its wide breadth of health and workout-tracking features, along with its support for built-in GPS and contactless payments. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23500640/garmin-venu-sq-2-review-smartwatch-fitness-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read our full review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"other-verge-favorites\">Other <em>Verge</em> favorites</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Blue Yeti microphone</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY6Z2M6/\">Amazon</a> in a myriad of colors starting at $89.99 ($40 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One of our go-to gift guide picks, the <strong>Instant Pot Duo Plus</strong>, is currently available for an all-time low of $89.95 ($40 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBKTPTS\">Amazon</a>. Multiple <em>Verge</em> staffers swear by the six-quart multi-cooker, which is similar to the base-model instant pot but comes with a few additional smart programs, including a customizable sous vide setting and a cake option that lets you pressure cook at high temperature for 40 minutes. That’s in addition to the ability to cook rice, steam veggies, and sauté, among other actions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Govee may be best known for its ambient TV backlighting, but it also makes lighting products to illuminate your entire living space in shades of RGB. One of its most stunning lights, the <strong>Smart Table Lamp 2</strong>, is on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D41XL87F\">Amazon</a>. It can provide vibrant lights for a gathering, or you can adjust its color temperature to suit your bedtime and wake-up rituals better.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Having access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed. If you’ll be out in the wild, or if you’re vacationing but want to be cautious when it comes to water intake, the <strong>LifeStraw Peak</strong> is worth picking up at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SBPWHS7/\">Amazon</a> for its current price of $18.62 ($6 off). It’s essentially a thick straw outfitted with a filter that’s capable of removing 99.9 percent of bacteria, parasites, and microplastics from the water you’re drinking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cagiwiru’s Cordless Air Blower / Duster</strong>&nbsp;is down to an all-time low of $18.04 ($7 off) at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CAGIWIRU-Compressed-Cordless-LED-Light-no-dusters-car/dp/B0CCD7KPM6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a> (at checkout). It might not be as powerful as a can of compressed air, but it’s close, and it’s much more versatile with its swappable tips, built-in light, and ability to recharge via USB-C.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>AeroPress Go </strong>is nearly matching its best price to date at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Portable-Travel-Coffee-Press/dp/B07YVL8SF3/\">Amazon</a>, where you can pick it up for $31.95 ($18 off). It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst <em>Verge </em>staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the <strong>ChomChom Roller</strong>, especially since it&#8217;s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BAGTNAQ\">Amazon</a> for $19.59 ($5 off). This simple tool can de-fur your couch faster and more effectively than most vacuums, even if it’s not the best tool for ridding clothes of unwanted hair.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We like Hoto’s svelte toolkits for a couple of reasons. They strike a minimalistic look, for one thing, and they incorporate at least one power tool. The company’s <strong>Drill Tool Set</strong> — which is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YTNLDJG\">Amazon</a> for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wildfire season might be a ways off, but if you’d like to get ahead, you can pick up <strong>Coway’s Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty </strong>from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coway-AP-1512HH-Mighty-Purifier-True/dp/B00BTKAPUU/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://cowaymega.com/products/mighty-ap-1512hh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Coway</a> for $165 ($75 off), which nearly matches its second-best price to date. The compact HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system, and though we don’t do a ton of dedicated air purifier testing here at <em>The Verge</em>, we can personally attest to the effectiveness of this midrange model for smaller rooms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, March 29th:</strong> Updated to reflect current pricing/availability and several new deals, including discounts on SwitchBot’s Smart Switch Button Pusher and the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They’ve warned that the efforts to wind down the agency have already left many consumers without sufficient recourse for their complaints about financial services. In recent years, the CFPB has increasingly become a check on the technology industry as tech companies grew into the financial services space. (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/599137/x-money-payments-service-2025-launch\">For example, Elon Musk’s X purports to eventually become a payments service.)</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as DOGE got involved at the agency, according to reporting and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/628327/cfpb-nteu-vought-shut-down\">testimony presented before the judge</a>, the CFPB <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy/612933/cfpb-tech-team-gutted-trump-doge-elon-muskhttps://www.theverge.com/policy/612933/cfpb-tech-team-gutted-trump-doge-elon-musk\">terminated technologists</a> —&nbsp;who would, obviously, be necessary staff when regulating tech companies —&nbsp;and placed much of its workforce on administrative leave. After CFPB Acting Director Russell Vought told agency staff on February 10th to “stand down from performing any work task,” workers testified they followed that order literally. Allegedly, this surprised the administration, with one official later clarifying that statutorily mandated work should still get done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The judge says she was “left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything,” saying that the government’s arguments that CFPB workers were back to work have “been shown to be unreliable and inconsistent with the agency’s own contemporaneous records.” She also condemned an “eleventh hour attempt to suggest immediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jackson opens her opinion with quotes from Musk (the public face of DOGE), Vought, and President Donald Trump about their alleged intentions to eliminate the agency. For instance, Musk tweeted “CFPB RIP” on February 7th. “The CFPB has been a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,” Vought said the following day. A couple days later, Trump added, “That was a very important thing to get rid of.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Essentially, the CFPB can — for now — get back to work</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jackson came to the conclusion that unless she takes action, “the RIF [reduction-in-force] notices that have already been prepared will go out before the ink is dry on the Court’s signature, the employees will be back on administrative leave for just thirty days before they are gone, and the defendants will pull the plug on the CFPB.” While this isn’t a final ruling, as part of issuing the injunction, Jackson says the workers’ union is likely to ultimately succeed in court on its claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The judge <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69624423/88/national-treasury-employees-union-v-vought/\">orders</a> the Trump administration to reinstate all probationary and term employees terminated since February 10th, carry out no further terminations without cause or issue any RIF notice, lift the administrative leave requirements and stop-work order, and let employees either return to an office or work remotely. She also requires that the government maintain CFPB data and records, and rescind contract termination notices sent since February 11th. Essentially, the CFPB can — for now — get back to work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Workers are cautiously celebrating. “While we are thrilled and relieved at today’s outcome, union members are under no illusion that this is the end of Trump’s lawless attacks,” CFPB Union President Cat Farman says in a statement. “Vought has already violated previous court orders by deleting data and failing to reinstate illegally fired workers. We can&#8217;t rely on judges alone to keep wannabe dictators in check. We need everyone to join the fight to save our services, unionize our workplaces, and create more good middle class jobs doing vital work that benefits working people instead of billionaires and Wall Street.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
    "summary": "A court took action on Friday to keep the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from shutting down a consumer watchdog agency while its court case plays out.

Most afternoons are spent roller skating, scooting on scooters, playing hide-and-seek, throwing a ball, and just getting old, good, and dirty. </span></p><p><span>There&#39;s something magical about watching them engage in simple, unstructured play.</span></p><h2 id=\"a7c479e6-ac87-444a-86c2-6da7bc949cfe\" data-toc-id=\"a7c479e6-ac87-444a-86c2-6da7bc949cfe\"><span>They are learning to resolve conflicts without adults</span></h2><p><span>Recently, the kids discovered </span><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-broke-up-with-boyfriend-after-he-let-cat-out-2022-11\"><span>a neighborhood cat</span></a><span> and immediately took it upon themselves to care for it. They brought the cat water, laid out a blanket, and even built a little enclosed area using a baseball net and soccer net to make the cat feel at home. They asked us to contact neighbors to see who the cat belonged to so it could go home to its rightful owner after they were done nurturing the kitty. Their kindness and teamwork in this small act demonstrated the values they are learning through play &mdash; empathy, problem-solving, and cooperation.</span></p><p><span>One of the most inspiring aspects of their playtime is how they </span><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-how-to-defuse-conflicts-communication-at-work-advice-2022-4\"><span>resolve conflicts</span></a><span> over what to do. With five unique personalities, disagreements naturally arise. One child may want to host a frontyard fashion show, while another prefers a game of catch. These differences sometimes lead to arguments among the children; however, these disagreements help them learn to take turns, make compromises, and give everyone an opportunity to enjoy their preferred activity. </span></p><p><span>Their ability to negotiate and collaborate without adult intervention (most of the time) is a testament to the social skills they are developing through these outdoor adventures.</span></p><h2 id=\"cbeaa4c3-c3b1-43d9-bf25-64c98eefa7f6\" data-toc-id=\"cbeaa4c3-c3b1-43d9-bf25-64c98eefa7f6\"><span>They get limited and monitored screen time</span></h2><p><span>On spring 2024, my husband, my two next-door neighbors, and I began having organic conversations about parenting and technology on our front lawns. Already noticing screen time&#39;s negative effects on our children, we all decided to read Jonathan Haidt&#39;s &#34;The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.&#34; </span></p><p><span>The book, which explores how technology has contributed to a mental health crisis among children raised on digital devices, has many great takeaways. One of the book&#39;s core messages that truly resonated with all of us is that the decline of free play and the increase in screen time have severely harmed children&#39;s social and emotional development.</span></p><p><span>As millennials, we remember being children who could play outside with neighbors with little to no adult supervision, making up games, playing tag, and generally working on our social skills with our peers. The book suggests that kids need more unsupervised play to develop independence, problem-solving skills, and social competence.</span></p><h2 id=\"0c5bf0d1-a2bc-49c3-b86b-9b57b2032a5b\" data-toc-id=\"0c5bf0d1-a2bc-49c3-b86b-9b57b2032a5b\"><span>We want our kids to have the childhood we had</span></h2><p><span>We all agreed that we want our children to grow up experiencing life outside, playing with neighbors the way we did  &mdash; running, exploring, making mistakes, and learning to navigate conflicts together. It&#39;s about giving them the space to figure things out with one another rather than being absorbed by screens. Don&#39;t get me wrong, our children still get screen time, but it&#39;s limited and monitored. </span></p><p><span>Other neighbors often stroll by, smiling as they reminisce about a time when front-yard play was the norm. Every now and then, other neighborhood kids join in, turning our little patch of grass into a lively, impromptu playdate filled with laughter, negotiation, and the kind of childhood moments we all cherish.</span></p><p><span>In a world where children are often glued to tablets and video games, and the art of face-to-face interaction is fading, I feel incredibly fortunate that our little group of front-yard friends is embracing the kind of carefree, outdoor play that defined so many of our &#39;90s childhoods. </span></p><p><span>Watching them play outside almost every day is a reminder that the best childhood moments are often the simplest ones.</span></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/raising-kids-with-nineties-type-childhood-free-range-parenting-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

It&#39;s becoming even more difficult now that the cost of living is rising.</p><p>It&#39;s so damn defeating.</p><h2 id=\"f6dc4521-025c-4b8e-890a-c6a49220161e\" data-toc-id=\"f6dc4521-025c-4b8e-890a-c6a49220161e\"><strong>I feel like I&#39;m failing as a mother</strong></h2><p>At 46, I thought I would have made it by now &mdash; whatever that means. I thought I would have some financial cushion, a liveable salary, or a husband to ease the financial burden. I have none of that. I&#39;m ashamed I have zero credit cards, savings, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/can-you-pay-rent-with-a-credit-card\">retirement plans</a>.</p><p>Instead, all I have is worry. My <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-financial-planner-young-people-anxious-about-money-2024-10\">money anxiety</a> is stealing precious moments from under my nose. My kids come home from school with stories and smiles, and I nod<em>,</em> but I&#39;m not really there. I&#39;m in my head, where the wheels are turning, trying to figure out which bills to pay this month and which to put off, hoping that my bank will reverse that overdraft charge and praying that my landlord will accept the late rent again.</p><p>I wake up every day and strive not to let money (or lack thereof) define me, but every day I fail. I battle with thoughts of inadequacy and guilt and shame because I can&#39;t provide for my kids in the ways I know they deserve.</p><p>We all deserve more. I need a root canal, and the tooth is starting to hurt, but my current <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/health-insurance-struggle-uhc-denied-claims-self-employed-2024-12\">health insurance</a> won&#39;t cover it, so I am just trying to deal with it until I get new insurance, stumble upon an extra $600, or have the damn tooth pulled altogether. My daughter needs a prom dress; my son has grown three inches and needs an entirely new wardrobe. Anyone who has kids knows that each day brings with it new, unexpected expenses: field trip fees, coaches&#39; gifts, and school projects that require things like a new white T-shirt, poster board, and markers.</p><p>Thankfully, the kids spend half the time with their father, who covers most of their expenses. But it leaves me feeling ashamed and guilty.</p><h2 id=\"9b0f12d3-3852-4da3-b2f7-417671005ab4\" data-toc-id=\"9b0f12d3-3852-4da3-b2f7-417671005ab4\"><strong>I envy other families who don&#39;t have to deal with money issues</strong></h2><p>As I stroll up and down the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-save-money-groceries-food-bank-shop-aldi-tiktok-advice-2025-3\">grocery aisles</a>, I add the items in my cart to be sure their sum total isn&#39;t more than my bank balance. We&#39;ve recently had to cut back significantly on groceries because of the rising prices.</p><p>I also look at the other moms and dads: Their overflowing carts, the smiles on their faces, and the Airpods in their ears tell me they probably aren&#39;t calculating anything. It makes me frustrated and sad that we have to live like this while they don&#39;t have these worries.</p><p>I try to convince myself that life isn&#39;t about material things, like dinners at nice restaurants, new comfortable shoes, or grocery carts overflowing with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-men-luxury-items-cant-live-without-must-have-2024-12\">luxury items</a> like ice cream and shrimp.</p><h2 id=\"5fff9b19-479c-4c61-b458-d925911143b5\" data-toc-id=\"5fff9b19-479c-4c61-b458-d925911143b5\"><strong>Still, there is happiness, and I hold onto that</strong></h2><p>Recently, I overheard my son say to his sister: &#34;Moms are magical, aren&#39;t they?&#34;</p><p>Moments like that make me believe I can do anything and get us through all of these difficulties.</p><p>I remind myself that we are blessed with a roof over our heads, food on the table, and health. These are the times when I know we are rich in important ways.</p><p>I also knew this on the Uber Eats deliveries with my son. To him, it was an adventure and an opportunity to earn something he desperately wanted. As it turns out, it was an opportunity for us to enjoy the things we <em>do</em> have that money truly can&#39;t buy: laughter, health, and love.</p><p>We were broke but happy for those three Uber Eats deliveries &mdash; and we laughed the whole time. It just so happens that Chipotle tastes even better when it&#39;s hard-earned.</p><p>Maybe my tomorrows are filled with a different story and the comfort of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-gen-z-want-workplace-financial-stability-paid-leave-2024-2\">financial stability</a> &mdash; or maybe my wealth comes in the form of health and love.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/single-mom-stress-poverty-money-anixety-unbearable-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

We&#39;d lived in Melbourne for eight years and were ready for a change.</span></p><p><span>One night in October 2021, my husband put an idea on the table. He asked if I wanted to turn over a new leaf and move to Bright, where his family was based. We&#39;d already vacationed there plenty of times, and I&#39;d enjoyed it, so I said, &#34;Sure, let&#39;s do it.&#34; Soon, we were planning our escape from Melbourne.</span></p><h2 id=\"57339dd2-1c24-4b5e-9a1e-aa03511454a2\" data-toc-id=\"57339dd2-1c24-4b5e-9a1e-aa03511454a2\"><span>We decided not to sell our home in Melbourne when we moved</span></h2><p><span>We&#39;d been living in the </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/unmarried-couples-buying-house-lawyer-advice-split-2023-9\"><span>home we&#39;d bought together</span></a><span> for four years, and though we were ready to leave Melbourne, I had reservations about selling. We also didn&#39;t want to buy in Bright because I didn&#39;t know whether I&#39;d enjoy living in such a small town. I suggested we spend a year there and then reassess after that.</span></p><p><span>The first major hurdle we faced was finding a place to live. Though small, Bright is a popular tourist destination known for its wineries, hiking, and gold rush history. It&#39;s surrounded by beautiful mountains and is a short drive from Mount Hotham, a popular ski resort. Rental properties in the area are in short supply, but we were lucky enough to find accommodation at a friend&#39;s place while they were overseas for the year. We relocated at the end of January 2022 and rented out our home in Melbourne to tenants.</span></p><p><span>Our family quickly fell in love with the slower pace of country life. Later that year, in August, we </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-third-child-kid-can-change-family-unexpected-ways-2025-1\"><span>welcomed our third child</span></a><span> to the family.</span></p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e5492263d72727e1986262?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"The author&#39;s three kids sitting on the lawn in a park.\"/><figcaption>Not long after moving to Bright, the author and her husband had a third child.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Melissa Noble</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"c6be1674-a795-4e9a-9058-fd86820cb8c7\" data-toc-id=\"c6be1674-a795-4e9a-9058-fd86820cb8c7\"><span>Renting in Bright means we have more flexibility</span></h2><p><span>As a growing family, we needed our own space, so in January 2023, we moved into a simple three-bedroom house conveniently close to town. Then, last October, we found our current rental home &mdash; a beautiful three-bedroom, two-bath property in a green, family-friendly part of Bright.</span></p><p><span>My favorite thing about the property is the big back garden. Birds love it, too, and pink galahs and crimson rosellas visit every day. There are three small vegetable plots where we grow tomatoes and strawberries, and my </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/unsupervised-play-outdoors-kids-neighborhood-benefits-2024-5\"><span>children spend hours outdoors</span></a><span> in nature.</span></p><p><span>Financially, renting where we want to live and owning a property elsewhere has been a good decision.

Bright is much more expensive than Melbourne, and the median house price is over $1 million. We get to live here while </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/i-paid-my-mortgage-off-early-sometimes-i-regret-it-2025-2\"><span>paying off our mortgage</span></a><span> in Melbourne, and that&#39;s a big drawcard.</span></p><h2 id=\"93024cfd-0dfc-4b8b-b0e8-9680abe1dac8\" data-toc-id=\"93024cfd-0dfc-4b8b-b0e8-9680abe1dac8\"><span>We might not rent forever, but it works for us for now</span></h2><p><span>Sometimes, my husband feels guilty about the kids not having a &#34;proper&#34; family home. They&#39;ve never owned a pet because it&#39;s easier to get a rental property without one, and that makes me sad.

I explain to everyone and it blows their mind to learn that sweet brown mushrooms &mdash; those little cap mushrooms you see at the store &mdash; and portobellos are the same mushrooms. They&#39;re the same <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-you-cant-overcook-mushrooms-2016-6\">fungi</a>, but portobellos are harvested just two days later than the little ones.

That&#39;s not very long, so we&#39;re not waiting 190 days to harvest something like other plants. They also require minimal resources, like water. They don&#39;t need sunlight to synthesize because they&#39;re not plants, and they can thrive in really small spaces. Not to mention, they&#39;re very resilient, and they&#39;re really good at surviving different changes in their environment.</p><p>And they&#39;re entirely edible. You can consume the whole mushroom so there&#39;s no waste. So let&#39;s say you <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/started-home-garden-no-experience-save-money-on-groceries-2025-2\">grow tomatoes</a>, you don&#39;t eat the whole plant so there&#39;s plant waste, and you&#39;ve got to figure out what to do with that. The beauty of mushrooms is that when they decompose, you can reuse the inevitable plant waste as part of the substrate needed for them to grow, so they help close that loop in agriculture. If you&#39;ve ever gone to a nursery and got mushroom compost that&#39;s treated with mushroom substrate, you know it is really <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/mushroom-benefits\">nutrient-rich</a>, and it&#39;s great for growing more plants.</p><p>But most importantly, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-reduction-in-force-plans-department-closures-doge-firings-trump-2025-3\">NASA</a> prioritizes whole foods over supplements, because there&#39;s a benefit to eating whole foods. In nutrition science, you know that when you start supplementing, it&#39;s not the same effect in the body as nature intended with the combination of nutrients. So fungi are a whole food source of very high nutrition; they&#39;ve got nutrients found across our food groups, from grains to vegetables to nuts and seeds to fish and meat.</p><p>Astronauts are given 1000 IUs of vitamin D daily to maintain bone health, and mushrooms can naturally produce vitamin D when they&#39;re exposed to UV light, just like humans can. So basically, we can get 100% of our vitamin D requirements with just 100 grams of mushrooms.</p><p>There&#39;s also research showing that when you add mushrooms to a meal, you can add less salt, which is really important because, in space, having too much sodium exacerbates the amount of calcium that&#39;s leached from the bone. So it&#39;s a counter-measure to have a lower-sodium diet.</p><p>And if all that weren&#39;t enough, what&#39;s <em>really</em> cool about mushrooms is that they&#39;re very rich in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/kitchen/umami\">umami</a>. That&#39;s the fifth basic taste, like sour, sweet, salty, or bitter &mdash; and, unlike the other flavors, umami seems to be well retained in a space environment.</p><p>It&#39;s just like an airplane. Have you ever ordered a wine on a flight and then tried the same one after landing? It tastes different. Everything is dampened. It&#39;s the lower humidity and higher cabin pressures that change the palatability. Not with mushrooms, you still get that umami flavor.</p><p>That&#39;s where it gets particularly interesting for long-haul space flights, like the kind we&#39;ll need to take to get to Mars. Can you imagine eating thermostabilized, dehydrated food for five years? I can&#39;t.</p><p>The most important thing about food is nutrition, sure, but food is so much more than that. It&#39;s a fundamental part of our culture and survival and mental health. At the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/astronauts-best-photos-from-space-station-this-year-2024-12\">International Space Station</a>, the astronauts love coming together at the dinner meal and eating and exchanging food. It&#39;s nostalgic, but it&#39;s also a comfort. They&#39;re isolated, they&#39;re far away from home. So food becomes a way to connect with each other, but also to connect with their culture, their family, and the things they love.</p><p>So, that&#39;s why we are looking at space crops.</p><p>This month, my company is partnering with NASA and SpaceX to complete the first study to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/permafungi-mushrooms-used-coffee-grounds-recycling-2020-8\">grow mushrooms</a> in space. If it all goes according to plan, I think we may have just unlocked a key element of long-haul space travel, the kind of thing that will help us reach Mars.</p><p>On March 31, on a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-history-biggest-moments-elon-musk-2022-12\">SpaceX</a> Fram2 flight departing out of Florida, we&#39;re sending our mushroom experiment to space to see how they grow. The flight is three and a half days, and since they basically double in size every day, we&#39;re hopeful we&#39;ll see something promising. Since we&#39;re not sending them up to the ISS and waiting months to get them back, we&#39;ll actually get results relatively quickly, and we hope to publish our results this fall.</p><p>My daughter will be with me on launch day. When I started talking about sending mushrooms to space a couple of years ago, I would have never imagined I&#39;d get here. I&#39;m just so proud to show her that when you&#39;ve got a dream, you just have to keep going and you can use your passion to help us get to a new frontier.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/space-nutritionist-mushrooms-superfood-nasa-study-spacex-mars-travel-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Talk of efficiency and intensity has replaced perks and pampering. Rolling layoffs have become the norm. Management layers are thinning. AI can help companies do more with less.</p><p>Now, at least at Google, some employees aren&#39;t pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they&#39;re speaking out about it.</p><p>Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-smaller-pay-bumps-recent-all-hands-2025-3\">an exclusive report</a> from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp.</p><p>A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets.</p><p>But the story got me thinking about how Google&#39;s lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google.</p><p><strong><em>Steve: </em>What&#39;s the reaction to your scoop?</strong></p><p><em>Hugh: </em>Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a &#34;world&#39;s smallest violin&#34; feeling to them &mdash; Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters.</p><p><strong>What impact do you see this having on Google&#39;s workforce?</strong></p><p>The fact it got raised during the company&#39;s all-hands means it&#39;s on a lot of employees&#39; minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest.</p><p><strong>As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend?</strong></p><p>Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it&#39;s doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we&#39;ve seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It&#39;s also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-company-cut-manager-vp-roles-2024-12\">chopped away at management layers</a> and in some cases set a higher bar for performance.</p><p>Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there&#39;s a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over.</p><hr/><h2 id=\"8de1f093-db58-438e-a296-ab09ff92ad5c\" data-toc-id=\"8de1f093-db58-438e-a296-ab09ff92ad5c\"><strong>Tesla&#39;s tipping point</strong></h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e291dbb8b41a9673fb9a2e?format=jpeg\" height=\"240\" width=\"480\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Car on a tipping point.\"/><figcaption><p class=\"copyright\">MANDEL NGAN/Getty, _iceman/Getty, Ava Horton/BI</p></figcaption></figure><p>Many assumed Elon Musk&#39;s proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive &mdash; but the opposite has proven to be true.

I&#39;m more patient and present, and my daughters are thriving.</p><p id=\"bd21e451-4be6-47f3-8ea6-0a3998696995\">Everywhere we go &mdash; restaurants, parks, shopping centers &mdash; there&#39;s a built-in understanding that children are the community&#39;s responsibility.</p><p id=\"bd21e451-4be6-47f3-8ea6-0a3998696995\">My youngest, once hesitant to join group activities, now confidently introduces herself to new children at the park. My oldest has developed remarkable independence, navigating social situations with ease.</p><p id=\"bd21e451-4be6-47f3-8ea6-0a3998696995\">My husband is also enjoying more time with the kids. For example, when our daughter had her first football tournament &mdash; an hour&#39;s drive away during a workday &mdash; he simply told his boss he needed to leave at noon. &#34;Of course,&#34; was the response. No guilt or subtle expectation to make up the time.</p><p id=\"bd21e451-4be6-47f3-8ea6-0a3998696995\">I also find myself working fewer hours without sacrificing my business or work quality. For instance, I closed my laptop at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday for a spontaneous beach trip &mdash; something I&#39;d never have done before without feeling guilty.</p><p id=\"bd21e451-4be6-47f3-8ea6-0a3998696995\">I&#39;ve also stopped feeling guilty when my kids have unscheduled time. Back home, I&#39;d worry if they weren&#39;t in enrichment classes or organized sports every afternoon. Now, I see the value in letting them build forts in the living room or spend an hour just drawing.</p><p>Our family has grown closer in tangible ways. We eat meals together without devices, go on weekend adventures without work interruptions, and have conversations that aren&#39;t rushed by the next commitment.</p><p><em>Sonaya Williams has lived with her family in the UK, Denmark, and Qatar.

The following has been edited for length and clarity.</em></span></p><p><span>I was really fortunate to have amazing role models in my life, and I&#39;m very intentional about being a role model for my kids.</span></p><p><span>I joined Merrill Lynch in 2013. I provide wealth management advice to our clients, who include business owners, professional athletes, doctors, and lawyers.</span></p><p><span>At my job, I&#39;ve focused a lot on educating the next generation about finances. It&#39;s given me a cheat code for dealing with my own kids, who are six and four.</span></p><p><span>Here are some of the key ways I&#39;ve decided to teach my kids about financial literacy and how I&#39;m planning ahead to set them up for financial success.</span></p><h2 id=\"a20c6e32-544c-404e-bef3-766918ee4d53\" data-toc-id=\"a20c6e32-544c-404e-bef3-766918ee4d53\"><span><strong>Encouraging charitable giving</strong></span></h2><p><span>I don&#39;t think my children are too young to learn about gratitude, compassion, and appreciation. If we start those habits early, they will stay with them for the rest of their lives.</span></p><p><span>My kids save money in piggy banks for charitable giving. When they&#39;ve accumulated enough funds, they&#39;ll choose, with a little guidance, where to donate those funds. At four and six, my wife and I want our kids to focus on saving for charities and helping the less fortunate.</span></p><p><span>When my six year old turns seven and starts first grade, I&#39;ll introduce him to investing and we will explore what stocks he would want to create his first portfolio.</span></p><p><span>My kids have a head start in life with two loving parents with good jobs. We&#39;ve already started putting money away for college.  I want to teach them that once a family has <em>&#34;</em>enough&#34; it is crucial to give back.</span></p><h2 id=\"5afcd3ca-2981-4f52-94c6-27f7f0ce988d\" data-toc-id=\"5afcd3ca-2981-4f52-94c6-27f7f0ce988d\"><span><strong>Letting them try out investing</strong></span></h2><p><span>My dad worked in finance and would cut articles out of the Wall Street Journal for me to read. He treated me like his &#34;junior partner&#34; and talked to me about business decisions he made at work.</span></p><p><span>When I got birthday money as a kid, I told my dad I wanted to invest it. He let me and this spurred my interest in the market. I saw the power of making a good investment.</span></p><p><span>I&#39;m planning to introduce my oldest child to investing soon. I want him to use his money to pick some companies to invest in, so he can feel the impact of decisions he makes. Nowadays, it&#39;s relatively easy to open a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) account and let my children pick some stocks.</span></p><p><span>I do a lot of investment coaching with the children of our clients. Once, a 12-year-old visited our office. We pulled the research reports for companies he&#39;d picked and discussed what can indicate an advisable or ill-advised investment.  By pulling research reports of companies he selected, the child felt heard and respected.</span></p><p><span>The child learned financial terms associated with stock research, so next time he wants to do some digging, jargon will not be a barrier to entry. I absolutely intend to do this with my children.</span></p><p><span>It&#39;s not about getting kids to have amazing returns. It&#39;s about getting them engaged. If they invest for long enough, they can also see the power of compounding. Time in the market beats timing the market.</span></p><h2 id=\"bbeefc78-4a29-4f93-a805-befe1bd9e6b9\" data-toc-id=\"bbeefc78-4a29-4f93-a805-befe1bd9e6b9\"><span><strong>Teaching them the value of hard work</strong></span></h2><p><span>I once asked my parents for a video game system, and my mom told me she wouldn&#39;t pay for it.</span></p><p><span>I ended up working in a friend of my dad&#39;s factory doing simple jobs like packing boxes. Soon, I had enough money to buy myself the game system.</span></p><p><span>I won&#39;t have my kids working in factories, but they do know that their parents value hard work. </span></p><p><span>Sometimes, my children will ask why my wife or I have to work late. We let them know that we strive to provide a good life for the family and that we work hard to earn money to pay for food, our home, and their education. </span>I want them to know that nothing is guaranteed in life.</p><p><span>I intend to pay them for chores. It could be as simple as making their beds. That&#39;s not a high-value item, but it&#39;s worth something to me if my wife and I don&#39;t have to do it.</span></p><h2 id=\"91fbd6eb-5bcb-4b61-972e-73dcf56ba7cf\" data-toc-id=\"91fbd6eb-5bcb-4b61-972e-73dcf56ba7cf\"><span><strong>Saving for their future</strong></span></h2><p><span>One of my financial goals is to send both of my kids to college debt-free, so I set up a </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investing/best-529-plans\"><span>529 plan</span></a><span> as soon as they had Social Security numbers. A 529 is a tax-advantaged education investment account that can help a child to attend college without incurring debt.</span></p><p><span>Each child has their own 529. This is important because my children are of different ages and </span>I&#39;ll invest in their 529s in line with when they go to college<span>. As we get closer to college, we&#39;ll lessen the risk level because the money will need to be spent sooner.</span></p><p><span>I also want to accumulate enough wealth to give my children choices in life. If one wants to work in finance or tech, they may not need help from my wife and me. But if one of them wants to become a social worker, the financial rewards might look a little different.</span></p><p><span>I don&#39;t want my kids to be held back from doing amazing work in the community for financial reasons. We want to support them so they can make that choice without worrying about the salary difference. </span></p><p><span>Several families I have counseled help subsidize a child who worked diligently in a less lucrative career, and this is something I admired.</span></p><p><span>We&#39;re planning for this by setting money aside and only buying what we need. We can afford to buy more luxury goods than we do, and that&#39;s by design.</span></p><p><span>I&#39;ll probably tell my kids that we&#39;ve got this money set aside for them when they&#39;re around college age. I don&#39;t want to tell them too early as I wouldn&#39;t want them to rely on it.</span></p><p><span><em>Do you have a story to share about planning for your children&#39;s financial future?

It includes a new human-centric version of Apple&#39;s App Store for Mini Apps.

The program will distribute the equivalent of $300,000, paid in WLD tokens &mdash; World&#39;s native digital currency, which converts to $0.85 per token &mdash; on a monthly basis to qualifying app developers over a three-month pilot period.</p><p>The pilot program follows the launch of &#34;World Build,&#34; an incubator program World introduced in January created in partnership with Friend with Benefits, a social network for crypto&#39;s creative set, web3 platform Alchemy, and crypto-focused investment funds Bain Capital Crypto, Blockchain Capital, and Variant Fund.</p><p>The program, which runs from February through May, will include hackathons and retreats, and end with a demo day with investors in New York.</p><p>One of these developers, Diego Estevez, 24, built a Mini App called Credit that offers instant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-when-considering-a-microfinance-loan-2010-5\">microcredit</a> to World users in Argentina. The app does not<strong> </strong>rely on credit scores, collateral, or income verification to give people loans, which start as low as $5, and are capped at $100.</p><p>&#34;As  they repay, they get to access increasingly larger loans,&#34; Estevez told BI. &#34; The progression of loans is structured in such a way that you cannot repay a small loan to then default on a greater loan.&#34;</p><p>In essence, there&#39;s no way to game<strong> </strong>Estevez&#39;s system to earn quick money.</p><p>Estevez said that close to 100,000 users have downloaded and opened the app since it launched and 15,000 loans have been issued. While Credit is anonymous and doesn&#39;t track how users spend the money, Estevez believes they&#39;re using it for everyday necessities like groceries, transportation, and medicine. He said he knows users have become dependent on it given the onslaught of messages he receives whenever the app goes down.</p><p>The sudden success of Credit is a reflection of the realities of the developing world where many people have access to the internet and phone, but no meaningful way to obtain credit. It may also reveal what drives an app ecosystem built on human necessity rather than profit, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-see-your-apple-app-store-purchase-history-2018-7\">Apple&#39;s App Store</a>.</p><p>World aims to grow its network through initiatives like Mini Apps. The millions already using them create &#34; a virtuous cycle where you can now do more things on the network, and because of that more people join,&#34; Tiago Sada, the chief product officer for Tools for Humanity, the company building Word&#39;s technology, told Business Insider. He noted that Mini Apps have already begun to garner attention from investors.</p><p>World&#39;s first goal  is to get to 1 billion users. From there it&#39;ll focus on 10 billion, Sada said. Every human may not end up on World, but Sada said the network&#39;s goal is to ensure that everyone at least has the opportunity to register.</p><p>World has had its share of struggles. It has butted heads with regulators in countries including Kenya, Spain, and South Korea for its use of biometric data. It&#39;s also faced criticism for luring users in developing countries desperate for the WLD grants they receive after signing up.</p><p>&#34;To date, the novel technology underpinning World has enabled nearly 12M individuals to securely and anonymously prove their humanness online and to participate in the global digital economy,&#34; a representative for World wrote to BI by email. &#34;Big change is never easy (esp for governments), but we&#39;re working through the challenges and will keep building.&#34;</p><p>Sada sees it as the only solution to the AI boom&#39;s existential crisis.</p><p>&#34; We sometimes refer to World as the freedom stack,&#34; he said. It&#39;s anonymous, self-custodial, and lives on users&#39; phones because &#34;we want to live in a world where people are more free than they are today.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altmans-world-app-store-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Another popular strategy is flipping properties.</p><p>However, there are multiple ways to invest in real estate.</p><p>Business Insider has spoken with investors who are using less traditional strategies to hit financial independence. Here are three.</p><p><strong>1. Private money lending. </strong>If you want to participate in the real estate space without actually buying and managing properties, one option is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-investors-earn-double-digit-returns-private-money-lending-2025-3\">lending capital to other investors</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s one strategy that financially independent couple Carl and Mindy Jensen are using to continue to grow their net worth.

The terms are determined by the lender and borrower and vary from deal to deal. The Jensens said that they&#39;re earning between 10 and 12% from lending.</p><p>&#34;The private lending generates such a nice return that it&#39;s difficult to be like, &#39;No, we don&#39;t want to have the easy money. Let&#39;s go do another live-in flip,&#39;&#34; Mindy told BI.</p><p><strong>2. Build-to-rent. </strong>Brannon Potts likes the idea of owning rentals but has found it challenging to make the numbers work in his area: &#34;The resale market is a little bit harder to pencil out and work financially.&#34;</p><p>His solution is to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-investor-shares-his-key-to-generating-cash-flow-2025-3\">build his rentals</a>.

He&#39;s designing the layout and working with a builder to bring it to life &mdash; a process that can take up to nine months for a multi-family property. &#34;But I&#39;m seeing a lot more financial reward from it at this moment than doing the resale side.&#34;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e7063a69253ccddf9aaadf?format=jpeg\" height=\"2268\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"brannon potts\"/><figcaption>Brannon Potts wears Hawaiin shirts daily to remind himself of his goal: To retire early and live on the beach.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Brannon Potts</p></figcaption></figure><p>As of March 2025, Potts has 10 completed doors and said he&#39;s averaging $330 a month per door. That&#39;s about $40,000 a year of relatively passive income, as his properties are new builds and don&#39;t require much maintenance or attention. He expects to hit financial independence once he gets to 20 doors, which he plans to do in the next five years and before turning 60.</p><p>He&#39;s earning more than just financial reward.</p><p>&#34;I love building &mdash; to be able to put my fingerprint on a property,&#34; he said. &#34;I really wanted to be proud of what we did so that our tenants got something wonderful that they could live in and hopefully take better care of it because it&#39;s just a little bit nicer than the ordinary.&#34;</p><p><strong>3. Real-estate syndication. </strong>With real-estate syndication deals, a group of investors pools their capital to purchase a single property managed by the syndicator.</p><p>New England-based investor and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/self-made-millionaire-shares-her-portfolio-how-she-invests-money-2024-7\">self-made millionaire</a> Tess Waresmith owns rentals, but she started investing in syndications in 2023 and says the strategy comes with unique advantages: It opens the door to bigger investment opportunities and is much more passive than managing rentals.</p><p>&#34;I check out the deal and make sure it&#39;s something that feels good to me, and then when I invest the money, I&#39;m hands-off,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;m not involved in the day-to-day decision-making of the property. But as an investor, I get to benefit from investing in the larger unit properties.&#34;</p><p>The Jensens, who are in two syndication deals, also appreciate the hands-off nature, but it can be difficult to predict your returns.</p><p>&#34;The people running these syndications will tell you they&#39;re expecting numbers, and it&#39;s infrequently accurate,&#34; said Carl. Keep in mind that the syndicator is &#34;probably using their best, sunny-day scenarios.&#34;</p><p>That said, &#34;every syndication we&#39;ve had has actually outperformed the original numbers.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-investment-strategies-help-build-wealth-financial-independence-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",
