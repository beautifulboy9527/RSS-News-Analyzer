    "source_name": "澎湃新闻",
    "content": "人类终极能源，又在A股“突破”。最近几个交易日，可控核聚变板块大爆发，掀起涨停潮。这与标志性工程迎来可喜进展息息相关——位于四川成都的新一代人造太阳“中国环流三号”首次实现原子核和电子温度均突破1亿摄氏度，进入燃烧实验新阶段。除此之外，澎湃新闻注意到，一则“中国计划在2030年前建成全球首座聚变-裂变混合发电厂”的外媒报道也是此轮行情的直接催化剂。\n“倒计时四年，见证奇迹！彻底改写能源史！”自媒体对此的描述更为浮夸。3月29日，据澎湃新闻多方核查，相关报道存在多处信息失真。目前，该项目处于前期阶段，以研究为主，后续能否走向商业电站存在很大不确定性。“2030年前将100兆瓦的世界首座聚变-裂变电厂并入电网”更是不可能的任务。\n有文章称，该项目由中国核工业集团与江西联创光电联合推进，选址江西南昌瑶湖科学岛，目标在2030年前建成并实现并网。澎湃新闻梳理发现，项目信息最早可追溯至江西省电子集团有限公司2023年11月在其官网发布的消息，称江西联创光电超导应用有限公司和中核聚变（成都）设计研究院有限公司签订协议，采用全新技术路线，联合建设可控核聚变项目，技术目标Q值大于30，实现连续发电功率100MW，该项目拟落户江西省，工程总投资预计超过200亿元。但该文并未明确提出“2030年前”这一时间节点。\n公开资料显示，江西联创光电超导公司创立于2019年6月，法定代表人伍锐。伍锐也是江西省电子集团有限公司的第一大股东，持股比例46%。\n伍锐为实控人的另一家企业联创光电（600363.SH）在资本市场聚变热潮中受益颇丰，从2024年9月的每股22元爆涨至最新收盘价62.68元。该公司的主要产品为半导体激光系列及航天微电子元器件、背光源及应用产品、光电通信缆、智能装备缆及金属材料、智能控制产品。\n29日，联创光电向媒体证实了2030年建成聚变电站的说法，但表示公司不是该项目主导方，主要向项目提供高温超导材料。\n近日，《中国核建-中核二三星火1号高温超导混合堆一期工程环境评价报告服务项目采购公告》在招标采购网站发布，也未明确项目的建设时间表。\n一位了解项目细节的聚变领域知情人士对澎湃新闻表示，该项目仍处于前期阶段，以研究为主，中核集团核工业西南物理研究院（下称西物院）参与了前期工作，但项目的后续商业化推进有不确定性。该人士称，纯聚变堆要实现大的Q值（聚变能量增益）难度很大，混合堆的能量增殖难度相对较低、聚变条件不像纯聚变堆那么严苛。\n西物院官网显示，该院对实验聚变-裂变混合堆的设计研究可追溯至“九五”时期。\n混合堆走向商业化电站的一大挑战来源于我国内陆核电建设尚无明确时间表，短期内预计不会放开审批。据澎湃新闻了解，各核电业主现阶段对于内陆核电还是以厂址保护、继续研究为主，内陆省份建商业核电站暂无可能性。\n上述知情人士对澎湃新闻称，实验电站和商业电站的厂址要求完全不同。在研究阶段，对厂址的要求相对少，若要进一步成为商业发电的项目，将面临极为严格复杂的选址和审批。\n混合堆也面临多重技术瓶颈。仅在材料方面，聚变反应产生的高能中子流（14.1MeV）对结构材料的损伤强度是裂变堆的100倍。相关资料显示，现有钨合金在1亿摄氏度环境下只能维持数百小时，而商业化电站要求20年免维护。俄罗斯DEMO混合堆项目因无法解决液态锂铅合金对反应堆壁的腐蚀，已暂停建设；美国NIF实验室至今未找到能承受Q值30工况的材料。此外，氚作为聚变燃料，年产量受限，混合堆的燃料循环难以为继。ITER官方报告明确指出，氚自持至少需要TBR≥1.3，目前技术无法实现。\n此外，从设计技术到制造技术与工艺的多次迭代、资金的筹集、新设备的研制、核能特殊的长周期建设，都决定了要在不足五年时间里建成全球首座聚变-裂变混合发电厂的可能性微乎其微。\n据澎湃新闻观察，近年来被称为“完美能源”的核聚变频频成为资本市场炒作的对象。但能源革命需要仰望星空，更需脚踏实地。中国在EAST装置403秒高约束运行、“中国环流三号”实现“双亿度”等聚变基础研究领域确实取得瞩目进展，但实验室突破不等于工程可行，技术验证也不等于商业落地。\n以“中国环流三号”为例，其目标是验证聚变堆物理与工程相关技术的可行性，还不是直接发电。按照我国核能发展战略，其应用预计在本世纪中叶（约2050年前后）实现，预计2045年左右进入示范阶段，有望在2050年前后商业化发电。后续还需突破稳态运行、材料与工程、经济性等瓶颈。\n为了合力攻坚，除了中国科学院等离子体物理研究所和核工业西南物理研究院这两支聚变研究主力军之外，真金白银大手笔投入、为未来聚变堆商业化应用打基础的国内可控核聚变“联队”也逐渐成形。\n去年12月29日，由中核集团牵头，联合24家央企、科研院所、高校等组成的可控核聚变创新联合体宣告成立，中国聚变能源有限公司（筹）正式揭牌。截至去年底，该联合体成员单位增至33家。中国核电（601985）、浙能电力（600023）2月28日公告增资入股中国聚变能源有限公司，投资金额分别达10亿元、7.5亿元。",

    "content": "春日融融，3月29日，上海市民文化节以“城市美育日”开启一年的精彩。千余场活动在城市的商圈、街区、社区、公园、广场、绿地、水岸等地展开。演出、集市、快闪、国潮、非遗、AI互动、CityWalk……处处洋溢着文化艺术氛围。市民在城市的街头巷尾，与文化艺术不期而遇。\n上海市民文化节“城市美育日”主会场首次走进商圈，设在嘉定安亭嘉亭荟\n促进文旅消费，非遗主题线下店开进商圈\n今年，顺应文体商旅展农联动的趋势，上海市民文化节“城市美育日”主会场设在嘉定安亭嘉亭荟商圈人流如织的开放中庭内。除了固定的座位，在商场每一层市民均可通过天井俯瞰演出场地。热闹的演出，点燃了整个商圈的气氛。\n开场广场舞《一道白相》瞬间点燃现场气氛，江桥“海之韵”舞蹈队的演员们用舞姿展现上海处处“好白相”的城市好风景。“文化根，民族魂，薪火相传是根本，江山代代有传人。”清脆的琵琶声配上清朗的童声响彻全场，一首讲述少年心声的弹词开篇迎来满堂彩。\n武术节目《中华武魂》汇集了多位外国参演者，右二为大熊，右三为教练郑明章\n虹口区文化馆选送的武术节目《中华武魂》汇集了来自伊朗、美国、泰国、瑞典、巴基斯坦等国的6位外国选手。“我从小就看功夫电影，想学中国功夫。”瑞典人大熊一身传统黑色金边太极练功服，谈起武术就兴致勃勃。他来到中国后，首先去的就是心目中的圣地武当山，来到上海后，又找到了上海精武体育总会拜师，学习了卢氏心意拳和八卦掌。带队教练、上海精武体育总会培训中心教练郑明章表示，每年都有受中华武术精神吸引的外国人前来学武，“这支外国人的队伍，代表的也是‘中华武魂’。”\n会演遴选了近年来上海市民文化节与社会大美育舞台上涌现的老中青少优秀团队，以民歌、戏曲、舞蹈、器乐、合唱等丰富多样的艺术形式，为观众们送上视听盛宴。\n舞台下的“风景”也精彩非凡。在商场2楼，首家嘉定区非遗主题线下综合店“嘉有好店”揭幕，汇聚了20多个非遗项目的150余件非遗商品，旨在“以店为媒，破圈入市”。\n自学洞箫的王女士特意来到现场选箫，“传承人做的箫音色真的不一样。”“嘉有好店”还有古琴等非遗乐器吸引她的注意，“平时我很少逛商场了，觉得千篇一律没有吸引力，但这家店值得专门来。”\n首家嘉定区非遗主题线下综合店“嘉有好店”\n“‘嘉有好店’为我们提供了一个固定展示非遗的场所，对非遗传播有很大帮助。”江南闺秀画区级传承人范东梅表示，平时他们面对消费者的场合主要是非遗市集，虽然热闹，但有些市民会顾虑流动摊位售后困难，或是之后有进一步了解非遗的意愿，却难以联系到传承人。如今“嘉有好店” 除了日常经营，还扮演着一个mini非遗展览馆的角色。在这里，消费者不仅能够参观、购买非遗产品，还可与传承人现场交流，预约体验课，亲自体验非遗技艺。\n当天，借着“美育日”的契机，嘉定区文旅线路推介携手10个美育点位齐齐“出摊”。现场还有汽车展区和体育项目展示区。嘉定区“社会大美育”联盟成立，47家成员单位携手，推动美育资源直达市民身边。\n“现在，我们利用碎片化的时间、场地进行‘美育一刻’的活动，例如小型画展、非遗展、快闪音乐会等。这几年嘉定一直在打造全民、全龄、全时、全域的社会大美育体系，集合全区美育资源，导入商圈、社区等人员密集场所，让百姓触手可及。” 嘉定区文化和旅游局副局长朱旭说。\n“这是我们市民文化节启动日的主会场首次走出文化场馆走进大型商圈，不仅为商圈注入了文化活力，也为商圈带来了更多人气。”上海市民文化节指导委员会秘书处办公室主任、上海市群众艺术馆馆长吴鹏宏表示，今年市民文化节办节通过文旅商体展农联动，不仅提升全民美育素养，还可以促进文旅消费，更好地实现社会效益和经济发展双丰收。\n各区分会场让“城市美育日”遍及上海\n各区分会场也纷纷走出文化场馆开展了多姿多彩的活动。“城市美育日”的精彩，遍及上海各地。\n在徐汇区襄阳公园，阿卡贝拉歌曲串烧以十首经典电影主题曲带领观众重温电影的时光长河，激发观众的共鸣与热情。徐汇区“拾光•汇影”2025年上海市民文化节徐汇区“城市美育日”暨纪念中国电影诞辰120周年主题活动上，几位大咖用电影美育导赏课拉开“美育第一课”的帷幕。\n上海音乐学院党委宣传部副部长、研究员肖阳结合国内外著名电影音乐片段，为观众分享了电影与音乐的双向赋能，揭秘电影音乐蕴含的情感力量和表达意义。上海交通大学媒体学院教授、电影史论研究专家李亦中、上影演员剧团团长、影视演员、主持人崔杰、上海中天新辰影视科技有限公司总经理高翰等电影人与观众分享了电影与徐汇，电影的历史与未来的故事。\n“创意是电影的核心，机器不可能完全替代人。未来，希望每一位普通市民都能借助AI，发挥自己的创意，拍摄出自己心中的故事。”高翰认为，如今风头正劲的AI会让更多人实现电影梦想。得益于现代技术，“人人参与、人人出彩”的美育愿景有了具象的呈现。\n徐汇区“城市美育日”以电影为主题，纪念中国电影诞辰120周年\n徐汇区作为中国“百年电影”发祥地之一，具有深厚底蕴。上海电影制片厂、上海电影博物馆等电影地标坐落于此，电影院团、影史名人旧居集聚，电影取景地众多。当天主办方推出涵盖“电影+音乐”“电影+阅读”“电影+美术”“电影+旅游”四大板块的美育系列活动。系列活动将贯穿全年、覆盖全域、普惠大众，共有12个系列、120项精彩内容，覆盖全区40+个公共空间和点位，并在“城市美育日”主题活动现场正式发布。\n当天，“银幕寻踪——10场电影主题展”的首场展览，中国电影诞辰120周年电影海报展在襄阳公园现场呈献。徐汇全域范围内同步开启了丰富多样的电影美育活动，衡山电影院、百代小楼前、夏衍故居等地开展了以电影为主题的“城市速写魔方”绘画之旅、爱乐随行——电影音乐快闪、纪念夏衍诞辰125周年主题活动等多样活动，市民可感受徐汇“百年电影”的文化魅力。\n长宁区非遗中心带领亲子家庭感受中医文化\n“莺边日暖如人语，草际风来作药香。”29日，长宁区非遗中心化身为“中医药科技实验室”开启了“苏河源起・沉浸城市故事会”智趣赋能亲子 City Walk 活动的第一站活动。亲子家庭通过“五感识药盲盒”挑战药材辨识，用赛博吉他弹《本草纲目》，在VR 中医馆穿越全息影像，沉浸式感受古代郎中“望闻问切”的诊疗智慧。在致和堂中医馆，孩子们变身“小小药剂师”，称量药材，制作驱蚊香囊；通过 AI 智能面诊与智能手表诊脉，获取趣味健康报告；特邀讲师现场科普《诗经》中的芍药等“课本彩蛋”，揭秘中医药与日常生活的紧密联系。爱馨苑的“会说话的自然课堂”将活动推向高潮，亲子家庭合力种下象征亲情的芍药花苗，制作嵌入 NFC 芯片的中药书签。孩子们在动手实践中理解“药食同源”理念，家长们则通过科技讲解重新认识身边的“天然药堂”。\n虹口区“城市美育日”主题活动在虹口上滨广场举行。开场演出《Karma因与果》由外籍人士剧团珍珠剧社带来。主办方向6位志愿者颁发了首批虹口国际文化志愿者证书。据区文旅局相关负责人介绍，随着虹口国际化社区的打造，越来越多的外籍人士积极参与虹口各类公共文化活动中，“本次活动遴选了热爱并积极参与群众文化的一批中外人士，为他们颁发首批虹口国际文艺志愿者证书，希望能更好地交流、传播中华文化、海派文化。”现场接受颁奖的代表，珍珠剧社社长、加拿大人Grant带领的珍珠剧社参与了公共文化配送，剧社还被评为2024年虹口区文化配送优秀社会主体。瑞典人大熊则走上了市级群文汇演的舞台，在嘉定主会场表演精武武术。海纳百川的上海为这些生活工作在上海的外籍人士提供了一个服务与被服务的公共文化平台，让他们能深度融入这座城市，绽放异彩。",

    "content": "3月27日，由“音乐剧之王”安德鲁·劳埃德·韦伯创作，莎拉·布莱曼领衔主演的英文原版音乐剧《日落大道》在北京艺术中心上演。这部承载好莱坞黄金时代记忆的经典音乐剧，此次以全新制作版本亮相，为观众带来了一场视听与情感的双重盛宴。\n音乐剧《日落大道》海报\n日落大道是美国洛杉矶最为著名的一条街道。1911年，好莱坞首家制片厂在这里成立，此地也是上世纪20年代大明星们的豪宅别墅区。1950年，比利·怀尔德编剧并执导的《日落大道》，以黑色喜剧的风格，讲述了一位过气的女明星诺玛·戴斯蒙德同年轻编剧乔·吉利斯间的爱恨情仇。电影上映后曾获得11项奥斯卡奖提名，并捧走了3尊小金人奖杯。\n电影《日落大道》以其尖锐的社会讽刺和对好莱坞黄金时代的深情回望，成为影史上的不朽传奇。也正是这部电影，点燃了音乐剧大师韦伯的创作灵感，开启了一段跨越数十年的艺术探索之旅，最终在1992年时把它从大银幕搬上舞台。\n音乐剧《日落大道》是一场关于梦想、衰老与遗忘的艺术寓言。它通过诺玛的悲剧命运，揭示了好莱坞光鲜外表下的残酷真相，同时也触及了人对时间流逝的普遍情感。这使其得以超越地域与文化的界限，成为国际音乐剧舞台上的璀璨明珠。\n《日落大道》剧照\n“月光女神”重返音乐剧舞台\n作为韦伯音乐剧的标志性女主角，莎拉·布莱曼曾以《剧院魅影》中的克里斯汀惊艳全球，被誉为“音乐剧传奇”。在世人对她那婉转空灵的歌喉念兹在兹三十年后，此番凭借饰演有声电影浪潮中陨落的默片时代巨星诺玛这一厚重的角色重返音乐剧舞台，诠释这位被时代抛弃的女演员的癫狂与孤独。\n此前在北京艺术中心举行的主演媒体见面会上，莎拉·布莱曼坦言对于重返舞台，“自己既紧张又兴奋。”谈及个人的中国情结，她也深情回忆了2008年北京奥运会开幕式上同刘欢联袂献唱《我和你》的过往，并期待用全勤演出的诚意，与中国观众共同书写新的艺术记忆。\n主演见面会\n“这是我首次以诺玛的身份演唱全剧。”莎拉说，“在接演这个角色之前，我同前夫韦伯先生通过电话。他告诉我，这部剧中的许多音乐都是为我的声线量身定制的。得知我这次要来中国演出，他也非常兴奋并向中国观众问好。”\n“对我而言，最大的挑战是将自己投身于剧中的时代。为此在前期我做了很多研究，想象当时好莱坞女明星的生活状态，尤其是她们从默片时代转换到有声电影时代都经历了什么。随着科技的进步，许多人都经历过心态的转变，我能够理解诺玛所经历的心路历程。”\n在3月27日晚的首演现场，从《一眼望去》（With One Look）的辉煌自述，到《仿佛我们从未说再见》（As If We Never Said Goodbye）的凄美独白，再到最后化身“莎乐美”的疯狂与失控，莎拉·布莱曼细腻又充满戏剧张力的演绎真切地反映出诺玛在时代浮沉中的挣扎与孤独，丝绒般音色的包裹下，是浓烈而悲怆的情感韵律。\n《日落大道》剧照\n与莎拉搭档的男主角蒂姆·德拉克斯同样备受瞩目。在此前不同版本的音乐剧《日落大道》中，澳洲明星休·杰克曼、被剧迷昵称“U叔”的德国演员乌韦·克罗格以及美籍华裔著名歌手费翔都曾饰演过野心勃勃的编剧乔。蒂姆不仅有着英俊的扮相，他在剧中所演唱的《日落大道》同名经典唱段，将角色在现实与理想的两难抉择间，那复杂的心态演绎得揆情度理又丝丝入扣。\n迈克尔·考密克饰演的管家马克斯，宛如一个神秘的多面体。他沉默冷峻，始终默默守护着诺玛，在看似冰冷的外表下却潜藏着如火焰般炽热的情感。凭借精湛的演技，演员将马克斯这一角色的复杂性进行了极为细致的诠释，每一个眼神、每一个动作都充满深意。值得一提的是，迈克尔·考密克在20年前曾饰演过剧中的青年乔，角色的轮回也是本版看点之一。\n除此之外，由玛丽·麦考里饰演的贝蒂青春靓丽、充满理想与朝气，甜美的歌声和灿烂的笑容成为舞台上的一抹亮色。而由贾罗德·德雷珀饰演的阿蒂、菲利普·洛饰演的德米勒导演，以及舞台上的每一位演员也都全情投入，共同构筑起好莱坞黄金时代的人世纷繁。\n华丽舞台复刻好莱坞浮华幻梦\n据介绍，该版《日落大道》由韦伯创立的真正好集团授权，GWB公司全新制作，澳大利亚歌剧院联合呈献，于2024年在悉尼歌剧院首演，中国巡演由北京保利剧院管理有限公司全程主办。舞台设计延续原版的华丽风格，并将电影中的胶片质感、暗黑美学与舞台科技深度融合，以沉浸式舞美复刻好莱坞黄金时代浮华与衰败的一体两面。\n剧中，德米勒在梦工厂迎接旧日搭档诺玛·戴尔蒙德的到来。片场场景融合机械美学与复古审美，工业化的建筑风格、随处可见的摄影装置，无不象征着彼时电影工业的朝气。而在暖黄色的灯光下，日落大道标志性的棕榈树作为点缀，也为场景注入了生机。\n“10086号别墅”内景空镜照\n诺玛居住的“10086号别墅”是全剧的核心场景。参照上世纪20年代洛杉矶哥特复兴风格豪宅样式设计的宽阔拱门，让诺玛的宅邸流露着永恒而神秘的气质。在这个沉浸式的空间中也处处可见设计团队的巧思与致敬：昏暗的灯光、颓败的家具营造出阴森的氛围，隐喻这座宅邸里环绕着的阴暗面；女明星所有的消费都是上门服务，复古电话成为豪宅与外界唯一的联系纽带，象征着诺玛与社会变革的脱节与割裂；客厅画框承载诺玛的银幕回忆，影射出她渴望复出的内在动机；巨型投影下的黑色蕾丝窗帘，重现了默片时代银幕女皇葛洛丽亚·斯旺森在1924年时经典造型，也令人联想到韦伯音乐剧《猫》的著名海报。\n莎拉·布莱曼剧中造型解析\n在当代时尚的演绎中，无论是复古的回归还是对经典的创新，“好莱坞风格”始终是一个重要的灵感源泉。影版中诺玛的饰演者葛洛丽亚·斯旺森，本就是默片时代的影后之一，其在银幕和生活中的造型常登上时装杂志的封面，一举一动也被广泛报道；剧中的诺玛，莎拉·布莱曼的造型也不遑多让，以30年代好莱坞电影明星造型为蓝本，身穿展现女性轮廓美的闪亮礼服，配上高档皮草和首饰，编织着关于青春、奢华、美貌的消费主义神话。\n据悉，此次原版音乐剧《日落大道》将在北京艺术中心持续上演至4月13日，演出期间，北京艺术中心将照例提供专属接驳车服务及丰富的周边文创体验。“诺玛同款”红毯打卡区和限时沉浸密室等特色展陈，也令观众在观剧的同时收获一段体验丰富的音乐剧之旅。",

But it seems the announcement trailer left out the best part.

Players will be able to link their Uni devices to the game to access special perks — kind of like how the beloved, defunct TamaTown worked. <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em> comes out on June 27.</p>\n<p>In <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em>, players will act as shopkeepers and help get the town ready for the big Tamagotchi festival. Some shops will include the option for local two-player. As for connecting your Uni, <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/tamagotchi-plaza-coming-this-june-to-nintendo-switch\">Bandai</a> says:</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><blockquote><p><em>T</em>amagotchi Plaza<em> features a linkage function with the Tamagotchi Uni. For the first time, players can connect with the latest toy model, the Tamagotchi Uni. By linking the Tamagotchi Uni, they will gain access to exclusive items, special events, and unique conversations not available in the base game, while supplies last.</em></p></blockquote>\n<div id=\"2799a0312e964bcdaeab6e949e7b4646\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLAh2gf07M4?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Considering the Tamagotchi Uni is nearing two years old now, anything that will inject some newness into the experience is welcome. For anyone who grew bored of the Uni and has been neglecting it, <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em> seems like a pretty compelling reason to dust it off and get playing again. Of course, you don't need a Uni device to play; it has enough appeal on its own as a super cozy game that'll tug at franchise fans' nostalgia.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-new-tamagotchi-game-for-nintendo-switch-will-connect-with-tamagotchi-uni-160639100.html?src=rss",

    "content": "<p>Back in 2022, Sony <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-game-preservation-team-143059442-143059184.html\">hired Garrett Fredley</a> to join its then newly formed Preservation team, which has been working to find and save documentation of PlayStation&#39;s 30-year history since then. Now, Fredley spoke at Game Developers Conference to give an update about his team&#39;s efforts. In his <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.gamefile.news/\">Game File newsletter</a>, Stephen Totilo has shared the details about Fredley&#39;s talk. Apparently, the team formed what it&#39;s calling the PlayStation Studios Vault to store everything it could find about Sony&#39;s game-making history.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Vault now houses game builds, source code and source art, but it has all kinds of other files, as well. Fredley explained that it was created to preserve &quot;everything that is ever related to a project you can possibly find: from documentation to audio assets, to prototype information, anything under the sun, even cultural artifacts.&quot; If it&#39;s adjacent to a PlayStation studio game, the team will store it in the Vault — even photos of developer teams that made the game. Currently, the oldest item in the team&#39;s collection has a 1994 timestamp and was from the tactical RPG <em>Arc the Lad</em>. The latest files include every customer-facing PS5 build of every PlayStation Studios game, as well as every debug, testing, alpha, beta and milestone releases. It has over 1,000 builds saved.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>At the moment, the Vault has two main servers located in Las Vegas, Nevada and Liverpool, England, which store 650 terabytes of data, or around 200 million files. That&#39;s almost double the 350 terabytes of data Fredley said the team gathered during another one of his talks last year. He expects to quickly go over the 1 petabyte of cloud server storage data the team&#39;s current setup can handle, especially since more and more games are being developed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The preservation team uses tools to help its work, including a robot called Vaultron that can read thousands of discs to find files. But it still hasn&#39;t been easy, since most studios don&#39;t exactly store their files in a way that makes them understandable and accessible decades from now. Going forward, Fredley and his team will have to solve a few problems that they&#39;re expecting to pop up. They&#39;ll need to have good indexing tools, for instance, and figure out a way to maintain the ability to use the files they collect.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-has-been-backing-up-its-ps5-game-builds-as-part-of-a-preservation-effort-150025423.html?src=rss",

    "content": "<p>The reviews train rolls on at Engadget. We&#39;ve had another busy couple of weeks, and more new devices are arriving for testing every day. For now, catch up on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reviews/\">our in-depth analysis</a> of the new base-model iPad, Nothing Phone 3a duo, some incredible sounding headphones and more.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ipad-2025-with-a16\">iPad (2025) with A16</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"39f92ac71b8b4b39a12bd1143a212dee\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ75TN5F?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>Apple has been busy updating several devices over the past few weeks, including the &quot;regular&quot; iPad. The company&#39;s entry-level tablet now has an A16 chip that offers plenty of power for most people. The iPad Air is still a better option if you can afford to spend more, according to buying advice senior reporter Jeff Dunn. &quot;But for $250 less than the latest Air, the iPad (A16) does well to meet most iPad users where they live,&quot; <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html\">he writes</a>. &quot;It’s not the most delightful iPad, but it’s good enough for the masses.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro\">Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"50f4b529d60b486998127aec85c6251e\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://us.nothing.tech/pages/phone-3a\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>The Nothing Phone 3a is much more than an update to the 2a when you consider the company opted to debut a new Pro model alongside it. There are concerns about a limited warranty in the US, but the 3a is a great budget device and the Pro has better-than-midrange cameras. &quot;It&#39;s really hard to criticize Nothing for any of the component choices, and if you&#39;re willing to take a risk on the company&#39;s limited US warranty and want something unique, these are the phones to buy,&quot; senior reporter <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html\">Igor Bonifacic explains</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-noble-audio-fokus-apollo\">Noble Audio FoKus Apollo</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"ee4ac75df8784545a6cc2e56bd5e55c7\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://nobleaudio.com/products/fokus-apollo\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>$649 is a lot to pay for a pair of wireless headphones. But if you&#39;re searching for the absolute best available sound quality, perhaps money is no object. Noble Audio&#39;s FoKus Apollo has a unique driver setup that offers a more expansive and detailed soundstage than the competition and long battery life, but that&#39;s about it. &quot;For me, to pay $649 I expect more in terms of features,&quot; <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html\">I argue</a>. &quot;The first item would be better ANC performance, but I don’t feel like spatial audio support and wear detection are too much to ask.&quot;</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-assassins-creed-shadows-and-a-cheap-tablet-battle\">Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows and a cheap tablet battle</h2> \n<p>Contributing reporter Kris Holt spent some time with the new Assassin&#39;s Creed title and came away with some mixed feelings on the game. &quot;<em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows</em> has impressive technical work, great performances and an expansive, well-drawn story but it&#39;s unfortunately weighed down by some frustrating decisions and antiquated gameplay systems,&quot; <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-review-an-ambitious-and-captivating-world-thats-stuck-in-the-past-170008367.html\">he writes</a>. &quot;Still, I&#39;m eager to keep exploring.&quot;</p> \n<p>In addition to reviewing the latest iPad, Jeff also pit the Amazon Fire HD 8 against Walmart Onn 8 in a battle of the sub-$100 tablets.

Unlike the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/solar-eclipse-2024-how-to-watch-and-record-the-total-eclipse-on-monday-163035394.html\">“Great American Eclipse” of 2024</a>, however, this will not be a total eclipse. Instead, this event will be a partial eclipse visible in parts of the northern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While this one will lack the dramatic \"totality\" of the 2024 event, a partial eclipse is still worth seeing. The sun will not be fully obscured, but with proper eye protection, you will be able to see the moon take a bite out of the sun. And there's a catch, but it's also an opportunity: This eclipse will occur at sunrise in North America, meaning the sun will just barely be above the horizon. But that timing offers viewers the chance to see the famed “devil horns” — a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://weather.com/science/space/news/2025-03-24-deep-partial-solar-eclipse-march-29\">crescent of solar light</a> emerging from behind the moon.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>When can you watch this partial solar eclipse, and those devil horns? Let’s talk about how to safely watch this eclipse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-areas-will-experience-the-partial-solar-eclipse-and-when\"><strong>What areas will experience the partial solar eclipse, and when?</strong></h2>\n<p>The partial solar eclipse will be visible in areas of the northern hemisphere. It will be visible at sunrise in eastern North America and sunset in Siberia, Russia on Saturday, March 29. In Europe, it can be viewed around mid-morning. But the event’s footprint will be limited: No eclipse will be visible west of Toronto, Canada, and Washington, DC in North America.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/ad23c430-0b10-11f0-96b6-02327a58f484\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/ad23c430-0b10-11f0-96b6-02327a58f484\" style=\"height:1024px;width:1024px;\" alt=\"This NASA map shows the extent of the moon's coverage of the sun during the March 29 eclipse.\" data-uuid=\"575ada27-91b1-31c0-a4b4-7f07eb8eab88\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div></figure>\n<p>This global map of the partial solar eclipse from NASA is more than a little confusing, but here’s how to read it. The yellow curve is the path of the partial solar eclipse, moving from west to east. The lighter colored yellow curves give the percent obscuration of the sun. (In other words, how much of the sun is covered by the moon depends on where you are and when you’re looking.)</p>\n<p>Most of Europe will only see around a 20 percent obscuration (with the exception of Greenland and Iceland), for example, while the extreme northeastern part of the United States will see up to 89 percent of the sun covered. The Nunavik region of Quebec will see maximum obscuration of 94 percent. The green lines on the map show the eclipse’s progress over time. Times are given in UTC, which is four hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time.</p>\n<p>However, sunrise and sunset makes things more complicated. This is depicted on the map by the orange loop. The left side of the loop (over the Great Lakes in the United States) shows where the eclipse <em>ends</em> at sunrise. Therefore, the eclipse is not visible west of that orange line. The right side of the loop is where the eclipse <em>begins</em> at sunrise.</p>\n<p>That means to see the maximum partial solar eclipse at sunrise, it’s best to be along that blue line running down the middle of the orange loop. (It’s worth noting that the eclipse will also be visible across a narrow part of Siberia, but at sunset rather than sunrise — that’s what the other half of the orange loop depicts).</p>\n<p>If it seems incredibly confusing, that’s because it is indeed incredibly confusing. Some places with maximum obscuration will have a shorter eclipse duration because the partial eclipse will start before sunrise. The sun will also be low to the horizon in North America, so any viewing location will need to be above tall trees with a clear view of sunrise. In Europe, the viewing locations will be easier because the sun will be higher in the sky — but the sun will not be as obscured.</p>\n<p>For example, in Bar Harbor, Maine, the sun will rise at 6:19AM, and the maximum eclipse will be at 6:22AM, with 80 percent of the sun obscured. The partial eclipse will end at 7:11 am. Technically though, the eclipse will begin at 5:26 am ET, but because that's before sunrise, Mainers will be cheated out of about half their potential eclipse viewing time.</p>\n<p>Moving south, the best view will be through coastal New England, then down through Boston, New York City and Philadelphia.The path basically ends in Washington, DC, where just 1.2 percent of the sun will be obscured at 6:59AM ET.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d245ba60-0b11-11f0-afb3-bac0a6f772d4\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d245ba60-0b11-11f0-afb3-bac0a6f772d4\" style=\"height:819px;width:856px;\" alt=\"Canadians will see the biggest bite taken out of the sun. \" data-uuid=\"2ae4ec29-780a-30ee-be59-c90c20eb4fb9\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div></figure>\n<p>According to<a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2025-march-29\"> Time and Date</a>, only 44,800 people will see a 90 percent partial eclipse, while 3,820,000 will see an 80 percent. That’s a far cry from the 30 million people in the path of totality for the 2024 total solar eclipse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-will-a-total-solar-eclipse-be-visible-in-the-middle-of-the-atlantic-ocean\"><strong>Will a total solar eclipse be visible in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean?</strong></h2>\n<p>No, there is nowhere on Earth that a total solar eclipse will be visible for this event. For any solar eclipse to happen, the sun, the moon and the Earth need to line up. However, because the moon doesn’t orbit in the same plane as the sun and the Earth, eclipses are rare.</p>\n<p>A partial solar eclipse, like the one occurring on March 29, occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, but it’s not perfectly lined up. As a result, the sun will have a crescent shape — as if the moon took a bite out of the sun — but it will never be fully obscured as it is during a total eclipse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-long-will-the-partial-eclipse-last\"><strong>How long will the partial eclipse last?</strong></h2>\n<p>The visible duration of the eclipse depends on where you are, and what time sunrise (or sunset) is at your location. But globally, the eclipse will begin at 4:50 am ET (8:50AM UTC). The maximum eclipse will occur at 6:47AM ET (10:47AM UTC), and the event will end at 8:43AM ET (12:43PM UTC). Keep in mind, though, that this doesn’t mean the entire partial eclipse will be almost four hours long in any given location because this is just for the extreme edges of the event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-weather-forecast-along-the-viewing-line\"><strong>What’s the weather forecast along the viewing line?</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s spring across the Northern Hemisphere, which generally means unfavorable weather for any sky viewing. The Weather Channel’s<a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://weather.com/science/space/news/2025-03-24-deep-partial-solar-eclipse-march-29\"> senior digital meteorologist Chris Dolce</a> said that cloud cover, and even rain and snow, may be likely in the northeastern United States during the eclipse, so it’s not great news there, unfortunately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-if-its-just-a-partial-eclipse-do-i-need-eye-protection\"><strong>If it’s just a partial eclipse, do I need eye protection?</strong></h2>\n<p>Anything that involves looking at the sun, even just 5 or 10 percent of the sun, <em>requires</em> eye protection. The sun can damage your retinas quickly, painlessly and often irreversibly.</p>\n<p>If you have solar viewers left from the 2024 eclipse, and they are undamaged, they’ll work just fine for this one too. According to the American Astronomical Society (AAS), modern eclipse glasses do not expire. It’s worth checking them out thoroughly, though, making sure there are no rips, tears or scratches across the lenses and that the filters and lenses are still attached to the frame.</p>\n<p>Solar eclipse glasses can be difficult to purchase at the last minute, so it’s always good to keep them around. However, if you donated or trashed your previous pair (or didn’t buy them in the first place), you can buy them online — with some caution. Make sure any solar viewers conform to the ISO 12312-2:2015(E) international safety standard, and check the manufacturer against this<a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/viewers-filters\"> list of brands from the AAS</a>.

When the sun rises during an eclipse (and therefore the sun is low on the horizon), as the crescent sun rises, it can look like devil horns coming up out of the ground.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/b910aff0-0b16-11f0-bdbd-24a9625e5a25\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/b910aff0-0b16-11f0-bdbd-24a9625e5a25\" style=\"height:4160px;width:6240px;\" alt=\"Between layers of clouds, a partial solar eclipse is seen at sunrise over Rice Lake, Ontario, as the sun, partially covered by the moon, rises in a beautiful orange sky above the trees and water.\" data-uuid=\"829aee11-4b67-3b45-8a51-073be3b65b83\"><figcaption>An earlier sunrise partial eclipse over Rice Lake, Ontario shows the \"devil horns\" phenomenon.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">John Fader via Getty Images</div></figure>\n<p>It’s best to target Maine, New Brunswick, and Quebec (along the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5510/\">blue line in the NASA map</a>) to see this phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the sun is currently at or near solar maximum, which means that our star is basically at the peak of its 11-year solar cycle. Scientists determined that the sun hit the highest level of solar activity in October 2024, and this will continue for a year or so. This means that there may be sunspots visible on the surface of the sun when the eclipse hits. (For context, here’s what the sun<a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_1024_HMIIF.jpg\"> looks like right now</a>, courtesy of NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory.) If you have solar binoculars or a solar telescope, this will make them much easier to see.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-can-i-just-point-a-telescope-or-camera-at-the-sun\"><strong>Can I just point a telescope or camera at the sun?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you’re asking yourself this question, you probably already know the answer: Nope! Not without a solar filter. Whether it’s a phone camera, binoculars, a telescope or a mirrorless camera, the sun can do extreme damage to this kind of equipment. (On Apollo 12, astronaut Alan Bean accidentally pointed a television camera at the sun,<a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/seeing-apollo-12\"> irreparably damaging it</a>.

The Core 400S can cover rooms up to 1,980 square feet using a three-stage filtration system to capture allergens, dust, pet dander and smoke. It also includes a smart sensor that adjusts fan speed based on air quality, so you’re not running it at full blast when you don’t need to.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"c29f331b44054946abedb3f426cdb00d\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R794ZMX?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>One of the Levoit Core 400S’ biggest selling points is its low noise output, which makes it a good fit for bedrooms or home offices. If you need to knuckle down and get some work done without distraction whilst keeping your room’s air clean and fresh, even at higher speeds, it stays relatively quiet compared to bulkier purifiers. It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands.</p> \n<p>Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness.</p> \n<p>If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/one-of-our-favorite-air-purifiers-is-down-to-a-near-record-low-price-for-the-amazon-spring-sale-133052069.html?src=rss",

    "source_name": "Engadget",
    "content": "<p><em>Baby Steps</em> is a video game about hiking. This is, of course, a ridiculous concept.</p>\n<p>Before we get to the game’s protagonist, an adult toddler in a thin onesie, or its unserious side characters and nonsensical narrative, we have to acknowledge the absurdity at its very core. Leisurely walking around in nature is perhaps the most organic, least technological activity a person can engage in, and the desire to digitize this experience, recreating it for consumption from the butt-shaped cushions of your couch, is silly. It’s such a patently Game Developer™ impulse that, actually, I find it adorable. Much like the rest of <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Baby Steps</em> is a walking simulator from a trio of veteran game developers: <em>Dance Central</em> creator Maxi Boch, <em>Ape Out </em>developer Gabe Cuzzillo, and Bennett Foddy of <em>QWOP</em> and <em>Getting Over It</em> fame. It’s heading to PC and PlayStation 5 this year, and since its <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/baby-steps-is-the-3d-qwop-weve-all-been-waiting-for-130829279.html\">announcement video</a> dropped in June 2023, it’s been a hotly anticipated curio for fans of annoyingly precise traversal mechanics and offbeat indie shit. It’s a larger audience than you might think.</p>\n<div id=\"c72e24917b174a2ab7e3abff16fc1803\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ2Zdn5w6Dk?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div>\n<p>I played about 45 minutes of <em>Baby Steps</em> at GDC 2025 while Boch, Cuzzillo and Foddy looked on and intermittently told me how good I was at walking. The game stars Nate, an unemployed adult dude who lives in his parents’ basement, as he explores an arid mountain landscape one shaky, unsure step at a time. Maneuvering his body in the proper way is the main goal, and it’s a tricky one. Using a gamepad, you control Nate’s legs individually, one per trigger, and his limbs are incredibly sensitive to small changes in button depression. Pull a trigger tight to lift and bend one of his knees, and release it bit by bit to swing out his lower leg and place his foot precisely where it needs to be. Press forward with the left stick to give Nate just the right amount of momentum, get your trigger rhythm right, and suddenly, hey, you’re walking here.</p>\n<p>It sounds easier than it is. Thanks to the game’s incredibly precise mechanics, Nate falls over easily, faceplanting in the dirt and tumbling backward over rocky slopes like a ragdoll, covering his grey onesie in mud and sweat. This same precision also makes Nate shockingly sturdy at times, like when he pulls his whole body onto a ledge with a single step, ending in a perfectly balanced flamingo stance. There’s room in the controls for both mastery and mayhem, and by the time I put down the gamepad, I was walking Nate around with all the grace of a perfectly adequate five-year-old. I was proud of this accomplishment, too, damn it.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d9cf9db0-0b65-11f0-bfff-d1a31dfaf0a1\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d9cf9db0-0b65-11f0-bfff-d1a31dfaf0a1\" style=\"height:720px;width:1280px;\" alt=\"Baby Steps\" data-uuid=\"90dcdfd9-e96b-3816-a400-c0065b8f0d95\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devolver Digital</div></figure>\n<p>Literally placing one foot in front of the other requires so much concentration in the game’s first few minutes that it’s easy to ignore Nate’s surroundings, but as walking becomes easier, you’re finally able to look around and ask, “What the hell am I doing here?” The first two chapters of <em>Baby Steps</em> are set on a mountainside dotted with craggy rocks, patches of brown grass, long-abandoned wooden buildings, random carousel horses and dirt pits, and the only indication of where to go is an orange glow emanating from a ridgeline high above Nate’s spawn point.</p>\n<p>The few folks Nate meets along the way — a charmingly aloof guide and at least one other, much more prepared hiker — are incredibly entertaining to interact with, but they’re also pretty unhelpful with existential questions. Nate murmurs and monosyllabizes his way through conversations, and he tends to get cut off by the NPCs’ eager observations. Like when I was playing, Nate fell and got stuck at the bottom of a muddy hole, and his guide friend showed up and immediately said, “This hole used to be dry. Hey, did you pee in the hole? <em>Did you pee in this hole?</em>” In response, Nate made anxious noises and generally panicked.</p>\n<p>The comedy in <em>Baby Steps</em> is sharp and chaotic, with a delirious, improvised edge. Foddy does the voice work for most of the characters, and he tends to just make up their lines at the mic. The result is a messy yet refreshing conversational flow, and every cutscene I encountered made me chuckle.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d9cf9db1-0b65-11f0-a63f-fff2fbd78691\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/d9cf9db1-0b65-11f0-a63f-fff2fbd78691\" style=\"height:720px;width:1280px;\" alt=\"Baby Steps\" data-uuid=\"9bd59ee4-c86e-35b9-97c4-0df0eaef9eea\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devolver Digital</div></figure>\n<p>Most aspects of <em>Baby Steps</em> made me smile, in fact. At one point I entered a fast-walking groove while wandering along a rocky path on the edge of the canyon, and I realized the birdsong and the thuds of my own steps had morphed into a rhythmic song, encouraging my gait with a steady, organic beat. The game’s soundscape comes courtesy of Boch, and it intentionally ebbs and flows according to the way you play the game. Combine this responsive, immersive soundtrack with the constant focus you have to keep on Nate’s movements, and <em>Baby Steps</em> quickly becomes a hypnotic experience. The game’s details only encourage this feeling — the mountain is strangely beautiful, rendered in crisp 3D graphics, and it’s completely explorable, with no invisible walls in sight. If you can see it, you can attempt to climb it. Nate’s onesie collects sweat along the small of his back, under his arms, and in all the crannies you’d expect, and it also picks up mud when he falls, but the stains wash away when you get in water. On-screen prompts are rare. There are hidden hats to wear and penis graffiti to admire, and Nate can take numerous paths to reach the same point, bouncing pancake butt leading the way.</p>\n<p>Behind all the absurdity, <em>Baby Steps</em> is an incredibly well-crafted, hyper-detailed relaxation tool. While it is laugh-out-loud funny, its mechanics cut deeper than its oddball trailers suggest, and in practice, it actually left me feeling meditative. <em>Baby Steps</em> is a serious silly game.</p>\n<p><em>Baby Steps</em> is being published by Devolver Digital, and it’s due to hit <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008588/\">PS5</a> and PC <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281040/Baby_Steps/\">via Steam</a> later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/baby-steps-preview-serious-gameplay-in-a-silly-walking-sim-150008737.html?src=rss",

Still, it is not yet clear if or when Google plans to bring Android gaming and fullscreen support to the stable track of Android Auto.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/beta-test-brings-candy-crush-soda-saga-and-angry-birds-2-to-android-auto-143021332.html?src=rss",

Yes, our choice for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">2025's best wireless headphones</a> have dropped to $318 from $400 — a 20 percent discount. They briefly dropped to $250 earlier in the sale, but have since jumped back up a bit. Nevertheless, this is a good sale price overall; you can grab them on discount in either the silver of smoky pink colors.</p> \n<p>There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony's XM5 headphones are one of them. I've raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they're so comfortable. I've worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1ac44183cd18494aa9f35b4e3c702314\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XSDMT4F/ref=twister_B0DVBB1P9M?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they're a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn't hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don't have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Their excellence on flights isn't the only reason we gave Sony's XM5 headphones a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478-160045458.html\">95 in our review</a>. They're also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound's quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don't fold up, but especially at this price, they're still such a great buy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This discount is part of a larger <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0546f03f-780a-4149-8dec-b500ea48d48a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2V2ZW50cy9iaWdzcHJpbmdzYWxlP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA1NDZmMDNmLTc4MGEtNDE0OS04ZGVjLWI1MDBlYTQ4ZDQ4YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ldmVudHMvYmlnc3ByaW5nc2FsZSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATwOaAhU59YDZ4JMGaXGcUKUz6lSZr7IWv5apVQInoG1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fevents%2Fbigspringsale\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/events/bigspringsale?ref_=nav_cs_gb&amp;discounts-widget=%2522%257B%255C%2522state%255C%2522%253A%257B%255C%2522refinementFilters%255C%2522%253A%257B%255C%2522departments%255C%2522%253A%255B%255C%2522493964%252F24046923011%255C%2522%255D%257D%257D%252C%255C%2522version%255C%2522%253A1%257D%2522\">sale on headphones and earbuds</a> for the Amazon Spring Sale.

As <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/instagram-now-lets-you-speed-up-videos-just-like-on-tiktok/\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has reported, the app now allows users to play Reels at 2x the speed by long-pressing on the right or the left edge of the screen. They&#39;d simply have to release it if they&#39;d like to resume watching at normal speed. Some users have had access to the feature <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1i9psl0/2xs_speed_for_watching_reels/\">for a while now</a>, while others <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1e0j7ak/is_the_2x_speed_not_working_anymore_on_reels/\">used to have it</a> until Instagram removed it from their accounts, likely because the app was only testing it out. Now, an Instagram rep has told <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/instagram-launching-ability-to-play-reels-at-2x-speed/\"><em>CNET</em></a> that it&#39;s rolling out to everyone.

Being able to fast-forward Reels has become somewhat of a necessity for a lot of people today, seeing as Instagram&#39;s short-form videos are no longer limited to 15 seconds in length like they used to be. Reels can now be <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-swoops-in-with-3-minute-reels-and-rectangular-profile-grids-as-the-tiktok-ban-gets-real-201316339.html\">as long as three minutes</a>, and there are signs indicating that the app could allow uploads <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reportedly-making-reels-longer-to-take-on-tiktok-and-youtube-163059898.html\">as long as 10 minutes</a>. We wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Instagram started allowing Reels that long in the future.

Most wireless extenders plug into an AC outlet and connect to your existing router so they can then rebroadcast it to spots that your router alone may not cover well. As a rule of thumb, you’ll get the best results by placing the extender half way between your router and the dead zone you’re trying to fix.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>One important thing to note about Wi-Fi range extenders (also sometimes called “repeaters”) is that most of them actually create a new Wi-Fi network when rebroadcasting your existing one. That network will have a new name (it’ll often be your default network’s name with an EXT appended at the end, unless you change it) and that means you’ll have to connect to different networks when in different parts of your home. While that’s a small tradeoff in return for improved coverage, some will be more inconvenienced than others.</p> \n<p>If you’d rather have one, much larger network in your home, you’re better off upgrading to mesh networking systems. Mesh systems come with a main router and access points that, by default, create one large Wi-Fi system that should be accessible throughout your whole home. They tend to be the best Wi-Fi routers you can get, but that also translates to more expensive, and possibly more complicated, devices. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are, by far, more costly than a simple extender, plus you may have to work with your ISP to get your home’s existing network working on your new router.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-wi-fi-extender\">What to look for in a Wi-Fi extender</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-speed\">Speed</h3> \n<p>Extenders today can support single, dual or tri-band Wi-Fi, and they will tell you the maximum speeds they support on all of their available bands. For example, one dual-band device might support 600Mbps speeds over its 2.4GHz band and up to 1300Mbps over its 5GHz band, for a combined maximum speed of 1900Mbps. For the best performance, you’ll want to go with a Wi-Fi extender that has the highest speeds possible (and those, as you might expect, tend to cost more). Some extenders even support Wi-Fi 7, giving you the latest in wireless technology for higher bandwidth, faster speeds and lower latency.</p> \n<p>However, it’s important to remember that Wi-Fi extenders are not true “signal boosters” since they are not designed to <em>increase</em> speeds across your home. In fact, you may find that the extender’s network is slower than your router’s. Instead, extenders are designed to increase the strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, making them ideal for filling in dead zones. Some mesh extenders can help create a more seamless network, reducing the drop in speed and improving connectivity in larger spaces.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-range-and-number-of-supported-devices\">Range, and number of supported devices</h3> \n<p>With the name of the gaming being coverage area, taking note of a device’s range is important. Depending on the size of your home and property, you may only need up to 1,200 square feet of coverage. But those with larger homes will want to spring for an extender that can support upwards of 2,000+ square feet of coverage.</p> \n<p>Similarly, those with lots of gadgets will want an extender that can handle them all at once. If you spend most of your time on your phone or laptop and maybe have your smart TV online for a few hours of Netflix each day, you could get by with a more limited extender. Smart home aficionados and tech lovers should invest in one that won’t buckle under the pressure of a few dozen connected devices. This is especially important if you plan on linking all of the devices in a certain part of your home to your Wi-Fi range extender’s network, rather than directly to your existing router. Some models with external antennas can improve performance by providing stronger, more directional signal coverage.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>There isn’t a ton of innovation when it comes to design in the Wi-Fi extender space. Most of the ones you’ll find today are rounded rectangles roughly the size of your hand that plug into a standard wall outlet. They usually have a few indicator lights that will show you when the extender is connected, how strong its signal strength is and when there’s a problem, and some will even have moveable external antennas that companies claim provide even better Wi-Fi signal. Generally, they are pretty simple to install and get connected, but if you’re struggling with how to set up your Wi-Fi extender, there are plenty of YouTube videos you can check out.</p> \n<p>Aside from that, there are the scant few standalone Wi-Fi extenders that sit on an end table or a desk, and those look pretty similar to regular ol’ routers. But make no mistake, anything labeled as an extender or a “Wi-Fi repeater” will need an anchor router in order for it to work.</p> \n<p>Another convenient feature you’ll find on most Wi-Fi extenders is an extra Ethernet port (or a few). This allows you to use the extender as a Wi-Fi access point if you connect it to your existing router, or an adapter to provide devices like TVs, smart home hubs or game consoles a hardwired connection to the internet. Unsurprisingly, this wired connection usually provides you with the fastest speeds possible, so you may want to use it for your most crucial devices.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wi-fi-extender-faqs\">Wi-Fi extender FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-wifi-booster-and-extender\">What's the difference between a wifi booster and extender?</h3> \n<p>Nowadays, there’s really no difference between a Wi-Fi booster and Wi-Fi extender - they’re just different names for the same thing. Previously, however, Wi-Fi boosters were devices that received signals from wireless routers, broadcasting them to another network. This essentially extends the range of the signal. Wi-Fi extenders expand the coverage within your home’s Wi-Fi network, but often you will see extenders described as boosters.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-a-wi-fi-extender-better-than-a-mesh-router\">Is a Wi-Fi extender better than a mesh router?</h3> \n<p>Mesh routers, or mesh Wi-Fi systems, use multiple devices (or nodes) across your home to create a larger home network. Essentially, you have multiple routers around your home with these systems, and that will hopefully provide the best coverage possible. Wi-Fi extenders, on the other hand, are usually just one device that extends your existing Wi-Fi signal, and they often require you to switch networks when connecting. Wi-Fi extenders are more affordable, though, and are great if you’re traveling or need a Wi-Fi signal in harder-to-reach areas. However, a mesh router can offer a better long-term solution to upgrade your entire home’s Wi-Fi.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-should-i-use-multiple-wi-fi-extenders\">Should I use multiple Wi-Fi extenders?</h3> \n<p>Some people may need to use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, for instance, if your home is large or has dead zones in different areas. But if you do use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, there’s a chance of interference. You may also need to manually connect to the extenders separately, which isn’t always convenient.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html?src=rss",

But if you want something that’s less distracting and easier on your eyes, you may want to go with an ereader instead. As it stands, the market is currently dominated by two brands.

Smaller companies like Onyx Boox and PocketBook produce Android tablets with e-paper screens that can do more than just display books.<br><br>Other considerations, such as whether or not you need a color display or the ability to write on the screen for note-taking, will determine which ereader to buy. Factors like library size, compatibility with rights-managed content and more also come into play. Over the past two years, we’ve tested out more than a dozen devices to create a guide to help you pick the best ereader for you — and help you get the most out of your new gadget once you get it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-the-best-ebook-readers-for-2025\">Best ereaders</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader\">What to look for in an ereader</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-to-get-books-for-your-ereader\">How to get books for your ereader</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-we-test-ereaders\">How we test ereaders</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-ebook-readers-for-2025\">The best ebook readers for 2025</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1274c90c9fde47829265f8da658feb74\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-clara-colour\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"9fc1c2819e014c8d97210c838b03af76\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"61cf957b946140ab8f21b982cd8635fb\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"fa35d953a61f44fd8de06f5da06c4cbf\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPP8C33\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"bc9202d0f3024d3d9066d714527f1148\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://shop.boox.com/products/gocolor7\" data-original-url-bc920-btn-0=\"https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Go-Color-ePaper/dp/B0D4DN8N8W?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"de6aca0140fe475ea386587a3a0ec2ab\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Palma-Mobile-ePaper-G-Sensor/dp/B0CQ7VRNFS\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader\">What to look for in an ereader</h2> \n<p>Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on a phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Color ereaders add a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido\">color filter array</a> on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.</p> \n<p>Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.</p> \n<p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">E Ink tablets</a> like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-reading-features\"><strong>Reading features</strong></h3> \n<p>With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p> \n<p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.</p> \n<p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-other-features\"><strong>Other features</strong></h3> \n<p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html\">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read <em>Crook Manifesto</em>.</p> \n<p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p> \n<p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read.

It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-upload-epubs-onto-an-ereader\"><strong>How to upload ePubs onto an ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Stores like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/\">ebooks.com</a> and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books?hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Google Play</a> have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Titles from some publishers like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/publisher/tor-publishing-group/207044153?_c=1\">Tor</a> and public domain classics from sites like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:17;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">Project Gutenberg</a> are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader <em>do</em> support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.</p> \n<p>To do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called <a data-i13n=\"cpos:18;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7247b01c-2a32-4141-aac1-4e4bb8170ec0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rite+Aid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjQ3YjAxYy0yYTMyLTQxNDEtYWFjMS00ZTRiYjgxNzBlYzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL3NvbHV0aW9ucy9lYm9vay9kaWdpdGFsLWVkaXRpb25zL2Rvd25sb2FkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYfVa2G0Z86CjcQZkqWy4CaRDfMi0aF2N0kUMd-_t-hK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html\">Adobe Digital Editions</a> (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover.

But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg.

Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.</p> \n<p>Recently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:23;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/bookshoporg-is-now-selling-ebooks-113033975.html\">up to 100 percent of the profits</a> will go to local booksellers.

Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs.</p> \n<p>To read library books on a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:28;pos:1\" href=\"https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html\">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p> \n<p>For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.</p> \n<p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/0376ace0-cf17-11ed-8f7e-8cbebb86b05f\" alt=\"Four ereaders are arranged on a dark brown wooden table outside.

data-i13n=\"cpos:45;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html\">Amazon’s first color Kindle</a> impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.</p> \n<p>Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\"</p> \n<p>Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-which-ereaders-can-read-kindle-books\"><strong>Which ereaders can read Kindle books?</strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-you-buy-kindle-books-without-a-kindle\"><strong>Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?</strong></h3> \n<p>Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can <em>only</em> be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-kindle-and-kobo\"><strong>What's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?</strong></h3> \n<p>Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.</p> \n<p>The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store.

Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>March 2025</strong>: Added news about Bookshop.org getting into the ebook market.

There are some significant differences from the original console, however.</p>\n<p>The most obvious one is that the next-gen Joy-Cons will no longer slide into place mechanically. Instead, they appear to attach to the main unit magnetically. There is a small connector that's likely used to charge the controllers. It's unclear at this point if Joy-Cons from the original system will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p>\n<p>One other big (and very welcome) change is the addition of a second USB-C port on the top of the device. That should make it much easier to plug in accessories while the Switch 2 is docked. FCC filings suggest that you'll be able to charge the console using either USB-C port, which is another nice quality-of-life change.</p>\n<p>It's great to see that Nintendo has kept the headphone jack as well. Let's just hope that Bluetooth headphone support is live from the jump this time and Nintendo doesn't leave everyone <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-011133744.html\">waiting <em>four years</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>for that feature.</p>\n<p>The kickstand is getting an upgrade. As with the Switch OLED, it spans the length of the console this time around. But, according to the reveal trailer, this one looks fully adjustable, so you can tweak the viewing angle to one that works for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are still a great many unknowns regarding the upcoming console. We don't really know the specs yet, or what type of display it uses. We also don't know anything about battery life, the UI or launch games. We'll surely learn a whole lot on April 2.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-come-out\">When will <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 </strong>come out?</h2>\n<p>2025. That's all we know for sure at this point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's highly unlikely that Nintendo will release the console before the dedicated Direct on April 2, and not only because that's at the start of Nintendo's next financial year. However, accessory manufacturer Genki, which has been a major source of leaks in recent months, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/01/08/nintendo-accessory-maker-claims-switch-2-is-launching-in-april-mock-up-based-on-actual-console/\">claims the console will be released in April</a>. Other reports have pegged June as the release window, as have several analysts.</p>\n<p>In any case, we should learn the release date during the April 2 Direct.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-can-i-try-the-nintendo-switch-2\">When can I try the Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>\n<p>Nintendo is planning a worldwide roadshow to let gamers go hands-on with the console. These events start in New York and Paris on April 4-6, with others taking place throughout the following two months. That lends credence to some suggestions that Nintendo will release the Switch 2 in June.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ticket registration for many of the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events has closed, but <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/\">waitlists</a> <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/nintendo-switch-2-experience/\">are available</a>. However, given that Nintendo is taking a first come, first served approach, your chances of attending the roadshow if you don't already have a ticket (or unless you signed up for the waitlist immediately) seem very small at this point.</p>\n<p>The full list of Nintendo Switch 2 Experience dates is as follows:</p>\n<p>North America:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>New York, April 4-6, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Los Angeles, April 11-13, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Dallas, April 25-27, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Toronto, April 25-27, 2025</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Europe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Paris, April 4-6, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>London, April 11-13, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Milan, April 25-27, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Berlin, April 25-27, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Madrid, May 9-11, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Amsterdam, May 9-11, 2025</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oceania:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Melbourne, May 10-11, 2025</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Tokyo (Makuhari), April 26-27, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Seoul, May 31-June 1, 2025</p></li>\n<li><p>Hong Kong, To be announced</p></li>\n<li><p>Taipei, To be announced</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-have-some-weirdness\">Will the Nintendo Switch 2 have some weirdness?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Everything we've seen and so far about this console has been fairly, well, traditional. It looks like the original Switch, but better. That's awesome, but will there be any of that unpredictable Nintendo magic? Maybe! There are two puzzling additions that folks can't make hide nor hair of.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"f59216adba4b480bba6dc0ad0294c9e2\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Genki, the accessories manufacturer, just published a landing page for their Nintendo Switch 2 accessories.

This has led to speculation that players will be able to flip the Joy-Con over and use it like a mouse.

That would align with the magnetic Joy-Con attachment scheme.</p>\n<p>But much like the weird mouse rumors, it doesn’t necessarily align with, well, any logical reason for why you’d want to do that. The patent suggests it could allow for more user choice in where the headphone jack is. But since it’s Nintendo, the company that brought us <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-26-nintendo-labo-review.html\">Labo cardboard peripherals</a> and the Game Boy Advance e-reader <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_e-Reader\">attachment</a>, we have to wonder if there are… quirkier designs at hand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible\">Is <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 </strong>backwards compatible?</h2>\n<p>The company confirmed in November 2024 that the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/youll-be-able-to-play-your-nintendo-switch-games-on-its-successor-045657774.html\">Nintendo Switch 2 will be backwards compatible.</a> It will also feature access to Nintendo Online, so users will be able to play all of those old retro titles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the initial Nintendo Switch 2 press release, Nintendo reiterated that physical and digital Switch games will work on the new system. However, it noted that \"certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.\" More details about which games those are will be revealed later.</p>\n<p>During a Nintendo Direct on March 27, the company revealed a new system for loaning digital Switch games out to friends and family members. <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-just-introduced-a-way-to-loan-out-digital-games-to-friends-and-family-150733308.html\">Virtual Game Cards</a> are designed to make it easier to start a game on one console and continue on another as well. Although Nintendo's approach to this is <a data-i13n=\"cpos:17;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-digital-switch-game-sharing-plan-could-be-so-much-simpler-190353732.html\">not as simple as it perhaps should be</a>, Virtual Game Cards will also be available on the Switch 2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-will-old-games-be-enhanced-in-any-way\">Will old games be enhanced in any way?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The original Switch has, to put it mildly, struggled to run <a data-i13n=\"cpos:18;pos:1\" href=\"https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-game-frame-rate/\">some of the late-generation software</a> that's come down the pike. Could these games be enhanced to take advantage of the increased horsepower of the Switch 2? We have no idea. We also don't know if any of these releases will receive graphical upgrades, perhaps taking advantage of upscaling tech.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-cartridges-taste-like\">What will the cartridges taste like?</h2>\n<p>You may remember that the original Switch cartridges <a data-i13n=\"cpos:19;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/1/14784140/nintendo-switch-cartridges-taste-awful-psa\">taste absolutely awful</a>. This was on purpose, to discourage folks from putting the games in their mouth. Will the successor follow suit and continue to dip cartridges in a foul-tasting bitter coating? Only time will tell.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-specs\">What about specs?</h2>\n<p>The rumors regarding specs are all over the place, so it’s tough to pin down. We know one thing for sure: It’ll be more powerful than the ancient Switch hardware, which was already antiquated back in 2017. One analyst allegedly got a hold of a spec sheet from the <em>Korean United Daily News</em> that said the Switch 2 <a data-i13n=\"cpos:20;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-disappointingly-underpowered-heres-what-we-know\">would boast an eight-core Cortex-A78AE processor</a>, 8GB of RAM and 64GB of internal eMMC storage. This tracks, as these specs are about as underpowered now as the original Switch was in 2017. However, some reports <a data-i13n=\"cpos:21;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/\">do indicate that the console</a> will include 12GB of RAM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another source suggests that the eight-core CPU will be packaged inside an NVIDIA-produced <a data-i13n=\"cpos:22;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\">Tegra239 SoC (system on a chip)</a>. Given the current Switch runs on an NVIDIA chip, that makes a lot of sense. The CPU will be more powerful, but it's the Switch 2's new GPU that will be a major differentiator. It's all-but-confirmed that the Switch 2 will support DLSS, NVIDIA's \"deep learning supersampling\" upscaling tech, which would allow the console to render games at a low resolution internally while outputting a high-resolution image. (Fun fact: We actually wrote about <a data-i13n=\"cpos:23;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-14-nvidia-rtx-mesh-shaders-dlss-tensor-cores.html\">how perfect DLSS was for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> when the technology was announced alongside the RTX 20 series back in 2018.)</p>\n<p>There are still questions about the Switch 2 and DLSS: Will the system support <a data-i13n=\"cpos:24;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html\">newer DLSS features like frame generation</a>? Will existing games be automatically tidied up by NVIDIA's algorithm? Regardless of the exact implementation, DLSS upscaling will be a huge leap over the rudimentary techniques available to Nintendo Switch developers.</p>\n<p>As for the display, there are many conflicting rumors. Early reports from solid sources suggested the Switch 2 would have an 8-inch LCD screen. The Switch 2's display certainly looks larger than that of the original Switch in a side-by-side comparison in the reveal trailer. Some folks have worried that the Switch follow-up <a data-i13n=\"cpos:25;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/what-if-the-nintendo-switch-2-is-too-big-150002921.html\">may actually be too big</a>, especially for kids.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Certain analysts have suggested this would be an OLED screen, while others have said it would be a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:26;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-pro-could-sport-a-mini-led-display-heres-why-that-matters\">Mini-LED display</a>. A Mini-LED display is basically an LCD display that has a backlight made of (surprise!) mini-LEDs rather than edge lighting. This allows for local dimming, making the blacks more black.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We're hedging our bets here. We think it’ll be a standard LCD, to cut costs, with an OLED or Mini-LED model coming later down the line. However, Mini-LED screens are slightly cheaper than OLED displays, so that’s certainly a possibility at launch.</p>\n<p>As for resolution, recent reporting suggests that the console will output 1080p in handheld and 4K when docked. That's much better than the OG Switch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More <a data-i13n=\"cpos:27;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/gamestops-internal-database-lists-multiple-switch-2-accessory-skus\">tenuous “leaks”</a> have <a data-i13n=\"cpos:28;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/lexar-is-apparently-releasing-a-switch-2-microsd-express-card\">intimated</a> that the Switch 2 could also support a faster microSD card standard known as microSD Express. This allows for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:29;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/bus-speed-default-speed-high-speed-uhs-sd-express/\">significantly faster</a> transfer rates than the common UHS-I cards supported by the Switch today.

But again, these rumors are far from concrete. It’s also worth noting that microSD Express cards cost significantly more than what we usually see today — the SanDisk card we tested, for instance, starts at $45 for just 128GB of storage.</p>\n<p>Recently-unearthed FCC filings also indicate <a data-i13n=\"cpos:34;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-will-feature-wifi-6-and-offer-nfc-support-per-the-fcc-192242046.html\">that the console will support Wi-Fi 6 and NFC</a>. The latter indicates that the Switch 2 will continue Amiibo integration.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost\">How much will the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?</h2>\n<p>We don't have too much information regarding price but we do have plenty of history to work with. The original Nintendo Switch launched at $300, which is pretty much the \"magic number\" when it comes to Nintendo console releases in recent years. The Wii U also came in at $300.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, there are plenty of rumors circulating that Nintendo could be upping the asking price for the Switch 2. Several analysts are expecting Nintendo to hike the price to at least $400 and possibly even as much as $500. Rising costs of components and development, as well as US tariffs, are likely to mean that the Switch 2 is more expensive than its predecessor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dipping back into history, there is some precedence for a price uptick. The GameCube was $200 and the Wii was $250. The Wii U and Switch increased to $300 and, well, numbers like to go up. A $400 price tag would make the Switch 2 nearly as expensive as a PS5 and Xbox Series X. That would also put it at the same price as the 256GB LCD Steam Deck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Again, we should get confirmation of the price during the April 2 Nintendo Direct.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-well-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-sell\">How well will the Nintendo Switch 2 sell?</h2>\n<p>Even with an expected price increase, Nintendo is likely to sell boatloads of Switch 2 consoles. The company seems to be positioning itself to shatter sales records. Reports suggest that Nintendo wants to have as many units ready to sell as possible on release day. One analyst told <a data-i13n=\"cpos:35;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> that they expected Nintendo to have an inventory of between 6 million and 8 million units at the outset.</p>\n<p>As <em>Bloomberg </em>notes, the company sold 2.7 million Switch units in that console's first month. Sony's PS4 and PS5 each sold 4.5 million units in their first quarter on the market, though it's worth noting the PS5's early momentum was <a data-i13n=\"cpos:36;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-short-supply-through-2022-090543238.html\">hindered somewhat by shortages</a>.</p>\n<p>Nintendo has sold <a data-i13n=\"cpos:37;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-sees-sales-dip-as-switch-2-debut-looms-130047928.html\">more than 150 million Switch units</a>. Given that many fans are more than ready for an upgrade (and to perhaps give their old Switch to a young relative or sell it on the cheap), the Switch 2 is very likely to go gangbusters right out of the gate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-do-we-know-about-any-launch-games\">Do we know about any launch games?</h2>\n<p>Not so much. The reveal trailer offered a peek at a new Mario Kart game. Nintendo released <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>on the Wii U over a decade ago and it's been milking that cash cow ever since, having sold more than 64 million copies of the game across that console and the Switch. It's definitely time for a new entry!</p>\n<p>It's certainly <a data-i13n=\"cpos:38;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-26-super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-review.html\">been a long time since</a> we’ve gotten a proper 3D Mario adventure as well, so a new one could be a launch title. That would be one heck of a system seller. Other than that, your guess is as good as ours. Past as prologue, we can expect something from Ubisoft and an off-the-wall title like <em>1-2-Switch</em>. One report suggested that <a data-i13n=\"cpos:39;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/powerwash-simulator-2-will-arrive-later-this-year-164534571.html\"><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></a> is bound for the Switch 2, so that's something.</p>\n<div id=\"e52c76b4c1064d809c9c32a002b0c09a\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMAgmdR8jwU?si=wFpt_JElWcUNSKqL\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If there’s a gimmick or hook involved with the console, we’ll also get a game that takes advantage of that. A dual release of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, just like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em> before that, is also a possibility.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's all but nailed on that we'll learn much more about the Switch 2 launch lineup during the April 2 Nintendo Direct, which starts at 9AM ET.

The biggest announcement from the company&#39;s latest Direct was its upcoming <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-just-introduced-a-way-to-loan-out-digital-games-to-friends-and-family-150733308.html\">Virtual Game Cards feature</a>, a new approach to sharing digital games that improves on the company&#39;s current system, but still carries limitations that keep it from feeling truly modern.</p>\n<p>Virtual Game Cards attempt to make digital games as easy to share as physical ones. That starts with the company visually representing games as &quot;cards&quot; and using the language of loading and ejecting them, and extends to how simple they are to share. Two Switch consoles logged into your Nintendo Account can share any digital game just by &quot;ejecting&quot; it from one and &quot;loading&quot; it on another. The only catch is that the consoles need to be connected over local wireless (as in, be physically near each other) when the trade happens, and be able to access the internet to download the game and run it for the first time.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"02193b003e30499d863699e9affef616\"><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>You can similarly share a Virtual Game Card with anyone in the same Nintendo Account family group for two weeks, after which the game automatically returns. In both cases, saves for each game stay on the console where the game was played, making it simple to share the Virtual Game Card again and keep playing.</p>\n<p>In comparison to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47524/~/how-to-play-your-games-across-multiple-nintendo-switch-systems\">Nintendo&#39;s current system</a>, which requires defining a Switch console as &quot;primary&quot; and able to be used offline and other devices as a &quot;secondary&quot; and needing an internet connection to play shared games, Virtual Game Cards are a meaningful improvement. If you&#39;re a parent trying to share games with your kids or a super-fan with multiple Switches (something Nintendo no doubt wants to encourage), Virtual Game Cards have basically solved the problem — or at least made it much easier to manage and understand. The company isn&#39;t exactly leading the pack here, though.</p>\n<p>If I own a game on PlayStation, I can download it on my Playstation 4 and PlayStation 5, and play on either console, without needing to go through the rigamarole of ejecting virtual cards. The same goes for Steam games. Valve even goes further and lets the vast majority of games be shared and played on accounts connected to the same <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-families-library-sharing-is-live-and-you-can-all-play-at-the-same-time-231044311.html\">Steam Family</a>, without your computers needing to be near each other when you &quot;hand-off&quot; games.</p>\n<p>People are highly sensitive to any kind of DRM. Just ask Xbox, which had big plans to change how loaning games work when the Xbox One was announced, but had to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-08-xbox-one-drm-reversal-history.html\">dramatically backtrack</a> after basically everyone complained.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nintendo isn&#39;t pulling an Xbox, per se, but it is pitching something adjacent. Virtual Game Cards are inarguably better than how things work now, but they require an internet connection and they still limit how many people can play a game at once. Nintendo came up with a better mental model for sharing games, but not necessarily a better way to do it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-digital-switch-game-sharing-plan-could-be-so-much-simpler-190353732.html?src=rss",

The previous models included e-paper screens. The big draw, however, is not what this phone has but what it doesn’t have. There are no third-party apps. There’s no access to social media, the internet or even email. It’s intended to be, first and foremost, a phone.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"2ad0c30385e5404a8a68418e4d8a8594\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KhMb0-t2MyU?si=kxutWgR18RYNtai7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p>It’s not completely bare. This model includes an embedded NFC chip for making payments, a bare-bones music player, a podcast player, a messaging app, a flashlight, voice notes, a calendar, a timer and an alarm. It also includes a simple camera system that was inspired by point-and-shoot models. There’s a two-step shutter button with center focus and a fixed focal length. The company calls it “genuinely fun.”</p>\n<p>The Light Phone III has a navigation app, which is likely the most useful part of modern smartphones, but with a twist. The company paid for private access to navigational information, so Here (the mapping platform powering the app) has no visibility into where you go or what you search for.</p>\n<p>Other specs include 6GB of RAM, up from 1GB in the Light Phone II, 128GB of memory and a newer Qualcomm chip. It includes a fingerprint ID on the power button, a USB-C port and some loudspeakers at the bottom. The battery is also user-replaceable, which is a huge bonus. It’s larger than previous generations and I find it to be pretty cute. It&#39;s around the width of a modern iPhone, but much shorter. This was on purpose, the company says, to make it easier to text while holding it vertically.</p>\n<div id=\"aa39cedf85d446419d2f2a0ec0197a38\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYFDe9F62VA?si=osluXBBuPOVwZKcz\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p>There is a spot of bad news here. The Light Phone III costs $799, which dwarves the price of the second-gen model (though it is far more capable of a device). That said, you can still put in an order at the pre-order price of $599 for now —&nbsp;we&#39;ll see how long that sticks around for.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, March 27 2025, 1:15PM ET: </strong>This story has been updated to note that the Light Phone navigation app uses Here, not Google for mapping. It also has been updated to note that the $599 pre-order price is still available for now.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-minimalist-light-phone-iii-is-officially-available-for-purchase-150056138.html?src=rss",

Normally priced at $275, this is the best discount we&#39;ve seen on the 2-in-1 robot, matching the sale price we saw during the holiday shopping season last year.</p> \n<p>As you can see in our roundup of the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">best budget robot vacuums</a>, we’ve consistently rated iRobot’s machines highly for their reliability and ease of use. The Roomba Combo Essential is a simple, no-frills option that both vacuums and mops, making it a solid pick for small apartments, dorm rooms or anyone who wants a cleaner floor without spending a fortune.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"bb9d5cbaa11941678737444c519321c5\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVJ3K8FF?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>The vacuum uses special multi-surface brushes to pick up dirt, dust and pet hair from hard floors and carpets. Unlike some budget models that struggle with transitions, this one automatically adjusts to different surfaces, so you won’t have to worry about it getting stuck. When it’s time to mop, the built-in mopping pad wipes down hard floors, tackling light spills and everyday messes. It’s not as advanced as iRobot’s higher-end models with precision scrubbing, but it’s a convenient way to keep your floors looking fresh with minimal effort.</p> \n<p>One of iRobot Roomba Combo Essential&#39;s most convenient features is its auto-adjusting cleaning power — the robot increases suction when it detects extra debris, so it’s more effective on high-traffic areas like entryways or around pet bowls. It also has cliff sensors to prevent it from tumbling down stairs and a low-profile design that helps it slip under some couches and other furniture for a more thorough clean.</p> \n<p>Despite it being an entry-level robot vacuum, the iRobot Roomba Combo Essential comes with app control and voice assistant support, so you can set cleaning schedules and initiate cleaning whether you’re at home lounging on the couch or away on vacation. For $150, this is a solid deal for an iRobot machine that can vacuum and mop, especially considering its usual $275 price tag. If you’ve been thinking about automating some of your floor cleaning, this is one of the most affordable ways to do it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-vacuum-deals-this-irobot-2-in-1-vacuum-and-mop-falls-to-149-123058239.html?src=rss",

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/events/bigspringsale/\">Big Spring Sale</a>, as it is known, is happening now and runs through Monday, March 31st, bringing with it a slew of discounts on gardening supplies, bedding, and other necessities. While the discounts aren’t as steep as during tentpole events like Prime Day or even Amazon’s October event (and the frequency of new deals coming to the surface has slowed down), you can still find steep savings on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-2-TwoCameras-White/dp/B0BWX39R5W/\">security cameras</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489/\">headphones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-41mm-Smartwatch/dp/B0D912YVPQ/\">smartwatches</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D3PB2DBS/?th=1\">best football video game</a> released in the past year, and loads of other tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve dug into all the deals and discounts available so far, the best of which you’ll find below.

It’s pretty stylish, overall, and can last just as long and do just as much as a Fitbit (if not more). We also like it for its wide breadth of health and workout-tracking features, along with its support for built-in GPS and contactless payments. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23500640/garmin-venu-sq-2-review-smartwatch-fitness-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read our full review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"other-verge-favorites\">Other <em>Verge</em> favorites</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Blue Yeti microphone</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY6Z2M6/\">Amazon</a> in a myriad of colors starting at $89.99 ($40 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One of our go-to gift guide picks, the <strong>Instant Pot Duo Plus</strong>, is currently available for an all-time low of $89.95 ($40 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBKTPTS\">Amazon</a>. Multiple <em>Verge</em> staffers swear by the six-quart multi-cooker, which is similar to the base-model instant pot but comes with a few additional smart programs, including a customizable sous vide setting and a cake option that lets you pressure cook at high temperature for 40 minutes. That’s in addition to the ability to cook rice, steam veggies, and sauté, among other actions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Govee may be best known for its ambient TV backlighting, but it also makes lighting products to illuminate your entire living space in shades of RGB. One of its most stunning lights, the <strong>Smart Table Lamp 2</strong>, is on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D41XL87F\">Amazon</a>. It can provide vibrant lights for a gathering, or you can adjust its color temperature to suit your bedtime and wake-up rituals better.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Having access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed. If you’ll be out in the wild, or if you’re vacationing but want to be cautious when it comes to water intake, the <strong>LifeStraw Peak</strong> is worth picking up at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SBPWHS7/\">Amazon</a> for its current price of $18.62 ($6 off). It’s essentially a thick straw outfitted with a filter that’s capable of removing 99.9 percent of bacteria, parasites, and microplastics from the water you’re drinking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cagiwiru’s Cordless Air Blower / Duster</strong>&nbsp;is down to an all-time low of $18.04 ($7 off) at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CAGIWIRU-Compressed-Cordless-LED-Light-no-dusters-car/dp/B0CCD7KPM6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a> (at checkout). It might not be as powerful as a can of compressed air, but it’s close, and it’s much more versatile with its swappable tips, built-in light, and ability to recharge via USB-C.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>AeroPress Go </strong>is nearly matching its best price to date at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Portable-Travel-Coffee-Press/dp/B07YVL8SF3/\">Amazon</a>, where you can pick it up for $31.95 ($18 off). It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst <em>Verge </em>staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the <strong>ChomChom Roller</strong>, especially since it&#8217;s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BAGTNAQ\">Amazon</a> for $19.59 ($5 off). This simple tool can de-fur your couch faster and more effectively than most vacuums, even if it’s not the best tool for ridding clothes of unwanted hair.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We like Hoto’s svelte toolkits for a couple of reasons. They strike a minimalistic look, for one thing, and they incorporate at least one power tool. The company’s <strong>Drill Tool Set</strong> — which is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YTNLDJG\">Amazon</a> for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wildfire season might be a ways off, but if you’d like to get ahead, you can pick up <strong>Coway’s Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty </strong>from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coway-AP-1512HH-Mighty-Purifier-True/dp/B00BTKAPUU/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://cowaymega.com/products/mighty-ap-1512hh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Coway</a> for $165 ($75 off), which nearly matches its second-best price to date. The compact HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system, and though we don’t do a ton of dedicated air purifier testing here at <em>The Verge</em>, we can personally attest to the effectiveness of this midrange model for smaller rooms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, March 29th:</strong> Updated to reflect current pricing/availability and several new deals, including discounts on SwitchBot’s Smart Switch Button Pusher and the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

They’ve warned that the efforts to wind down the agency have already left many consumers without sufficient recourse for their complaints about financial services. In recent years, the CFPB has increasingly become a check on the technology industry as tech companies grew into the financial services space. (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/599137/x-money-payments-service-2025-launch\">For example, Elon Musk’s X purports to eventually become a payments service.)</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as DOGE got involved at the agency, according to reporting and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/628327/cfpb-nteu-vought-shut-down\">testimony presented before the judge</a>, the CFPB <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy/612933/cfpb-tech-team-gutted-trump-doge-elon-muskhttps://www.theverge.com/policy/612933/cfpb-tech-team-gutted-trump-doge-elon-musk\">terminated technologists</a> —&nbsp;who would, obviously, be necessary staff when regulating tech companies —&nbsp;and placed much of its workforce on administrative leave. After CFPB Acting Director Russell Vought told agency staff on February 10th to “stand down from performing any work task,” workers testified they followed that order literally. Allegedly, this surprised the administration, with one official later clarifying that statutorily mandated work should still get done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The judge says she was “left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything,” saying that the government’s arguments that CFPB workers were back to work have “been shown to be unreliable and inconsistent with the agency’s own contemporaneous records.” She also condemned an “eleventh hour attempt to suggest immediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jackson opens her opinion with quotes from Musk (the public face of DOGE), Vought, and President Donald Trump about their alleged intentions to eliminate the agency. For instance, Musk tweeted “CFPB RIP” on February 7th. “The CFPB has been a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,” Vought said the following day. A couple days later, Trump added, “That was a very important thing to get rid of.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Essentially, the CFPB can — for now — get back to work</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Jackson came to the conclusion that unless she takes action, “the RIF [reduction-in-force] notices that have already been prepared will go out before the ink is dry on the Court’s signature, the employees will be back on administrative leave for just thirty days before they are gone, and the defendants will pull the plug on the CFPB.” While this isn’t a final ruling, as part of issuing the injunction, Jackson says the workers’ union is likely to ultimately succeed in court on its claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The judge <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69624423/88/national-treasury-employees-union-v-vought/\">orders</a> the Trump administration to reinstate all probationary and term employees terminated since February 10th, carry out no further terminations without cause or issue any RIF notice, lift the administrative leave requirements and stop-work order, and let employees either return to an office or work remotely. She also requires that the government maintain CFPB data and records, and rescind contract termination notices sent since February 11th. Essentially, the CFPB can — for now — get back to work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Workers are cautiously celebrating. “While we are thrilled and relieved at today’s outcome, union members are under no illusion that this is the end of Trump’s lawless attacks,” CFPB Union President Cat Farman says in a statement. “Vought has already violated previous court orders by deleting data and failing to reinstate illegally fired workers. We can&#8217;t rely on judges alone to keep wannabe dictators in check. We need everyone to join the fight to save our services, unionize our workplaces, and create more good middle class jobs doing vital work that benefits working people instead of billionaires and Wall Street.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In its latest Windows 11 Insider Preview, the company says <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/28/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26200-5516-dev-channel/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20removing%20the%20bypassnro.cmd%20script\">it will take out a well-known bypass script</a> that let end users skip the requirement of connecting to the internet and logging in with a Microsoft account to get through the initialization process of a new PC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As reported by <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-will-force-windows-11-installs-to-use-a-microsoft-account-confirms-removal-of-popular-setup-bypass\"><em>Windows Central</em></a>, Microsoft already requires users to connect to the internet, but there’s a way to bypass it: the bypassnro command. For those setting up computers for businesses or secondary users, or simply, on principle refuse to link their computer to a Microsoft account, the command is super simple to activate during the Windows setup process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Microsoft cites security as one reason it’s making this change:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the bypassnro command is disabled in the latest beta build, it will likely be pushed to production versions within weeks. All hope is not yet lost, as of right now the script can be reactivated with a registry edit by opening a command prompt during the initial setup (Press Shift + F10) and running the command:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\OOBE /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f shutdown /r /t 0&#8243;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, there’s no guarantee Microsoft will allow this additional workaround for long. There are other workarounds as well, such as using the unattended.xml automation that lets you skip the initial setup “out-of-box experience.” It’s not straightforward, though, but it makes more sense for IT departments setting up multiple computers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of late, Microsoft has been making it harder for people to upgrade to Windows 11 while also nudging them to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336586/microsoft-windows-10-upgrade-year-of-the-windows-11-pc-refresh-ces-2025\">move on from Windows 10</a>, which will lose support in October.

In a tweet, he described it as an all-stock transaction, valuing xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, including $12 billion in debt it had<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23437120/elon-musk-twitter-product-subscription-verification-revenue-debt-finance\"> as part of his takeover</a>. “This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” writes Musk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In response to a deal cementing about $11 billion in lost value since the 2022 sale, X CEO Linda Yaccarino <a href=\"https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1905737074298572880\">posted</a>, “The future could not be brighter.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite failing so far to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285681/x-elon-musk-everything-app-bank-fail\">make X an “everything app,”</a> Musk has tied these two ventures together closely since<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23792553/elon-musk-xai-artificial-intelligence-company\"> launching xAI</a> in the summer of 2023, saying that access to the vast trove of data from Twitter / X would give it a major advantage, and prominently placing xAI’s Grok tool within the social app. This week, Grok launched an integration beyond X,<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/637114/telegr\"> joining Telegram</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The arrangement is also a reminder of a previous Musk deal combining two companies he controlled. Tesla Motors <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13698314/tesla-completes-acquisition-solarcity-elon-musk\">acquired SolarCity</a>, a company with Musk as its largest individual shareholder and his cousin Lyndon Rive as CEO, for $2.6 billion in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14470094/tesla-motors-name-change-inc-solar\">dropped “Motors”</a> from its name. Musk didn’t mention Tesla in the announcement, after already proclaiming “I have, like, 17 jobs” at <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/633907/elon-musk-tesla-employee-meeting-stock-value-drop-cybercab-optimus\">a hastily-announced all-hands meeting</a> for the car company last week — it’s unclear if this deal adds to or subtracts from the number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today’s tweet also didn’t mention his ambition for the service to handle “someone’s entire financial life,” but it does repeat his claim of X as “the digital town square.”As we noted in January,<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24339249/elon-musk-xai-x-twitter\"> xAI staffers were also X employees</a>, with company laptops and access to its code base. Musk had also<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1726177644671091192\"> previously claimed</a> X investors would own 25 percent of XAI, but as of January, that had not materialized for X employees with shares in the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While X’s valuation had reportedly dropped since the 2022 takeover before <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/632337/x-bounces-back-to-44-billion\">recently rebounding</a>, the value of xAI has risen along with other companies in the space like Nvidia and OpenAI, where Musk has gone from co-founder and early investor to rival and legal antagonist since walking away in 2018.<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musks-startup-xai-valued-at-50-billion-in-new-funding-round-7e3669dc\"> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a><em> </em>reported xAI had been valued at $50 billion in an investment round last November, more than double its $24 billion valuation during another funding round in the spring of 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1905731750275510312\">Elon Musk:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">@xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at unprecedented speed and scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">X is the digital town square where more than 600M active users go to find the real-time source of ground truth and, in the last two years, has been transformed into one of the most efficient companies in the world, positioning it to deliver scalable future growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach. The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge. This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would like to recognize the hardcore dedication of everyone at xAI and X that has brought us to this point. This is just the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thank you for your continued partnership and support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Sign up for <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=reprint&amp;placement=top-note\">The Big Story newsletter</a> to receive stories like this one in your inbox</em>.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.</p>\n<p>In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.</p>\n<p>A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”</p>\n<p>But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:</p>\n<p>“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us\">column Kennedy wrote</a> for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”</p>\n<p>ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.</p>\n<p>“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”</p>\n<p>For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html\">promoted them with confidence</a>. One campaign was called “<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm\">Get My Flu Shot</a>.” The agency’s website <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html\">told medical providers</a> they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”</p>\n<p>Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.</p>\n<p>Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.</p>\n<p>When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’s communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes—nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”</p>\n<p>“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”</p>\n<p>Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”</p>\n<p>The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.</p>\n<p>Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.</p>\n<p>In late February, for example, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html\">forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1</a> bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general US population, they said, was low.</p>\n<p>In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the US is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)</p>\n<p>The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”</p>\n<p>This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”</p>\n<p>The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”</p>\n<p>Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.</p>\n<p>During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated\">NPR reported</a> this.</p>\n<p>But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.</p>\n<p>On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated <a href=\"https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB\">child had died</a> of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/\">downplayed the seriousness</a> of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/\">only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, the CDC added <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html\">an entry on Vitamin A</a> to its measles website for clinicians.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, CNN reported that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html\">several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function</a>, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.</p>\n<p>Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/\">will hinder their ability to respond</a> to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.</p>\n<p>Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20 percent of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html\">nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children</a> with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html\">linger in the air</a> for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.</p>\n<p>This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/\">rode one of its trains</a> from New York City to Washington, DC.</p>\n</div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://pixel.propublica.org/pixel.js\" async></script></p>\n<p> </p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/the-cdc-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/the-cdc-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

Gorilla Glass maker Corning has announced a new material that might help save the day the next time you drop a phone. The company claims its latest Gorilla Glass Ceramic can withstand drops that would shatter lesser materials.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, Corning's new glass incorporates ceramic components to improve strength compared to other types of hardened glass. Corning has offered a bit of data to support this claim. In its <a href=\"https://www.corning.com/microsites/csm/gorillaglass/PI_Sheets/CGG_Gorilla%20Glass%20Ceramic_PI%20Sheet.pdf\">lab tests</a> (PDF), Gorilla Glass Ceramic withstood 10 drops from one meter onto surfaces that closely resemble asphalt. Why Corning does not use real asphalt for this test is unclear.

By exploiting a model's inability to distinguish between, on the one hand, developer-defined prompts and, on the other, text in external content LLMs interact with, indirect prompt injections are remarkably effective at invoking harmful or otherwise unintended actions. Examples include divulging end users’ confidential contacts or emails and delivering falsified answers that have the potential to corrupt the integrity of important calculations.</p>\n<p>Despite the power of prompt injections, attackers face a fundamental challenge in using them: The inner workings of so-called closed-weights models such as GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini are closely held secrets.

We&#39;re annual pass holders and Disney Vacation Club owners. Our living room is dedicated to all our Mickey and Minnie souvenirs. As much as we can&#39;t wait to take our grandkids to the Magic Kingdom, we vowed never to pay them a $150-plus entrance fee until they&#39;re 6 or 7 years old. That way, they&#39;ll remember the experience.</p><h2 id=\"6813af8e-5229-4804-87ed-e9229ada6f99\" data-toc-id=\"6813af8e-5229-4804-87ed-e9229ada6f99\">It&#39;s expensive and exhausting</h2><p>Thirty years ago, I took my three children, ages 5, 8, and 9, to Disney World. We spent six glorious days having Snow White, Jasmine, Goofy and all the characters sign their autograph books. The Bugs Life show in the Tree of Life made the kids shriek with laughter when bug boogers (water) sprayed at them. It&#39;s a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-genie-plus-skip-lines-worth-it-for-family-disneyland-2024-4\">Small World was their favorite ride</a>.</p><p>Sadly, my youngest doesn&#39;t remember any of these wonderful family moments because he was too young.</p><p>Seeing parents and grandparents trying to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-world-too-expensive-hard-to-do-everything-former-employee-2023-12\">get every dollar&#39;s worth out of their tickets</a> by wrangling tired, screaming babies and pleading with terrified toddlers to stand next to the Green Army Man from Toy Story and a smile takes the magic out of the Happiest Place on Earth. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve shifted our strategy.</p><h2 id=\"709f198e-eead-4388-bf74-193a99c6bae3\" data-toc-id=\"709f198e-eead-4388-bf74-193a99c6bae3\">We still take them to Disney World but not to the parks</h2><p>We still love to take our grandchildren to Disney World &mdash; either staying in our RV at <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/camping-at-disney-world-not-worth-it-fort-wilderness-review-2022-11\">Fort Wilderness Campground</a> or Saratoga Springs, our home resort. Sometimes, we drive there for the day and park at the transportation center. But we don&#39;t go inside the parks. Instead, we spend hours riding the free transportation &mdash; boats, monorails, buses, and gondolas.</p><p>Disney World is more than just the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-world-all-parks-one-day-family-review-2023-6\">Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom</a>. Once we drive under the Walt Disney World entrance arch, we&#39;ve entered a magical place where every inch is landscaped, and all cast members are friendly. It&#39;s about the memories we&#39;ve made over the years and the new memories we&#39;re creating with our grandkids.</p><p>Every time we walk into the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-disney-world-most-expensive-resort-worth-it-grand-floridian-review-2023\">Grand Floridian resort</a>, my husband says, &#34;My dad used to love to have a glass of chardonnay in that bar behind where the band used to play.&#34; I can tell he&#39;s fondly picturing his now-deceased father at his favorite table, looking out the dome-shaped window.</p><h2 id=\"63263dae-e9af-4682-9ad8-f94c44eec491\" data-toc-id=\"63263dae-e9af-4682-9ad8-f94c44eec491\">We have so many memories</h2><p>We&#39;re excited to have a new generation of kids to share our happy place, although I often have to remind my husband of our agreement. He&#39;s a kid himself when we&#39;re at Disney. </p><p>He&#39;s tempted to take the twins into Magic Kingdom to see their eyes light up as they gaze at Cinderella&#39;s Castle and be enchanted by Disney&#39;s Festival of Fantasy Parade. That&#39;s almost worth all the money just to see him excited to watch them, but I don&#39;t want to set a precedent for future visits (for the grandkids or my husband).</p><p>We did capture our time at Disney by utilizing their photographer who stood outside the Magic Kingdom ticket gate. She positioned us in front of a Mickey landscaped in flowers and the Main Street clock tower. She snapped some pictures and scanned my Magic Band so we could entertain the 3-year-olds by looking at the images in our annual pass account while waiting for the monorail. One of our favorites.</p><p>Another favorite, the Disney Skyliner &mdash; free gondola transportation &mdash; runs between multiple resorts, EPCOT, and Hollywood Studios. We love to watch the tiny people from as high as 60 feet in the air in capsules decorated with characters like The Princess and the Frog and Monsters, Inc.</p><p>We don&#39;t have to spend an exorbitant amount of money to have the Disney experience with our 3-year-old grandchildren. What&#39;s most important is creating the Disney magic with lots of smiles and laughter without dipping too far into our retirement savings.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/we-are-big-disney-adults-but-wont-take-our-grandchildren-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Normally, a baseball-style hat, maybe with a subdued American flag, sunglasses, a collared shirt or tee with a patriotic symbol, technical fabric pants (good in case you need to break into a sprint, Jensen explained), and hiking-style boots.</p><p>Early versions of this operator casual look can be seen in photos from the 1990s, like when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.warhistoryonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2022/09/delta-force-91296-768x509.jpeg\">elite US Delta Force personnel were photographed</a> traveling with Operation Desert Storm leader, US Army General Norman Schwarzkopf, carrying rifles with button-down shirts.</p><p>Before the GWOT, special operations-coded words like &#34;operator&#34; weren&#39;t really part of the general American lexicon, Jensen observed. But after two decades of war and countless movies, books, and TV shows depicting niche SOF cultures, those preferences have seeped into other parts of American life, including into conventional corners of the US military.</p><p>Hegseth did not serve as a special operator, but he is known to enjoy working out with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/SecDef/status/1889211368017957068\">Army Green Berets</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/SecDef/status/1904666001180156103/photo/1\">Navy SEALs</a>.</p><p>Concurrent with the increased cultural popularity of special operations forces, as troops returned from deployments seeking more functional clothes to wear at home or to take on future overseas rotations, many were drawn to the new clothing styles, said Michael Standing, a marketing coordinator for the Zero Foxtrot clothing brand popular with veterans and first responders.</p><p>The demand for a more outdoorsy style, with plentiful pockets and a loose fit to help obscure pistols for concealed carry, arose as US special operations units also drafted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/that-big-military-contractor-patagonia/\">lucrative contracts</a> with brands like Patagonia, Salomon, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/arcteryx-profile\">Arc&#39;teryx</a>.</p><div id=\"1743105145112\" data-styles=\"default-width\" data-embed-type=\"twitter\" data-script=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" class=\"\" data-type=\"embed\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Had the privilege of meeting the outstanding men and women of the 95th Wing on board “The Nightwatch.” Thanks for your dedication and hard work in ensuring the success of our mission as we continue our travels across the Indo-Pacific. <a href=\"https://t.co/VrIbEtyv0y\">pic.twitter.com/VrIbEtyv0y</a></p>&mdash; Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (@SecDef) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecDef/status/1905048321154310483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><h2 id=\"2f899091-63d5-4b68-becc-5ad2318d434d\" data-toc-id=\"2f899091-63d5-4b68-becc-5ad2318d434d\"><strong>A different look</strong></h2><p>Hegseth&#39;s travel look is a notable departure from some of the most recent secretaries. Jim Mattis, Trump&#39;s first defense secretary, was rarely seen in anything but dark formal suits. Leon Panetta dressed down in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/image/427917/secretary-defense-leon-panetta-visits-dagger-brigade-soldiers-iraq\">khakis</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/image/786802/panetta-cambodia\">dress shirts</a> while Ash Carter wore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/image/2530501/secretary-defense-ash-carter-visits-deployed-troops\">dress shirts</a> and<strong> </strong>multiple holsters <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/image/984078/ash-carter-visits-marines-refueling-stop\">for devices</a>.<strong> </strong>And Chuck Hagel favored a country club vibe and grandfatherly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/video/319378/defense-secretary-chuck-hagel-visits-fe-warren-afb-wy\">sweaters</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e6c204b8b41a9673fbffc3?format=jpeg\" height=\"1641\" width=\"2109\" charset=\"\" alt=\"President Barack Obama&#39;s Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel touring Camp Lejeune, N.C., Nov. 18. 2014.\"/><figcaption>President Barack Obama&#39;s Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel touring a military base.<p class=\"copyright\">DoD photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Sean Hurt</p></figcaption></figure><p>One predecessor, though, Gulf War combat veteran Mark Esper,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>was photographed in a casual operator style on several occasions while visiting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/image/4504753/secretary-army-visit\">Iraq</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/image/4507431/us-secretary-army-visits-members-kabul-security-force\">Afghanistan</a> during his time as the US Army secretary.</p><p>While the off-duty operator look has surged in popularity with veterans and first responders over the past two decades, much of Hegseth&#39;s look can probably be chalked up to generational differences between him and his predecessors, said Derek Guy, a menswear expert and author of the blog Die, Workwear.</p><p>As men&#39;s tailored clothing has declined in popularity while technical fabrics become more ubiquitous, a collared, button-front shirt and khaki-adjacent pants can convey a modern professional image, Guy told BI. A polo shirt could also suffice for such official travel, though it might communicate a less rugged image, he said.</p><p>Hegseth is no stranger to tailored clothing, though his tightly fitted and brightly colored suits also distinguish him from other secretaries. But when visiting troops, especially in warm climates, it might make sense that he would gravitate toward a younger look, Guy said.</p><p>&#34;If you&#39;re a 60 or 70-year-old guy, and you&#39;re going out to visit troops, you might still wear a tailored jacket because it is so ingrained in your behavior,&#34; he said. &#34;I think generationally, these different types of men across different age groups have different ideas of what it means to look presentable.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-secdef-pete-hegseths-operator-casual-look-all-about-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

I had a rent-controlled apartment and had saved enough money for a down payment on a home.</p><p>After a while, though, I felt like something was missing. I needed somewhere that would foster my creativity and give me <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moved-from-us-to-scotland-helped-me-realize-true-calling-2025-3\">a new perspective</a>.</p><p>So, at 30, I quit my job and took that money to put toward living in Italy for a year. In that <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moved-to-italy-twice-what-did-differently-second-time-2025-3\">one year in Florence</a>, I learned more about myself and my self-worth than I&#39;d learned in my entire life up to that point.</p><h2 id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\" data-toc-id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">My friends and family didn&#39;t understand but I knew taking a gap year at 30 was right for me</h2><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">The reality was that <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-single-tired-of-dating-apps-alternative-2025-3\">I was single</a> and had an unexplained drive to explore myself more before committing to a person or a place.</p><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">More of my friends were getting married and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-get-my-husband-see-having-kids-isnt-about-cost-2025-3\">having kids</a>, but I wasn&#39;t ready for that. A part of me was afraid to move to a new country, knowing it would only make relating with them harder, but I ultimately chose to do what was best for me.</p><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">My parents, who had taken the classic trajectory of marriage, kids, and buying a house, definitely didn&#39;t understand it. Some friends shared their concerns about what I would be gaining from this.</p><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">To me, though, I had saved almost $40,000 and I had every right to choose how to use it. I hope my story sheds light on the idea that taking a gap year at 30 should not be frowned upon and doesn&#39;t have to be scary.</p><h2 id=\"0a170c10-d098-4d79-bec2-dd5a98cd6809\" data-toc-id=\"0a170c10-d098-4d79-bec2-dd5a98cd6809\">How I found my community in Florence</h2><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">I knew no one in Italy at the time, but I found an apartment in Florence and a side hustle writing music to keep me structured and afloat (I even managed to salvage a portion of my savings when I returned home).</p><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">When I first arrived, I was very ambitious. I visited seven countries within the first six weeks. Although I wouldn&#39;t change these experiences, I realize now that I quickly <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tourist-solo-travel-36-flights-mistakes-caused-burnout-2024-9\">burned myself out</a>.</p><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">I was so focused on making this time count and checking off places from my bucket list that I forgot to enjoy the luxury of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moving-to-italy-struggle-at-first-made-me-better-mom-2025-3\">calling Italy my home</a>. I needed to slow down.</p><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">I joined some Facebook groups for nomads in Florence. At a happy hour for Girls Gone International, I met what would soon be my five close girlfriends. They were all like me: single, 30, and giving up a stable life to experience something greater within the world.</p><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">It felt so good to be around like-minded people. It also helped me find comfort in the times when I questioned the decisions that got me to Florence.</p><p id=\"99b5f060-612b-4b0a-ab4e-0301f65234a3\">With a community in place, I started slowing down on my travels and diving into Italian culture. I joined a creative writing program where I met writers with endless ideas. It helped boost my self-confidence in my own writing, and through that, I was able to reinvent myself into a better, more balanced version of myself.</p><p>I also started taking Italian classes with a private tutor, and before I knew it, I was able to hold my own when ordering at a restaurant or conversing with Italians at a bar. I was creating, speaking the language, and walking the streets of Florence without a map.</p><p>Eventually, I started seeing myself as a part of the world, instead of someone looking at it. The Italian phrase, &#34;ricominciare da zero&#34; (meaning &#34;to start from the beginning&#34;) became my motto.</p><h2 id=\"6fb2351a-6fd6-48e9-a5a3-e69b0ed06161\" data-toc-id=\"6fb2351a-6fd6-48e9-a5a3-e69b0ed06161\">I found the new perspective I was searching for</h2><p>I returned to the States in October, but instead of going back to what I knew in San Francisco, I took another leap into the unknown and moved to New York City.</p><p>I&#39;d never felt ready for New York before. In Italy, however, I&#39;d gained confidence, which made me feel fearless in taking the next step in my creative endeavors.</p><p>Living in an artist-driven city like Florence and meeting a community of writers who both supported and inspired my work changed the game for me.</p><p>Since returning to the US and living in New York, I&#39;ve written and edited my first poetry book and am supporting myself as a successful freelance writer. If I hadn&#39;t moved to Italy, I might not have become this version of myself.</p><p>The experience felt priceless, and I continue to stay in touch with the friends I made in Florence. Looking back, I would spend the money again the same way. In fact, I&#39;m now saving up to buy a Tuscan villa to host creative writing workshops in Italy.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-my-job-took-a-gap-year-in-italy-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Musicians by trade. We just took a wrong turn one day and were obliged to stay,&#34; Lucy Gray said. She explained they were from &#34;no district in particular&#34; and used to &#34;move from place to place&#34; playing music before Peacekeepers forced them to stay in District 12 following the first rebellion.</p><p id=\"2c57a972-34a2-4406-9bf9-4eea2645d99f\">At the start of &#34;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,&#34; there are six living members of the Covey family living in District 12: Billy Taupe Clade, Clerk Carmine Clade, Tam Amber, Maude Ivory Baird, Barb Azure Baird, and Lucy Gray Baird.</p><p id=\"2c57a972-34a2-4406-9bf9-4eea2645d99f\">Billy Taupe and Clerk Carmine are brothers, and Maude Ivory, Barb Azure, and Lucy Gray are cousins.

Even if she survived her final encounter with Coriolanus at the end of &#34;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,&#34; it&#39;s unlikely that Lucy Gray was in District 12 when Lenore Dove came into the world, as she would have run off to live out her days in the wilderness for safety.</p><p id=\"467daf91-bbc5-4afb-bec9-2886725fd1c9\">Lucy Gray&#39;s grave is also described as &#34;a mossy slab of stone,&#34; while Maude Ivory&#39;s is &#34;a creamy white stone,&#34; making Maude Ivory&#39;s seem slightly newer.</p><p id=\"467daf91-bbc5-4afb-bec9-2886725fd1c9\">Readers can infer from Lenore Dove&#39;s age and the timeline the graves suggest that Maude Ivory was Lenore Dove&#39;s mother, not Lucy Gray.</p><h2 id=\"fc907fab-bc38-48fb-8c6e-4fbdf2030a36\" data-toc-id=\"fc907fab-bc38-48fb-8c6e-4fbdf2030a36\">Katniss is a Covey descendant</h2><p id=\"fc907fab-bc38-48fb-8c6e-4fbdf2030a36\">In &#34;Sunrise on the Reaping,&#34; Haymitch says he meets Lenore Dove through his friend Burdock Everdeen, Katniss&#39; father.</p><p id=\"fc907fab-bc38-48fb-8c6e-4fbdf2030a36\">&#34;She wasn&#39;t one of Burdock&#39;s Everdeen cousins, but I knew he had some distant ones on his ma&#39;s side,&#34; Haymitch says of Burdock&#39;s ancestry.</p><p id=\"fc907fab-bc38-48fb-8c6e-4fbdf2030a36\">Because of Muade Ivory and Lucy Gray&#39;s fates, Burdock&#39;s mother seems to be Barb Azure Baird.

In other words, it comes down to how easily users can navigate the app.</p><p>McKinnon said Signal could add or tweak some features to make it easier to use &mdash; like displaying more than just a contact&#39;s initials as an icon. The CEO said &#34;there&#39;s many JGs,&#34; referencing the initials of Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was mistakenly added to the group chat. McKinnon said the platform could also somehow try to show who the person was so they wouldn&#39;t accidentally land on the CCd list.</p><p>The reality is that encrypted messaging platforms like Signal can still be undermined by usability challenges &mdash; and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/signal-government-chat-screw-up-at-work-own-it-hegseth-2025-3\">when people send messages quickly</a>, &#34;that leads to mistakes,&#34; he said. McKinnon added that when companies get hacked, it&#39;s often &#34;the simple stuff&#34; that leads to it.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s some account that&#39;s left open or has the default password, or some account doesn&#39;t have multi-factor authentication,&#34; McKinnon said.</p><p>Signal <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://x.com/signalapp/status/1904666111989166408\">wrote</a> in an X post on Tuesday that there has been &#34;misinfo flying around&#34; that could deter users. The company cited an NPR report that said it obtained a Pentagon warning on March 18 about a potential vulnerability on Signal. Signal said in the post that the &#34;vulnerability&#34; didn&#39;t have anything to do with Signal&#39;s &#34;core tech&#34; and was a warning for phishing scams targeting the app&#39;s users.</p><p>&#34;Signal is open source, so our code is regularly scrutinized in addition to regular formal audits,&#34; the company added in the post.</p><p>McKinnon added that an app like Signal has to run on a phone or computer, and if that device isn&#39;t secure, the messaging app can&#39;t fully be either. McKinnon said that&#39;s often the issue in cyber-related incidents.</p><p>&#34;Ultimately, an end-to-end encrypted messaging app is only as secure as the endpoints that are hosting it,&#34; McKinnon, who runs the leading cloud-based identity verification platform, said.</p><p>The CEO also said while Signal may be encrypted, there&#39;s challenges around deciding &#34;how accessible a piece of information should be.&#34; McKinnon said companies often make things too accessible and struggle to decide what data should be narrowly or broadly accessible.</p><p>McKinnon said the &#34;one size fits all&#34; approach usually doesn&#39;t work out either, because that would probably mean no one, or very few people, can access anything &mdash; which means people will likely end up going around it.</p><p>McKinnon&#39;s comments come after Goldberg was accidentally added to a Signal group chat called &#34;Houthi PC small group.&#34; The chat was primarily made up of senior US officials, and its participants, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/marco-rubio-announces-official-end-of-most-usaid-programs-2025-3\"><u>Marco Rubio</u></a>, were discussing <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-orders-airstrikes-in-yemen-2025-3\"><u>strikes on Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels</u></a>.</p><p>Signal did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/oktas-ceo-signal-group-chat-snafu-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

They said the ministry is &#34;in the early stages&#34; of reviewing the current F-35 process &#34;in a way that is both efficient and thorough.&#34;</p><p>Last week, the chairman of Denmark&#39;s parliamentary defense committee <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/denmark-f35-regret-choosing-defense-committee-chairman-tensions-us-greenland-2025-3\">said he regretted buying</a> the F-35, citing concerns that the US State Department could abruptly block spare parts needed to maintain the aircraft. He said purchasing American weapons is now &#34;a security risk.&#34;</p><p>The country&#39;s defense ministry told BI that &#34;any limitations in the use of Danish F-35 aircraft are classified information, but Denmark is still open to buying additional F-35 aircraft in the future.&#34;</p><p>Denmark, like Canada, is an original <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/test-pilot-shares-experience-flying-f-16-and-f-35-2025-2\">F-35 program participant</a>. The fifth-gen aircraft has also been sold to another dozen countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Since the first F-35 rolled off the factory floor nearly two decades ago, over 1,100 jets have been delivered to allied and partner militaries.</p><p>Three other F-35 program participants, specifically the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands, voiced their continued support for this program.</p><p>The Dutch defense ministry told BI that there&#39;s &#34;no reason to assume that the good cooperation with the US in the F-35 program will change or stop,&#34; and a spokesperson for the Australian defense ministry said that it is &#34;committed to continued investment&#34; in the F-35.</p><p>Other allies, like Germany, have also reiterated their support for the program, even amid lingering uncertainty. A spokesperson for Poland&#39;s defense ministry told BI that its F-35 program &#34;is being implemented according to schedule. Currently, there are no decisions on the possible termination of the agreements signed with the American side.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"e1f30200-ece9-49b8-b883-00fad81c6e19\" data-toc-id=\"e1f30200-ece9-49b8-b883-00fad81c6e19\"><strong>Questioning alliances</strong></h2><p>NATO allies have not yet made any firm decisions to pull the plug on more F-35 procurement, but unease has replaced a once certain confidence. Analysts and experts say that US allies may be justifiably concerned about the potential leverage the Trump administration could have over them.</p><p>There&#39;s no kill switch or anything like that for the jets, but the US provides critical additional support for its weapons that makes them effective. American-led maintenance and supply chains, as well as networks and planning support, are essential to the program.

That&#39;s not great for the F-35 program.</p><p>The jet has faced criticism, including from the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk, for design issues, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-f-35-jet-makers-need-tackle-cost-readiness-concerns-2025-2\">program costs, and persistent sustainability challenges</a>.

That one came out of left field, and it was a shock.</p><h2 id=\"33559730-2830-40be-9791-a528751cb5e9\" data-toc-id=\"33559730-2830-40be-9791-a528751cb5e9\">I was surprised at the office I was assigned to</h2><p>I&#39;d been looking in my agency&#39;s facilities resources, and they have these cool occupant guides that tell you everything you need to know about each one of their facilities. They didn&#39;t have one for this office. There was barely anything about it on my agency&#39;s internal website.</p><p>That area is home to a lot of industrial parks. There are some residents who live there, but it&#39;s largely office parks and factories. The only time I&#39;d been here previously was to pick up something at a UPS center.</p><p>The nearest place to get lunch is the better part of a half-mile walk up the road to your choice of Mexican restaurants. No shade, I love Mexican &mdash; it&#39;s my favorite non-steak and potatoes cuisine.</p><p>At any rate, I showed up there on the Monday and I&#39;m in a room with 10 other people who had their remote agreements terminated. There were people who used to work at the Chicago district office, there were people who have been remote for over 10 years, and there was me.</p><p>When we first got here, they hadn&#39;t cleared out offices for us, and they hadn&#39;t moved staff to other offices. They had to move people to accommodate us because this facility simply isn&#39;t built for this many employees, I guess.</p><h2 id=\"444bc092-126a-4b2b-b55a-0638453d2565\" data-toc-id=\"444bc092-126a-4b2b-b55a-0638453d2565\">The RTO process felt a bit rushed and mean</h2><p>The speed of the return was, I want to say, intentional cruelty.</p><p>Still, the staff who manage the facilities have done their best to minimize the impact of that cruelty.</p><p>The people who made the decisions and the schedule on the return to office had almost no consideration for the space and administrative services people who actually handle the facilities. Those people have done heroic lifting in trying to make this all work. They shouldn&#39;t have had to move mountains on the schedule that they did.</p><p>Some of that was consistent with the Russell Vought quote about <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBH9TmeJN_M\">terrorizing us as federal employees</a>. It&#39;s one thing for a private citizen to want to terrorize us. It&#39;s another for the director of the Office of Management and Budget to want to do it.</p><h2 id=\"8b3fa640-1827-43a6-9a9d-77a51d38e3e4\" data-toc-id=\"8b3fa640-1827-43a6-9a9d-77a51d38e3e4\">My commute is tricky &mdash; it&#39;s 42 stops if I take public transit</h2><p>Getting here by public transit is very complicated. I haven&#39;t actually done it yet; I&#39;ve been getting a ride from my wife.</p><p>I&#39;m going to be busing when she goes back to work, but fortunately for me, she&#39;s not going to work right now.</p><p>It&#39;s six miles to my office, and then she has eight miles to her work &mdash; but this is all rush hour on city streets. It&#39;s about 25 minutes to get to my office if we leave early. It&#39;s going to take what was her 40-minute commute and make it over well over an hour.</p><p>To my office, it would be 42 stops on one bus and then a mile-and-a-quarter walk that involves going under a highway underpass. It&#39;s not the greatest walk.</p><p>In an ideal world, you can do it in an hour and five minutes. In the real world, I don&#39;t even know. If you miss one of the long buses, that&#39;s an extra 23 minutes while you&#39;re waiting for the next bus.</p><p>Going to the downtown office would have taken about 45 minutes &mdash; nine stops on the train. You miss a Chicago Transit Authority train, and it&#39;s only another five to seven minutes during rush hour. It&#39;s not a big deal.</p><p>It&#39;s $4 a day to take public transit, paid by the taxpayer due to the provisions of the Clean Air Incentives Act. While it&#39;s still intact, federal employees get subsidies if they take public transit.</p><p>If I drove, the car maintenance, gas, and total cost and depreciation would be all on me. Still, if I were here long-term and I knew I had certainty in my job, I would buy a second car.</p><h2 id=\"8a63b98f-104f-4825-abd3-95bfb2105e43\" data-toc-id=\"8a63b98f-104f-4825-abd3-95bfb2105e43\">I don&#39;t work with anyone else in the office</h2><p>The people who RTO-ed were assigned to a conference room for a few days while we sorted things out. </p><p>We were all a little gobsmacked about being there. We&#39;re 10 randos thrown together from random divisions in a company.</p><p>None of us work together. None of us are from the same division. None of us have anything in common other than locality and having been remote.</p><p>There is almost no synergistic benefit to the American taxpayer or the government to have us stationed here in addition to the regular staff already stationed here.</p><p>We&#39;re a bunch of spreadsheet monkeys who could maybe show each other neat tricks in Excel. Otherwise, there&#39;s no knowledge transfer. There&#39;s no collaboration. We&#39;re not like a normal office as people would understand it.</p><p>Most of the people I work with are in Maryland.</p><p>When people return to the office, even at a large company that has maybe 10 sites or something, the people who are thrown back into the office generally work together. They generally sit together and maybe go to lunch together.</p><p>That&#39;s not what&#39;s happening here.</p><p>This is people from disparate parts of a big agency being thrown back together in whatever the nearest facility was regardless of what they do. There&#39;s no search for synergy in the return to office, at least from my experience.</p><p>We&#39;re commiserating. We&#39;re doing our best to support each other.</p><p>That was something that I thought would happen with return to work in general &mdash; that people would find other people, we would have some mutual solidarity and support, and we would be there for what I call a good water cooler session.</p><p>Even though we don&#39;t have a water cooler, we can still stand around and chat. That&#39;s something that just helps the morale and helps you get through the day.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-worker-rto-felt-rushed-long-commute-team-not-there-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, have rallied behind liberal Judge Susan Crawford.</p><p>More than $80 million has been spent, making the contest the costliest judicial election in US history &mdash; supplanting a Wisconsin court from just two years ago.</p><p>&#34;Both sides are making a pitch to make it a referendum on Donald Trump or Elon Musk as the case may be,&#34; Marquette Law School professor Chad Oldfather told Business Insider. &#34;It&#39;s kind of the first election of consequence in the Trump era, so I think people are looking for signs here as to how the population is reacting to everything.&#34;</p><p>Oldfather, who studies state constitutional law, said Musk&#39;s presence has given this race a different feel.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve had outside money coming into these races in the past, I suppose what distinguishes it is that Musk is not trying to downplay his role at all,&#34; Oldfather said.</p><p>Tesla is suing to open dealerships in the state, fighting a state law that doesn&#39;t allow automakers to sell directly to consumers. (<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-electric-vehicle-sales-model-automakers-say-wont-catch-on-2023-8\">It&#39;s a frequent issue for Musk&#39;s company</a>.) Musk and just about every other major figure who has weighed in on the race is more concerned about what the seven justices can do that will have national effects.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re trying to stop the Democrats in Wisconsin from removing two House seats,&#34; Musk told Fox News anchor Bret Baier during an interview for &#34;Special Report.&#34;</p><p>If Schimel loses, Musk said, &#34;we could lose control of the House and all of the government reforms could be shut down.&#34;</p><p>The GOP holds a 6 to 2 majority in the Wisconsin US House of Representatives delegation. History shows that the president&#39;s party typically loses seats. The GOP has a slim House majority, meaning it cannot afford to see more districts become more competitive.</p><h2 id=\"08714f67-f9ed-451d-99a6-b7dab2caa928\" data-toc-id=\"08714f67-f9ed-451d-99a6-b7dab2caa928\">Musk isn&#39;t hard to miss in the state.</h2><p>Crawford and her allies have repeatedly highlighted Musk&#39;s spending in the race. Wisconsin Democrats&#39; website has a splash page that shows Musk as the puppet master of Schimel.</p><p>&#34;Elon Musk is the most unpopular active national figure in Wisconsin politics, and the more voters see that the man who is attacking social security and their healthcare is pouring millions of dollars in to help Brad Schimel, the more voters are enraged about the idea of someone trying to buy our state Supreme Court,&#34; Wisconsin Democrats Chairman Ben Wikler told Business Insider.</p><p>After Musk announced his initial giveaway, Crawford&#39;s campaign wrote on X, &#34;Brad Schimel and Elon Musk are corrupt.&#34;</p><p>In response to Crawford, Schimel&#39;s campaign said their opponent has plenty of well-heeled supporters herself, including George Soros, Bernie Sanders, and Hakeem Jeffries.</p><p><strong>&#34;</strong>The attempts by Susan Crawford and the Democrats to distract the people of Wisconsin from her extreme views and the radical billionaires funding her are a mockery of hypocrisy,&#34; Jacob Fischer, Schimel campaign spokesperson, said in a statement to Business Insider.</p><p>Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming called the focus on Musk&#39;s spending &#34;a diversion.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a way for them to take shots at Donald Trump and at Elon Musk,&#34; Schimming told Business Insider. &#34;There&#39;s no lack of lack of big money people that have come into Wisconsin over the years that have greatly outspent Elon Musk.&#34;</p><p>According to a March 5 Marquette Law School Poll, Musk has a -12 percentage point approval rating in Wisconsin. The same respondents only slightly disapproved (-3 percentage points) of Trump&#39;s first six weeks in office. Trump won the state last November, part of his swing state sweep over Vice President Kamala Harris that ushered him back into the White House. Just days before Election Day, Trump announced his endorsement of Schimel.</p><p>Like in the 2024 election, Musk&#39;s campaigning is also drawing opposition. On Friday, he wrote on X that he would personally award two voters $1 million checks at the Sunday rally. He then deleted the tweet and later clarified that the checks were for attendees who had agreed to become spokespeople for a petition America PAC is pushing across the state. Musk&#39;s political outfit previously promised to give $100 to voters who signed the petition against judicial activism.</p><p>Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, said he would challenge Musk&#39;s giveaway in court. Wisconsin law prohibits anyone from giving &#34;something of value&#34; to voters, which led some election law experts to conclude that Musk&#39;s effort was illegal.</p><p>The national attention is unlikely to fade for long.</p><p>Wisconsin justices serve 10-year terms. Due to retirements alone, the state will hold multiple Supreme Court elections over the next five years. In the meantime, the current race seems almost inescapable, Oldfather said.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a deluge,&#34; he said, &#34;every time you turn on the TV, every time you pull up YouTube, every you open your mailbox, every time your phone dings with a text message.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-wisconsin-state-supreme-court-election-analysis-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Some applicants hold Ivy League degrees. Dayton said one &#34;friendly acquaintance&#34; contacted her through LinkedIn to ensure her niece&#39;s application for the six-week program would be seen.</p><p>Dayton said Spot &amp; Tango employees, which include about 50 people at its New York corporate office, have been getting &#34;nonstop&#34; texts and emails asking whether the job is real.

Min Aung Hlaing, the SAC’s chief, in a televised address.</p>\n<p>With more than 1,000 fatalities, thousands more people injured and numerous collapsed buildings in Mandalay, there is concern about how the military government handles such a severe national disaster and how the opposition responds.</p>\n\n<p>In the 24 hours after the quake both sides expressed concern for the victims and the need for international aid. But neither mentioned the need for a ceasefire in a conflict that has intensified markedly in the past two years.</p>\n<p>Earlier military governments sought to cover up natural disasters. When Cyclone Nargis devastated the Irrawaddy Delta in Myanmar’s southwest in May 2008, killing some 140,000 people, the ruling State Peace and Development Council, a predecessor to the SAC, was&nbsp;at first<strong>&nbsp;</strong>extremely resistant to offers of humanitarian assistance from ASEAN countries, and rejected outright help from the U.S. naval forces that were on hand and well supplied.</p>\n<p>The military’s initial response to the earthquake was not promising. Hours after the disaster, there were reports of aerial strikes on civilian areas not far from the epicenter in Sagaing, and on Saturday several opposition groups reported ongoing attacks by military forces.</p>\n<p>“The regime’s stated openness to international aid will be tested repeatedly and in concrete ways over the coming days and weeks, and tenacious diplomacy may be needed,” Richard Horsey, Crisis Group’s senior adviser for Myanmar, told Nikkei Asia. “But we should not assume that aid delivery — in an equitable, needs-based way — will not be possible.</p>\n<p>“Min Aung Hlaing has likely learned from the SPDC’s extremely slow response to Cyclone Nargis in 2008 — only belatedly allowing international aid, and not traveling personally to the affected area for weeks.</p>\n<p>“In this case, the affected area includes the capital Naypyitaw. This means that the regime has more to lose from a botched response, which will be visible to the elite and impact people in core areas. This disaster is very much not out of sight, out of mind for the regime.”</p>\n<p>Analysts say Min Aung Hlaing’s openness to aid and willingness to be seen visiting quake-hit areas shows he recognizes the benefits he can gain from the tragedy.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious that the SAC is going to milk this for all it’s worth,” Anthony Davis, an analyst with the Janes defense and security group, told Nikkei. “Min Aung Hlaing’s quite striking appeal for international help from any country, any organization, means any assistance is of course going to have to come through the regime. So this will play strongly into the regime’s overall strategy to gain international legitimacy.”</p>\n<p>Myanmar regime officials on Saturday posed proudly for photographs with Indian government personnel delivering aid at Yangon airport.</p>\n<p>United Nations agencies like the World Food Program, the U.N. Development Program and Unicef, which focuses on children, have often faced criticism for operating in SAC-controlled areas, although much of the population is struggling to feed itself. One in four people already face “acute food insecurity,” according to WFP.</p>\n<p>As India, China and the U.N. begin to mobilize assistance, access to victims is going to be key. Myanmar’s military has full control of less than half the country, and virtually none of the national borders with Bangladesh, China, India, Laos and Thailand. It controls all the national seaports and airports — although the airports at the capital Naypyitaw and Mandalay have been closed as a result of the quake.</p>\n<p>“I do think there is an opportunity for people’s defense forces operating and holding territory in central Myanmar to reach out and offer assistance in SAC-held areas,” a veteran regional observer who declined to be identified told Nikkei.</p>\n<p>The parallel and opposition National Unity Government founded by ousted members of parliament in 2021 has influence over armed opposition forces professing a democratic agenda. But others among more than a dozen insurgent groups often appear more intent on securing territory and natural resources.</p>\n<p>“The majority of the affected areas fall within the territories under the control of the National Unity Government,” said NUG-appointed Prime Minister Mahn Win Khaing Thet in a Facebook address. “We have issued directives to all relevant government officials to ensure that emergency assistance and rehabilitation efforts are made for all affected individuals and families, regardless of ethnicity or religion.</p>\n<p>“We earnestly appeal to the international community … to extend humanitarian assistance.” The shadow prime minister spoke of achieving bonds of solidarity, revolutionary aspirations and compassion, but not of a ceasefire or workable distribution logistics.</p>\n<p>“Ceasefires will be needed on all sides,” Laetitia van den Assum, a retired Dutch diplomat who follows Myanmar closely, told Nikkei. “The first condition to the SAC should be the total ban of the despicable air strikes on the civilian population.</p>\n<p>“This is also a time for donors who really care to ditch the failed traditional state-centric approach which accepts that all relations go via the center. It will make matters worse. The UN has consistently accepted Naypyitaw’s insistence on centralization. Under the current situation, that will only lead to more victims and a strengthening of the SAC’s role.”</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

The island was returned to Japanese sovereignty in 1968.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Hegseth will meet with Nakatani in Tokyo to discuss measures to beef up the alliance’s deterrence. He will also hold talks with Ishiba the same day.</p>\n<p>Just days before, Japan launched a new command under which the Self-Defense Forces are to better integrate their ground, maritime and air units, a major revamp aimed at ensuring smoother coordination with the U.S. military as tensions rise along the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n<p>Under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, the U.S. government decided to upgrade U.S. Forces Japan, which will serve as a key counterpart for the SDF Joint Operations Command.</p>\n<p>However, recent U.S. media reports have said the Pentagon is considering halting the planned expansion of USFJ as part of cost-cutting efforts.</p>\n<p>Hegseth could call on Japan to ramp up its defense budget, even though it decided in 2022 to increase related spending to 2 percent of its gross domestic product by fiscal 2027, a significant shift in postwar security policy under its war-renouncing Constitution.</p>\n<p>Hegseth’s trip began on Monday and has included stopovers in Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines, another key U.S. ally in Asia.</p>\n<p>During the trip, he has been dogged by questions about a scandal related to the sharing of highly sensitive attack plans with a journalist on a commercial messaging app. He and other high-ranking Trump administration officials have faced criticism for their roles in the security breach.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

At a meeting with Mandalay regional government officials, the general reportedly “instructed them to carry out search and rescue operations as soon as possible and to take necessary measures.”</p>\n<p>Relief efforts in Myanmar are being hampered by a lack of power in Mandalay, and the largest city, Yangon, and the civil war that has erupted since the military seized power in 2021. Some of the affected areas are controlled by the regime and some by opposition groups.</p>\n<p>The authorities said electricity in Yangon would be limited to four hours a day beginning Saturday.</p>\n<p>One man in Mandalay told Nikkei Asia many people were still too afraid to return to their homes. Minor aftershocks were reported during the night.</p>\n<p>China’s embassy in Myanmar announced a team of 37 rescue workers had flown to Yangon, the country’s biggest city, and it would “head to Naypyitaw, where the damage has been extensive.”</p>\n<p>“It is the first international rescue team to arrive in Myanmar within 18 hours of the earthquake, demonstrating the China-Myanmar Pauk Paw friendship and shared community spirit,” the embassy said.</p>\n<p>Indian external affairs minister S. Jaishankar wrote on X that India had dispatched a first tranche of aid to Myanmar that included blankets, tarpaulins, hygiene kits, sleeping bags, solar lamps, food packets and kitchen sets. Rescue and medical teams were sent on the same flight, he added</p>\n<p>The United Nations emergency relief coordinator made an initial allocation of $5 million for recovery efforts. “The earthquake will compound an already dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar, where nearly 20 million people need assistance across the country, including more than 3.5 million people displaced from their homes,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.</p>\n<p>Western countries have largely cut off relations with Myanmar but the European Commission announced the EU was “releasing 2.5 million euros ($2.3 million) in initial emergency assistance,” a statement says. “The Commission, together with our humanitarian partners, is assessing the situation and [the] needs on the ground, in order to mobilise further EU assistance.”</p>\n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. was ready to send relief assistance to Myanmar but did not give any details.</p>\n<p>Authorities in Thailand on Saturday appealed for help to rescue 96 people still missing after a partially built State Audit Office tower block collapsed in Bangkok. Eight people have been confirmed dead at that site, according to officials there, and four elsewhere in the city.</p>\n<p>Many of the people who had been building the tower block came from Myanmar. Moe Kyaw Aung, who works on a different project in Bangkok, told Nikkei Asia that his cousin, Aung Ye Soe, and three of his friends, all from Myanmar, had been working above the 20th floor of the building on Friday. All are missing in the rubble.</p>\n<p>“He’s like my blood brother,” Moe Kyaw Aung said tearfully at the site, where rescue efforts were continuing on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Rescuers are currently trying to reach five or six survivors in a cluster near the front of the site. But the effort is slow-going as Thai authorities are inexperienced in earthquake disasters, and asked for help and expertise from other countries like Japan.</p>    <div class=\"ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F5%2F1%2F8%2F5%2F49255815-1-eng-GB%2F20250329+Bangkok+rescue.JPG?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Rescuers huddle at the site of a partially built tower block in Bangkok that collapsed during the earthquake on March 28.

The lawsuit challenged a policy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently adopted that is aimed at fast-tracking the deportations of thousands of migrants who had been released from detention.</p>\n<p>That Feb. 18 directive instructs officers to review all cases of all such individuals, including those who had complied with the terms of their release, for re-detention and removal to a third country.</p>\n<p>Lawyers for the migrants argued the policy exposed an untold number of people to the risk of deportation to countries where they might face danger without providing them any notice or opportunity to present a fear-based claim.</p>\n<p>Murphy, an appointee of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, noted that under the Convention Against Torture, migrants had protections against being removed to countries where they face a likelihood of torture.</p>\n<p>“If your position today is that we don’t have to give them any notice, and we can send them to any country other than the country to which the immigration court has said no, that’s a very surprising thing to hear the government say,” he told a Justice Department attorney.</p>\n<p>He barred the administration from deporting any individual from the United States to a country other than the one designated for removal in immigration proceedings without providing them written notice and a “meaningful opportunity” to submit a fear-based claim.</p>\n<p>“We’re relieved the judge saw the urgency of this situation both for our named plaintiffs and other similarly situated individuals,” said Trina Realmuto, a lawyer for the migrants at the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

Where can we find Greenland on the map?” the teacher asked the class.</p>\n\n<p>The island’s coordinates were used to show how maps and the Global Positioning System work. All lessons at the school are conducted in English, and there are no textbooks.</p>\n<p>At GIIS Tokyo, which has adopted the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum, there are no divisions between subjects like language and mathematics as there are at Japanese schools. Classes proceed based on themes for each grade level such as “the time and place we live in” and “ways to express ourselves.” A single lesson can include both numerical tasks and geographical knowledge.</p>\n<p>Students express thoughts about words they hear in the news every day, like tariffs. Priyanga Shimada, a teacher at GIIS, said the school does not teach in a way that only seeks correct answers, because in the real world, there frequently are no correct answers.</p>\n<p>While many students are of Indian descent, there are also Japanese and Chinese students.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F4%2F9%2F1%2F7%2F49197194-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-1742334578photo_SXM2025030300010664.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             GIIS students take part in a memorial service for&nbsp;Mahatma Gandhi in Tokyo.&nbsp;(Photo by Natsumi Kawasaki)&nbsp;                       </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>GIIS Tokyo, which opened in 2014, was originally established for the children of Indian professionals working in Japan. With the school’s introduction of the IB curriculum in 2017, the number of Japanese applicants grew, and the campuses increased from one to four.</p>\n<p>Japanese students surpassed Indian students in fiscal 2021 and accounted for 55% of the total, at 780, in fiscal 2024.</p>\n<p>There is also an Indian curriculum that follows traditional Indian schools, and at that campus, 20% to 30% of the students are Japanese. GIIS Tokyo students start with the Indian curriculum in lower grades and then move on to the IB in the upper grades if they so choose.</p>\n<p>Entrance exams test English and math skills from preschool, with science included from sixth grade on. The registration fee for the school is 40,000 yen ($270) and tuition for elementary school students runs from 1.2 million yen to 1.59 million yen a year.</p>\n<p>The British School in Tokyo, by comparison, charges tuition for seven- to nine-year-olds of 2.73 million yen.</p>\n<p>Long-established European and American international schools in Japan typically cater to the children of diplomats and corporate executives. These include Tokyo’s American School in Japan, founded in 1902, and Kobe’s Canadian Academy, established in 1923. Many parents choose those schools because they provide networking opportunities that can help their children after graduation.</p>\n<p>As more foreigners arrive and more Japanese families seek education with international standards, many international schools that offer IB are opening in Japan. GIIS Tokyo is leading the charge on lower prices.</p>\n<p>GIIS has 64 schools in Japan, Southeast Asia and elsewhere, according to GIIS Tokyo senior principal Madhu Khanna. Tuition fees can be kept low because budgets are allocated flexibly.</p>\n<p>The schools are also known for teaching Indian-style arithmetic, which involves solving complex calculations in one’s head, and many parents send children there with the hopes of improving their science, math and IT education.</p>\n<p>Madhu said GIIS’s practical IT education, involving artificial intelligence and robotics, is highly regarded. “The school wants to raise future-ready citizens, ” Madhu said.</p>\n<p>GIIS Tokyo is also active in the community. Volunteers regularly water flowers in the local park. On Jan. 30, a memorial service was held on the anniversary of the death of Mahatma Gandhi, attended by the Indian ambassador to Japan and the mayor of Edogawa ward, during which students participated in a choral performance.</p>\n<p>The rise of Indian international schools in Japan began around 2000, when internet services expanded in the country. IT engineers went from being sent on business trips from India on a project-by-project basis to being fully based in Japan, and people moving there with their families increased. There was a growing demand for the same educational curriculum as in India so children could return to their home school system seamlessly.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F1%2F9%2F5%2F6%2F49196591-1-eng-GB%2Fphoto_SXM2025020400005388.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Jagmohan S.

But because warehouses were full, he decided to relocate to Nishi-Kasai, a new warehouse district in Edogawa. This marked the first step toward Nishi-Kasai’s transformation into Tokyo’s “Little India.”</p>\n<p>Chandrani was unable to find educational opportunities that would expose his children to Indian culture, so he ended up sending them to boarding school in his home country. As he helped other Indians adjust to life in Japan, many came to him about educating their children.</p>\n<p>Edogawa was home to 7,484 Indians as of Jan. 1, amounting to 40% of the Indians living in Tokyo. The population has grown nearly fortyfold over 25 years.</p>\n<p>The Indian population will continue to grow here, said Chandrani.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

Much of the deal’s specifics remained unclear, such as how investors might be compensated, how X’s leaders would be integrated, or the prospect of regulatory scrutiny.</p>\n<p>“This development feels surprising and somewhat unexpected,” PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said. “To a certain extent, it closes a chapter in the turbulent saga of X.”</p>\n<p>“The choice of $45 billion is not a coincidence,” said D.A. Davidson &amp; Co. analyst Gil Luria. “It is $1 billion higher than the take-private transaction for Twitter in 2022” and he can share the value of the xAI business with Twitter co-investors.</p>\n<p>Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, has also consolidated his power in Washington by overseeing the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). That has also put him in a position to potentially influence agencies that oversee his business dealings.</p>\n<p>An investor in xAI, and now in the combined entity, told Reuters they were not surprised by the deal, viewing it as Musk consolidating his leadership and management at his own companies. The investor declined to be named.</p>\n<p>Musk did not ask investors for approval but told them that the two companies had been collaborating closely and the integration would drive deeper integration with Grok.</p>\n<p>Musk’s xAI startup was launched less than two years ago and recently raised $10 billion in a funding round that valued the company at $75 billion, according to a media report.</p>\n<p>In February, Musk, 53, made a $97.4 billion bid with a consortium for the ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which was rejected, with OpenAI saying that the startup was not for sale. Musk co-founded OpenAI with CEO Sam Altman in 2015.</p>\n<p>Musk competes directly with the popular OpenAI platform and has sued in federal court in California to prevent his rival from converting from a non-profit to a for-profit business. A judge earlier this month denied Musk’s request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the changeover.</p>\n<p>The wide release of AI software has set off a flurry of investment and competition in Silicon Valley. To be more efficient companies are seeking ways to integrate the software into nearly every part of their operations.</p>\n<p>As competition in AI intensifies, xAI has been ramping up its data center capacity to train more advanced models. Its supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, called “Colossus,” is touted as the largest in the world.</p>\n<p>xAI introduced Grok-3, the latest iteration of its chatbot, in February, as it takes on China’s DeepSeek and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. The X platform can serve to further distribute xAI products, while also providing a real-time feed of users’ musings, screenshots and other data.</p>\n<p>Musk clinched a deal in 2022 to buy Twitter for $44 billion, ending its run as a public company since its 2013 initial public offering, declaring that “the bird is freed” once the acquisition closed.</p>\n<p>He gutted the company’s workforce after the acquisition, prompting advertisers to flee the platform and a rapid decline in revenue. Recently, brands have been returning to X as Musk’s influence grows in the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>The seven banks that extended $13 billion in loans to Musk to buy X kept the debt on their books for two years until they could sell it all at once last month, according to a source familiar with the transactions.</p>\n<p>This was made possible after a surge in investor interest for exposure to AI companies along with X’s improved operating performance over the previous two quarters, among other factors, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>After the merger, investors who bought the debt from the banks will profit, said Espen Robak, founder of Pluris Valuation Advisors, which specializes in illiquid assets. “For sure the debt is worth more now, if not fully paid off.”</p>\n<p>Separately, a U.S. judge on Friday rejected a bid by Musk to dismiss a lawsuit claiming he had defrauded former Twitter shareholders by waiting too long to disclose his initial investment in the company.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

The likes of Charlie Chaplin and Helen Keller visited in the prewar era, while John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, stayed in the postwar period.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of World War II, the property was confiscated by the Allied forces, who returned it in 1954 when it resumed normal business operations.</p>\n<p>Nikkei interviewed Ando about the classic hotel’s role in Japan’s current inbound tourism boom. Edited excerpts from the interview follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You have returned to the presidency of Fujiya Hotel after serving as president of Hanamaki Onsen in Iwate Prefecture for 10 years. How do you analyze the current tourism situation in Hakone?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> After the Japan Tourism Agency was founded in 2008, attracting inbound tourists became a government imperative. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of visitors to Japan totaled a record high of 36.86 million in 2024. They spent 8.1 trillion yen ($53.79 billion), up a sharp 53% from 5.3 trillion yen in 2023.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F0%2F7%2F3%2F3%2F49223370-6-eng-GB%2FCropped-1742867382photo_SXM2025031600001637.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             The Fujiya Hotel was closed in 2018 for anti-seismic reinforcements and large-scale renovations, resuming&nbsp;operations in July 2020.&nbsp;(Photo by Kohga Takeuchi)                       </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>Hakone is readily accessible from both Narita and Haneda airports. Odawara Station on the Shinkansen bullet train line offers good access, while Odakyu Electric Railway’s Romancecar limited express train is also convenient. Hakone is full of attractions for inbound tourists, including … the Hakone Ropeway and the sightseeing cruise on Lake Ashi (Ashinoko).</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What is the role of your 147-year-old classic hotel?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> A large number of luxury hotels, including foreign hotels, are planning to operate in the Hakone area. There will be many in a higher price range than the Fujiya Hotel. We must offer services that enable guests to feel history and culture and that cannot be copied by new hotels.</p>\n<p>Classic hotels exist in Karuizawa, Nikko, Yokohama and other places, and I believe they serve as local people’s mental anchor. In addition to the attractiveness of our buildings, designated as nationally registered tangible cultural properties, we will walk the royal road in which employees learn the history and culture of Hakone and thoroughly serve guests in a manner that pays great attention to detail.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Japanese have a deep admiration (for the Fujiya Hotel). How do foreign tourists see it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> As China and Europe have long histories, our hotel is not so appealing to people there even if we stress that it was built in the Meiji era (1868-1912). Although French and other Western cuisines are our symbol, visitors from abroad want to eat Japanese meals. While we offer Japanese cuisine at the Kikka-So, a former imperial residence, we have also added Japanese elements to our Western meals.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F6%2F3%2F3%2F3%2F49223336-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-1742867208%E3%83%80%E3%82%A6%E3%83%B3%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89+%2819%29.png?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Akira Ando returned as president of the Fujiya Hotel’s operator in June 2024, after a 10-year hiatus.

Guests from Southeast Asia and Taiwan are so pleased when they see snow. They are surprised at the vibrant colors of tree leaves during the fall foliage season. Our many Instagrammable spots are an attraction.</p>\n<p>Visitors from abroad accounted for 23% of Fujiya Hotel guests in fiscal 2023. We expect a ratio of 28% or so in fiscal 2024. I’ve heard there are hotels with an inbound guest ratio of nearly 80% in Tokyo. As we hope to raise our figure to 50% in the future, we need to carry out programs to increase inbound guests on weekdays and during low tourism seasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are you going to do to contribute to the further development of the Hakone area?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Public and private collaboration is a must for the overseas dissemination of information and public relations activities abroad. Reactions differ if you campaign for tourists abroad as a private group or with government officials. We will also work together with tourism industry officials in Kamakura, Yokohama and other places in a bid to prevent Kanagawa Prefecture from becoming solely a destination of same-day round trips from Tokyo.</p>\n<p>When we showed officials of a South Korean travel agency around, they said, as I was told later, that they wanted to play golf at various courses. There are many golf courses around Hakone, and they can be sources for three- to four-day stays. There also are many mountains good for trekking. Mount Kintoki is known for its association with the legend of the folk hero Kintaro (a boy with superhuman strength who was raised by his “mountain witch” mother). We will propose experimental travel like basking in hot springs.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

He is the first former national leader from Asia to be held at the high-security unit, which also houses five other inmates, including former Kosovo President Hashim Thaci, who faces war crime charges.</p>\n\n<p>Three days before his court appearance, Duterte was <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/11/philippine-police-arrest-ex-president-duterte-on-icc-charges/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">arrested</a> by Philippine police upon arriving at Manila’s airport from Hong Kong and was subsequently <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/12/philippines-duterte-flown-out-of-manila-after-arrest-on-icc-warrant/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">transferred to The Hague</a>. He faces accusations of “crimes against humanity” for allegedly directing police and private death squads to kill at least 43 suspected drug offenders and others between 2011 and 2019, including during his time as mayor of the city of Davao before becoming president of the Philippines in 2016.</p>\n<p>Late last year, a joint committee of the Philippine House of Representatives concluded that more than 30,000 people were killed in a wave of extrajudicial executions during the Duterte administration’s brutal war on drugs. The committee recommended prosecuting the former president within the Philippine judicial system, but ultimately, the case was referred to international authorities — an extraordinary step for a country not involved in armed conflict.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F5%2F5%2F8%2F1%2F49231855-4-eng-GB%2FCropped-1742962985photo_SXM2025032200009878.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Supporters of Duterte gather for a prayer rally in Manila on March 15.      &nbsp; ©             Reuters                               </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>The ICC, a United Nations-backed court of last resort, prosecutes individuals for grave crimes when national courts are unwilling or unable to do so. It is currently presided over by Japanese judge Tomoko Akane. In recent months, the ICC has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the abduction of children from occupied Ukraine, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for attacks on civilians in Gaza. Both face charges of war crimes. However, the enforcement of these warrants relies heavily on the cooperation of the countries involved or those that are signatories to the court’s founding treaty, the Rome Statute.</p>\n<p>In Duterte’s case, the ICC launched a preliminary investigation in 2018 after receiving complaints from victims’ families. However, Duterte removed the Philippines from the court’s jurisdiction the next year, and his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., appeared unwilling to cooperate. This raises the question of what prompted the sudden arrest this time. The ICC asserts that it retains jurisdiction over crimes committed before the country’s withdrawal, while the Marcos administration argues that it could not ignore a formal request for cooperation received through Interpol.</p>\n<p>Behind this seemingly smooth coordination lies a <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Philippines-Marcos-Duterte-conflict-worsens-5-things-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">deeper power struggle</a> between two former allies: the Marcos and Duterte dynasties.</p>\n<p>In the 2022 presidential election, Duterte’s daughter, Sara, who was then mayor of Davao, led early opinion polls. However, in a surprising turn of events, she withdrew from the race and announced her candidacy for vice president, forming a joint ticket with Marcos, who was already running for president. With her support, Marcos surged from second place to win in a landslide.</p>\n<p>Some observers speculated that Sara stepped aside despite her near-certain win to avoid political interference from her father. In fact, Rodrigo Duterte was reportedly outraged by what he saw as Sara’s “defeat by default.” Nevertheless, with the Philippine constitution limiting presidents to a single six-year term with no possibility of re-election, Sara remains eligible for a future run. For Rodrigo Duterte, the alliance may have been a strategic move to avoid potential prosecution after leaving office.</p>\n<p>Marcos, for his part, likely would not have become president without Sara making way. He also owed a political debt to her father: During Duterte’s presidency, he allowed the burial of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., Marcos’ father and former dictator, at the cemetery for national heroes, a move that sparked outrage among human rights groups. The unspoken agreement was that Marcos would not cooperate with the ICC and, after six years, would support Sara’s bid for the presidency.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F2%2F7%2F8%2F1%2F49231872-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-1742963041photo_SXM2025032200009907.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, left, raises the arm of newly elected President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. during his inauguration ceremony in Manila in June 2022.&nbsp;      &nbsp; ©             Reuters                               </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>But not everyone in the Marcos camp was happy with this arrangement. Chief among the dissenters was House Speaker Martin Romualdez, a close ally and maternal cousin of Marcos. A media magnate who controls a broad portfolio of newspapers and broadcast stations, Romualdez “is powerful and has control over the majority of the members of Congress — through patronage politics,” according to Marites Danguilan Vitug, editor at large of the Manila-based online news outlet Rappler.</p>\n<p>Vitug told Nikkei Asia that Romualdez&nbsp;also has “aspirations to run for president in 2028.”</p>\n<p>The lower house scrutinized Sara — who was also serving as education secretary — for alleged misuse of government funds, removing discretionary funds from both the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education in the fiscal 2024 budget. Romualdez is also said to have led a proposal for a constitutional amendment, ostensibly aimed at encouraging greater foreign investment. However, the move drew Rodrigo Duterte’s ire after Marcos hinted at the possibility of revising its provisions, including term limits for public office.</p>\n<p>Rodrigo Duterte accused Marcos of attempting to lift term limits and held a protest rally in his hometown of Davao at the end of January 2024. “You (Marcos) might end up like your father,” Duterte said at the rally, which was also attended by Sara. “That’s what I’m afraid might happen to you.”</p>\n<p>Since then, relations between the two families have quickly deteriorated. In July, Sara resigned as education secretary without explanation and skipped the president’s annual State of the Nation Address. In October, Marcos expressed his disillusionment with Sara, stating that he had considered her a friend but may have been “deceived.” In response, Sara remarked that she had “never been friends with him to begin with.”</p>\n<p>Tensions further escalated when Sara threatened to exhume the remains of Marcos Sr. and dispose of them at sea. “I will get the body of your father and throw it in the West Philippine Sea,” she said.</p>\n<p>In November, Rodrigo Duterte made a significant “slip of the tongue” during a joint congressional committee investigation into the war on drugs, providing grounds for his potential arrest. “I’m asking the ICC to hurry up, and if possible, they can come here and start the investigation tomorrow,” he said at the inquiry.</p>\n<p>Sara made an even more shocking statement, claiming she had contracted an assassin to kill President Marcos, his wife and the house speaker if she were to be killed herself. Her comment sparked a firestorm of controversy. Seizing on the opportunity, the lower house passed an impeachment complaint against her in February with a majority vote. The trial is scheduled to take place in the Senate in June or later, after Congress resumes following the midterm elections in May.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F9%2F8%2F8%2F1%2F49231889-6-eng-GB%2FCropped-1742963114photo_SXM2025032200009939.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Philippine House Speaker Martin Romualdez, right, welcomes then-Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at a joint session of Congress in Quezon, Philippines, in November 2023.      &nbsp; ©             Reuters                               </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>Initially, Marcos hesitated to offer cooperation to the ICC or push for Sara’s impeachment, possibly concerned about breaching their “tacit agreement.” However, as the situation intensified, he seems to have decided to eliminate his political rivals.</p>\n<p>But the Dutertes are not standing idly by.</p>\n<p>As the previous election showed, father and daughter do not always move in lockstep. While both are known for their fiery temperaments, there is a key distinction: Unlike the impulsive and quick-tempered Sara, her father is a seasoned, calculating politician whose primary concern has always been self-preservation. So, why did he take action to provoke the ICC and the Marcos administration?</p>\n<p>The answer may lie in a two-minute video message Duterte recorded in both English and Tagalog for his supporters while being transported to The Hague. He later shared it on social media.</p>\n<p>“Whatever happened in the past, I will be the front of our law enforcement and the military,” Duterte said in the message. “I said this already, that I will protect you, and I will be responsible for everything.”</p>\n<p>“This will be a long legal proceeding, but I say to you, I will continue to serve my country. And so be it, if that is my destiny,” he added.</p>\n<p>Wataru Kusaka, a professor at Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, sees Duterte’s actions as carefully calculated, well attuned to exploiting the cultural dynamics of the&nbsp;sole&nbsp;Asian country in which&nbsp;Christianity is the national religion.</p>\n<p>“Narratives of suffering, death and resurrection resonate strongly with the people of the Philippines,” he said. “In films and dramas, the most popular characters are often martyrs, and Duterte is deliberately playing the role of someone who endures suffering to save the public.”</p>\n<p>Both the Marcos and Duterte camps are thus attempting to leverage international justice for political gain, tapping into a powerful narrative of martyrdom — one that runs deep in the country’s modern political history.</p>\n<p>One of the most prominent examples is that of the late Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., who returned to the Philippines from exile in the U.S. in 1983, fully aware of the danger he would face under the Marcos Sr. dictatorship. He was assassinated upon arrival, but his wife, Corazon Aquino, led the 1986 People Power Revolution that overthrew the Marcos regime and went on to become president. Their eldest son, Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III, later followed in her footsteps to become a national leader.</p>\n<p>Another case in point is Joseph “Erap” Estrada, a popular film star who capitalized on his image as a rugged justice-seeking outlaw. Running on a populist platform with the slogan “Erap for the Poor,” he won the presidency in 1998. Although he was later forced to resign amid corruption charges, Estrada made a political comeback by winning election as mayor of Manila in 2013.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F6%2F0%2F9%2F1%2F49231906-6-eng-GB%2FCropped-1742963176photo_SXM2025032200009972.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Ferdinand Marcos Sr., seated next to his wife Imelda, speaks at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu, Hawaii,&nbsp;in February 1986, after being deposed as president in the People Power Revolution.&nbsp;      &nbsp; ©             AP                               </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>The Marcos family is no stranger to this tradition. In the presidential election three years ago, Marcos Jr. skillfully leveraged social media, spreading misinformation that downplayed the human rights abuses during his father’s regime and claimed strong economic growth that never actually materialized. The campaign successfully reframed his father as a tragic figure driven into exile by his rivals, a narrative that helped the family reclaim the presidency after 36 years.</p>\n<p>Fully aware of the power of the martyrdom narrative, Marcos — now nearing the midpoint of his term — has made a calculated move to marginalize the Duterte faction, which is trying to harness that same power for its own survival.</p>\n<p>All eyes are now on the <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/02/11/philippines-heads-into-midterm-elections-5-things-to-know/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">upcoming midterm elections in May</a>, particularly the Senate race. Of the 24 seats, half are up for grabs, and the newly elected senators will play a crucial role in Sara’s impeachment trial. If two-thirds — at least 16 senators — vote to convict her, she will be removed from office and barred from holding any future public post.</p>\n<p>If that happens, the Duterte camp will lose its strongest contender for the next presidential race. But if Sara survives, a dynastic showdown with Romualdez becomes increasingly likely. As a result, a fierce contest for control of the Senate is all but certain.</p>\n<p>“Duterte’s arrest may influence voter sentiment and political dynamics. However, the arrest highlights the issues of accountability, impunity, and the rule of law, which also sway public opinion, impact the electoral landscape by shifting voter priorities and perceptions, and affect the popularity and even the credibility of candidates associated with Duterte,”&nbsp;Victor Manhit, president of the Philippine think tank Stratbase, said in comments to Nikkei.</p>\n<p>“The most he can do is instigate misguided activism and loyalty among his supporters,” Manhit said.&nbsp;“Our latest analysis projects that the presidential camp is most likely to secure a two-thirds majority of the Senate, which is necessary to convict the vice president.”</p>\n<p>Still, it is important to note that Duterte maintained remarkably high approval ratings until the very end of his term, despite his widely known campaign of extrajudicial killings. This enduring popularity was driven by the public’s yearning for a “strong leader” and an effective approach to law and order.</p>\n<p>How this public sentiment will unfold remains uncertain. Given that the rule of law does not always prevail in the Philippines, the second act of “Duterte theater” could be full of surprises.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

It was a long-awaited update on the project, which was first unveiled in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. has been a difficult market to grow. “For visual works, overseas markets account for only about 30% of total revenue,” said Naohiro Ogata, who oversees the production of Gundam animations. “Compared to how popular the Gundam franchise is in China and other parts of Asia, it is not well-known in Europe and the U.S.”</p>\n<p>Only one Gundam series has aired with all episodes in North America. Airing in 2000, the opportunities to watch that series were limited until streaming platforms became available.</p>\n<p>Bandai Namco intends to handle the North American distribution of the live-action movie on its own so it can also offer more non-live-action movies as well, leveraging its experience of distribution in Japan. With group companies around the world selling toys and games, Ogata said that expanding in-house distribution would allow Bandai Namco to piggyback on the movies to promote those products.</p>\n<p>Gundam is one of Japan’s most famous long-running intellectual properties, with the original “Mobile Suit Gundam” airing in April 1979. It did not have high ratings initially but became a smash hit through reruns and the release of <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/gundam/newsgraphics/bandai-gunpla/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">plastic model kits</a> of the giant robots, known as “Gunpla.”</p>\n<p>The anime’s focus on wartime human drama that goes beyond a good-versus-evil theme has also received plaudits. The franchise has continued to release new anime and movies, boasting more than 70 titles in its library.</p>\n<p>“The series has continued with different protagonists, so each generation in different markets has a special attachment to their ‘first Gundam.’ That’s one of the franchise’s key strengths,” said Hiroshi Sakakibara, president of Bandai Spirits, the core unit for model kits. Sakakibara is also the chief Gundam officer at the parent company.</p>\n<p>The franchise’s growth is driven by anime works and model kits. Sales of Gundam merchandise at Bandai Namco is expected to reach 148 billion yen ($983 million) for the year ending March 31, doubling over the past decade. The series is the second-highest grossing franchise at the parent behind the “Dragon Ball” franchise, which is set to bring in 180 billion yen.</p>\n<p>The Gundam franchise’s longevity is thanks to the substantial freedom afforded by the ownership of intellectual properties. While Bandai Namco has achieved success with products based on such manga comic series as “Dragon Ball” and “One Piece,” they are licensed by major publisher Shueisha, with the original creators and rights holders having a say over a wide range of matters.</p>    <div class=\"ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F6%2F2%2F8%2F8%2F49238826-1-eng-GB%2Fphoto_SXM2025031800013247.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             A giant ‘Gundam’ statue will greet visitors to the Gundam Next Future Pavilion at Osaka Expo, set to open in April.

Coming with complex designs and transformation mechanisms, the models also bring to life the colors shown in anime without the use of paint, thanks to high-quality, multicolor molding technology.</p>\n<p>Overseas markets account for half of total sales. The product lineup ranges from beginner kits sold for around 500 yen to upmarket models priced at 50,000 yen. About 5,000 different models have hit the market to date since the 1980 launch.</p>\n<p>In China, Bandai Namco runs seven shops dedicated to Gundam model kits in cities including Shanghai. The group plans to set up shop in Hubei province’s Wuhan and other inland cities to bring the total to 20 by 2027.</p>\n<p>The group is also planning a new trading card game combining figures and cards for a domestic release in July and an international launch in 2026.</p>\n<p>One challenge in merchandise is that the supply of model kits has been outpaced by global demand. In Japan, the shortage enabled resellers who bought Gundam model kits in bulk to sell at exorbitant prices.</p>\n<p>A new factory is set to come online in Shizuoka prefecture this summer, lifting the group’s production capacity by 35%. But it is unclear whether this will resolve the supply shortage. The group also needs to train enough technicians with required skills.</p>\n<p>“Bandai Namco uses special injection molding machines and it apparently takes time to adjust them when they are installed,” said Hideki Yasuda, senior analyst at Toyo Securities. One concern is that “if the supply of model kits cannot keep up with demand, fans will not be happy and might lose passion for the series,” he said.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

Most tourists tend to visit Gyeongju as a whistlestop day trip from the larger city of Busan, just an hour’s drive away, but I am glad I decided to spend a couple of nights there, giving it the time and attention it deserves.</p>\n\n<p>As in Japan, South Korea’s cherry blossoms begin to bloom in the south, usually in the last week of March (and even a week earlier on Jeju Island), slowly making their way north to Seoul in early April. By the time I fetched up at Gyeongju after a few days of palace-hopping and shopping in Seoul, I half-expected the flowers to have withered. But to my utter delight, I found the city awash with cherry blossoms.</p>\n<p>As well as viewing spots popularized by selfie-seekers I stumbled upon an entire road — Heungmu-ro, I discovered later — lined with trees in full bloom. Such serendipitous discoveries really are the best part of travel. The trees stretched for kilometers along this road, forming a perfect canopy of feathery blooms, under which I walked, stopping for photographs every few feet.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F5%2F6%2F7%2F4%2F49224765-1-eng-GB%2F3.JPG?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Heungmu-ro, with its flowering trees lining the road for kilometers, is one of&nbsp;Gyeongju’s best spots to&nbsp;bask in blossoms.                       </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>I admit that I got quite carried away by the spectacle, dreamily stepping onto the road more than once for that perfect photographic angle. Drivers were extremely considerate, slowing down and waiting patiently until I moved back to the pavement, no longer a danger to their cars or to myself. Perhaps they were just resigned to oblivious tourists in the blossom season.</p>\n<p>This walk was by far my favorite experience — my personal hanami. But even outside the short cherry blossom season, Gyeongju is worth a visit. For this charming town comes with a rich dose of history and culture, and five distinct historic areas inscribed together as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with tombs and monuments, palaces and parks. Gyeongju was the capital of Korea’s Silla dynasty from 57 B.C. to 935 A.D. and the city is now popularly referred to as a “museum without walls.”</p>\n<p>While parts of large South Korean cities like Seoul and Busan have fallen prey to modernization, Gyeongju has clung tenaciously to its rich heritage. By law, buildings in the core historic area must be built in traditional <em>hanok</em> style — with a single story and sloping roofs — which dates to the 14th century. It was quite delightful to walk along the roads and look upon global brands such as Starbucks housed in elegant hanoks cheek by jowl with local cafes.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F7%2F3%2F6%2F4%2F49224637-1-eng-GB%2F5.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Even modern brands like Starbucks are housed in traditional&nbsp;<em>hanok-</em>style buildings in Gyeongju.                       </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>Sated by the cherry blossom chase, I ventured toward more conventional sightseeing, starting with the Tumuli-gongwon, also called the Daereungwon Tomb Complex, in the center of town. Containing 23 ancient tombs of Silla kings, these burial monuments look like grassy mounds that have sprouted up from the earth; the higher the mound, the more influential the person buried underneath.</p>\n<p>Archaeological digs have thrown up fascinating artifacts such as gold and jade jewelry, weapons and pottery. But the finds are on display at the Gyeongju National Museum, with only a few replicas inside the tombs. It was a breezy and beautiful afternoon and having no desire to be cooped up inside a burial mound, I preferred to walk around the expansive grounds, which were carpeted with pink azaleas and purple lupins (not to mention the ubiquitous cherry blossoms).</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F0%2F2%2F6%2F4%2F49224620-1-eng-GB%2F1.JPG?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             With its mix of modern and ancient architecture,&nbsp;Gyeongju is&nbsp;often referred to as a&nbsp;“museum without walls.”                       </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>My aimless amble took me to the Cheomseongdae Observatory, the oldest in Asia, constructed in the mid-first century. It looks like a haphazard pile of stones, but 2,000 years ago observers here were sufficiently sophisticated to plot the night skies and predict weather patterns. The base is formed by 12 stones, one for each month of the year, and the building has 30 vertical layers, symbolizing the days of the month. Exactly 366 stones were used in construction — the number of days in a leap year.</p>\n<p>As the evening wore on, I made several photographic pit stops, eventually fetching up at the grounds of the Donggung Palace, another calm oasis amid the urban chaos. I walked through the grounds to the Wolji Pond, a human-made lake that captures near-perfect reflections of the ornate pavilions all around. As dusk fell and the palace lights came on, a gasp went around the waiting crowd as the reflections magically turned golden. Fittingly, the word <em>wolji</em> means “pond that reflects the moon.”</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F1%2F8%2F0%2F7%2F49227081-1-eng-GB%2F4+full+size.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Evening reflections on Wolji Pond at the Donggung Palace complex.                       </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>Next morning, an hour’s drive outside town took me to a couple of sites which the combined UNESCO World Heritage listing describes as a “religious architectural complex of exceptional significance.” The Seokguram grotto, with its magnificent Buddha statue from the eighth century, is still held sacred by South Korean Buddhists, who often walk there to offer prayers. Even an agnostic foreigner like me could not remain unmoved by the serenity of the setting, high up on Mount Toham and surrounded by lush forest.</p>\n<p>From there, I hiked down a couple of kilometers on a forest path to my next destination — the impressive Buddhist temple of Bulguk-sa. The temple complex contains numerous stone and wood bridges, pagodas, prayer halls and shrines, and was built at the height of the Silla era, reflecting the might and piety of the ancient dynasty.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F3%2F0%2F6%2F4%2F49224603-1-eng-GB%2F9.JPG?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                                                    </span>                               </div>              </div>     <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F2%2F8%2F7%2F4%2F49224782-1-eng-GB%2F2.JPG?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Top: Visitors at&nbsp;the Bulguk-sa&nbsp;Buddhist temple complex, which has multiple pavilions&nbsp;and pagodas.

He had lunch with U.S. troops, received a briefing on Arctic security and addressed the service members.</p>\n<p>Denmark, to which Greenland belongs, has not done its job in keeping the island safe, the vice president argued, repeatedly saying that Copenhagen has “under-invested” in the kind of infrastructure needed to keep the region safe.</p>\n\n<p>“What is the alternative to give up the North Atlantic, to give up the Arctic to China, to Russia and to other regimes that don’t have the best interest of the American people at heart?” he said.</p>\n<p>“We have no other option. We need to take a significant position in Greenland to keep the people here safe.”</p>\n<p>He said his pitch to the people of Greenland is that they would be better off under Washington’s “security umbrella” than they have been under Denmark’s.</p>\n<p>For decades, NATO member Denmark has spent less than 2% of its gross domestic product on defense. Recent measures to bolster defense spending are to increase that figure to 3% of GDP for 2025 and 2026, the government says.</p>\n<p>Before Vance’s visit, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters that “unacceptable pressure” was being placed on Greenland and Denmark. “It is pressure that we will resist,” she said.</p>\n<p>Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede described the trip as “highly aggressive” in an interview with a local newspaper, asking, “What is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us.”</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F4%2F2%2F5%2F5%2F49255524-4-eng-GB%2FCropped-1743198970-10-05T183757Z_1529665416_RC2PL3AOMRZV_RTRMADP_3_GREENLAND-USA-SPACE.JPG?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Pituffik Space Base.

Ms. Vance and the delegation are excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity,” her office had said in a press release.</p>\n<p>The White House changed the nature of the trip, adding the vice president to the delegation and replacing all visits to historical sites with a visit to the base in the northwestern part of the island. At the base, Vance attempted to clarify the intentions of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has only spoken about Greenland in broad&nbsp;strokes.</p>\n<p>At the White House on Friday, Trump said, “We need Greenland.”</p>\n<p>Arguing that the island is important for international security, the president said, “It’s not a question of, ‘Do you think we can do without it?’ We can’t.”</p>\n<p>Vance said Russia and China are taking “an extraordinary interest” in Arctic passageways, Arctic naval routes and in the minerals of the Arctic territories, without offering any evidence of what he called Chinese efforts to “exploit” the island’s resources.</p>\n<p>To counter such actions, Vance said the U.S. will be looking to have a greater military presence in Greenland, giving examples such as additional military icebreakers and naval ships.</p>\n<p>But he downplayed the idea of taking Greenland by force.</p>\n<p>“We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,” he said.</p>\n<p>More likely is for the two sides to cut a “Donald Trump style” deal to ensure the security of the territory, the vice president said.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

The Nasdaq is down around 14% from its record-high close on Dec. 16.</p>\n<p>“The problem is we don’t know the rules and businesses really struggle with that,” said Bob Doll, chief executive officer of Crossmark Investments.</p>\n<p>“Part of the economic weakness we’re experiencing and likely to see more of is a function of individuals and businesses saying, ‘I’m not quite sure what tomorrow’s going to bring, so I’ll just be a little more cautious.'”</p>\n<p>An index tracking interest-rate-sensitive banks fell 2.3%.</p>\n<p>The CBOE volatility index rose almost 3 points to a one-week high.</p>\n<p>CoreWeave’s shares opened nearly 3% below their offer price in the Nvidia-backed artificial intelligence infrastructure company’s Nasdaq debut on Friday. That weak debut could crush hopes of a meaningful recovery in stock market listings, especially as equity markets grapple with tariff-related turmoil.</p>\n<p>Trump’s steadfast commitment to a 25% tariff on auto imports, set to take effect next week, weighed on auto stocks for a second day, with General Motors down 1.1% and Ford losing 1.8%.</p>\n<p>For the week, the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.5%, the Nasdaq declined 2.6%, and the Dow fell about 1%.</p>\n<p>Attention now turns to a fresh round of tariffs the Trump administration is set to unveil on April 2, with Trump recently hinting that these measures might diverge from the straightforward tit-for-tat duties previously pledged.</p>\n<p>Shares of Lululemon Athletica plunged 14% after the sportswear maker lowered its annual forecasts, citing unpredictability surrounding tariffs.</p>\n<p>Mining companies Harmony Gold and Gold Fields rallied 9.5% and 4.5%, respectively, on higher gold prices related to trade war concerns.</p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 is on track for its first quarterly decline in six quarters, while the tech-centric Nasdaq is set for its deepest quarterly drop since 2022.</p>\n<p>UBS Global Wealth Management lowered its year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 to 6,400 from 6,600.</p>\n<p>Wolfspeed slumped 52% a day after the chipmaker appointed a new CEO amid its struggles to improve its financial position.</p>\n<p>Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&amp;P 500 by a 4.5-to-1 ratio.</p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 10 new highs and 23 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 35 new highs and 358 new lows.</p>\n<p>Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 14.3 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 16.2 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

Are things going as planned?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> They’re progressing smoothly. In Japan, sales to government agencies and other organizations are doing well, and the DC [data center] business overseas is booming. This is making up for the poor performance of IT systems in Germany, the U.K., Australia and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The weak yen has caused foreign-currency-denominated debt to swell, making interest payment costs a burden, but we have been moving debt to fixed interest rates and refinancing to yen-denominated debt, helping us stay within our plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Fiscal 2025 is the final year of your medium-term management plan. What is your path to achieving numerical targets like 4.7 trillion yen in consolidated sales and a 10% consolidated operating profit margin?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> We are in the process of examining the situation, but we plan to draw up a plan to achieve the targets. For the figures in the medium-term plan, operating profit for fiscal 2025 would need to grow by double digits from the planned figure for fiscal 2024. Excluding such one-time expenses as mergers and acquisitions and restructuring, we need to add more than 100 billion yen, so it’s a very challenging target.</p>\n<p>Breaking it down, the expansion of the IT system business will account for about 30 billion yen. This can be achieved if it grows at the same rate as the IT market. Synergy effects with NTT Ltd., the IT infrastructure company that was brought under our umbrella in 2022, are expected to be 30 billion yen.</p>\n<p>Through joint proposals with NTT Data’s system development, [IT] orders received in the April-December period of 2024 reached about 160 billion yen, exceeding the amount for all of fiscal 2023 [130 billion yen].</p>\n<p>Integration costs for overseas businesses, such as consolidating and closing offices — which are expected to be 30 billion yen in fiscal 2024 — will be reduced by at least 10 billion yen in fiscal 2025. We plan to set up a DC REIT in fiscal 2025. The rest will be covered by asset sales and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How much will be sold to the data center REIT?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> During the April-December period of 2024, we transferred just under 94 billion yen in DC-related assets to assets held for sale. This is an accounting procedure in preparation for the sale of assets. Though it will depend to some extent on future market conditions, we expect to sell at most around that much in assets in fiscal 2025.</p>\n<p>We will incorporate DCs that have been established for a relatively long time and have high rack occupancy rates into the REIT, with REIT investors that prefer income gains in mind. Because of international accounting standards, profit from the sales will contribute to earnings starting at the operating profit level. Even after the sales, we can expect them to contribute to revenue through maintenance contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Markets forecast net profit of 183.3 billion yen in fiscal 2025. Net profit has been sluggish in recent years. What are the company’s plans?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Since we posted record profit in fiscal 2022 [of 149.9 billion yen], interest-bearing debt from DC investments has increased sharply, and rising interest rates have made interest payments a burden. We expect a financial loss of 81 billion yen for fiscal 2024.</p>\n<p>Net profit trends are directly linked to formation of stock prices. We would like to do something about the stagnation of the past few years by expanding operating profit and reducing financial expenses.</p>\n<p>Although financial earnings for fiscal 2025 may be 20 billion yen deeper in the red than the current fiscal year’s plan, we will likely be able to achieve our highest profit in three years [after factoring in operating profit].</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

But the region hosts another community that is multiplying fast —&nbsp;household pets.</p>\n<p>That means a multibillion-dollar business opportunity is knocking for providers of all kinds of pet products and services, from food and health care to tech and tourism, as people across a region — which the United Nations estimates will be home to 5 billion by 2050 — become more affluent and <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/01/29/india-pet-care-market-booms-as-affluent-owners-pamper-companions/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">splurge on pets</a> as a source of companionship, spurred in part by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>And even in countries like South Korea, where birth rates are alarmingly low, purse strings are being opened for free spending on pets, rather than children, as what experts call the “humanization” of household animals kicks in.</p>\n\n<p>In Gongju, a city just over an hour from Seoul, among those in the market for gourmet treats are 1-year-old golden retriever Lucky, and Dodo, a 6-year-old Doberman. The pair dined out on a recent trip to Dogchelin — a riff on the Michelin guide for restaurants — where they wolfed down a 10,000 won ($7) four-course meal featuring salmon fillet and green beans, as well as pumpkin soup and milk ice cream.</p>\n<p>“They eat a lot. Lucky and Dodo eat 50 kilograms of food each per month,” said their owner Park Sun-young, who along with her husband, Lee Jung-yeon, dotes on the pair who are making their second trip to Dogchelin. “We consider all aspects to choose their food: ingredients, nutrition and of course, price.”</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F9%2F4%2F3%2F8%2F49248349-3-eng-GB%2F20250329-BiA-Market-surge-Bar.png?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                                                    </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>Driven by what it sees as the increasing humanization of household animals, Euromonitor International, a data analytics company, expects the <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/02/08/canned-tuna-giant-thai-union-anchors-growth-hopes-in-pet-food/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">Asia-Pacific market for pet food</a> and other products to hit $34.8 billion by 2029, up by a fifth in the space of five years.

The top three globally were&nbsp;Nestle, Mars and Colgate-Palmolive.</p>\n<p>LG Uplus, a Seoul-based telecoms company, offered charter flight services for pets and their owners four times last year in cooperation with Jeju Air.

China’s pet economy began booming around 2015, shifting in just a decade from feeding pets table scraps to basic pet food, then imported brands, and now premium domestic products. Additionally, young Chinese consumers are more willing to embrace smart pet technology,” said Liu.</p>\n<p>In Hanoi, tech sector worker Le Bui, owner of three cats, told Nikkei Asia that she thinks the rise of the pet industry is underpinned by changing societal priorities as people in countries like Vietnam become better off.</p>\n<p>“More and more people are caring about their mental health. If you are by yourself it’s more fun to have pets,” said Le, 35, who spends around 2.5 million to 3 million Vietnamese dong ($100 to $120) per month on her cats. “It’s nice to have pets waiting on you when you come home from work. It’s also for parents to teach their kids about caring and sharing.”</p>\n<p>“In the past, Vietnamese were so poor we only care about feeding our family. But now we also care about our mental health … so this explains why this industry grows quickly. I think it’s also because of our strong economic growth compared to the region.”</p>\n<p>Pet humanization in places like Vietnam has also shown up in the way consumers feed their animals, moving from feeding pets table scraps to buying food targeted at animal nutrition. In a 2024 Euromonitor survey, 20% of respondents in the Asia-Pacific region said they feed their pets table scraps on an everyday basis, down from 25% in 2021.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F4%2F4%2F9%2F6%2F49226944-3-eng-GB%2F%E1%84%8C%E1%85%A6%E1%84%8C%E1%85%AE%E1%84%92%E1%85%A1%E1%86%BC%E1%84%80%E1%85%A9%E1%86%BC+%E1%84%87%E1%85%A1%E1%86%AB%E1%84%85%E1%85%A7%E1%84%83%E1%85%A9%E1%86%BC%E1%84%86%E1%85%AE%E1%86%AF+%E1%84%80%E1%85%AA%E1%86%AB%E1%84%85%E1%85%A7%E1%86%AB+%E1%84%8B%E1%85%B5%E1%84%86%E1%85%B5%E1%84%8C%E1%85%B5+%281%29.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             LG Uplus, a Seoul-based telecom company, offered sold-out charter flight services from Seoul to Jeju specially tailored for pets and their owners four times last year in cooperation with Jeju Air.

This trend is expected to reverse in the early 2030s. … This demographic shift is likely to negatively impact the performance of the pet care industry.”</p>\n<p>Demographics and decisions not to have children, for financial or other reasons, play a part in many choices to acquire pets across the region.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F5%2F0%2F2%2F5%2F49245205-1-eng-GB%2F20250329+BiA+pet+food+spending+Bar.png?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                                                    </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>In Malaysia, nearly two-thirds of households have pets, according to a study by Global Pets — primarily cats, as dogs are considered “unclean”&nbsp;or impure according to Islam, though some households do still opt for dogs.</p>\n<p>And young married couples in their early 30s, like Nicholas Wong and Su Wen, told Nikkei&nbsp;that it is common among their peers to have pets while some are not keen to have children because of affordability issues.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s more common.

Jawahir said alternative treatments like laser therapy and natural remedies are on the rise because owners are “scared of the side effects of drugs,” opting for alternatives like turmeric or laser treatments, including Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM).</p>\n<p>While TCVM is not yet formally regulated by Malaysian veterinary authorities, its practices, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, and food therapy, are increasingly being integrated into some veterinary clinics.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F0%2F7%2F9%2F3%2F49223970-1-eng-GB%2F%E1%84%83%E1%85%AE%E1%84%85%E1%85%B5%E1%84%83%E1%85%A9%E1%86%BC%E1%84%86%E1%85%AE%E1%86%AF%E1%84%87%E1%85%A7%E1%86%BC%E1%84%8B%E1%85%AF%E1%86%AB_%E1%84%89%E1%85%A1%E1%84%8C%E1%85%B5%E1%86%AB1.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             A vet at an animal hospital&nbsp;in Seoul examines a dog&nbsp;X-ray using technology from telecoms operator SK Telecom.

Pets can improve the mental health of owners and dogs are very sensitive to emotions, and “they know when their owners are stressed.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s very significant compared to my early days. Now, owners want nutrition, specific treatments, and more. They’re willing to spend because they see pets as part of the family,” Jawahir said. She also mentioned that her clients are more educated and saw increased knowledge-seeking behavior on platforms like TikTok and ChatGPT, making it easier to explain to her clients.</p>\n<p>“Malaysia is still catching up, but the industry has a lot of potential. More people are treating pets as family members, and they’re willing to spend on their care. However, vets need to upskill, and the industry needs more manpower to keep up with demand,” she said.</p>\n<p>Services for pets continue beyond their passing.

Bank of America’s net profit increased for the first time in three years last year.</p>\n\n<p>Technology lies at the heart of this push. The bank put $4 billion into technology initiatives last year, double the figure from 10 years earlier.</p>\n<p>If customers use digital technology every day in other parts of their lives, “we have to have the capabilities for them to do that [in banking] or somebody will take that customer away,” Moynihan said.</p>\n<p>Bank of America introduced an artificial-intelligence-powered chatbot, “Erica,” ahead of rivals in 2018, with total interactions with customers reaching 2.5 billion as of the end of last year. Zelle, its electronic money transferring service, has gained 23.7 million users since launching in 2017.</p>\n<p>The goal is to make money for shareholders and increase “teammate delight and satisfaction” at the same time, Moynihan said. Bank of America has 35,000 coders in-house and another 15,000 outside. It was granted the most patents of any U.S. financial institution in 2023.</p>\n<p>The investments are paying off. Linking Erica to the CashPro corporate banking platform has helped increase users for the latter. Over $1 trillion in transfers were approved on CashPro last year.</p>\n<p>Moynihan also expressed an interest in stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like currency or gold. The Trump administration is planning to create a legal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins.</p>\n<p>“We have a bunch of blockchain patents already” and plan to use them once there is a legal framework established, Moynihan said.</p>\n<p>Regarding the rapidly increasing private credit market, he said that “banking regulators… have to be careful because, whether it’s mortgage loans or commercial loans or whatever, the more outside the system, you have to worry whether you can actually see it and understand it and make sure leverage and other” things are being monitored.</p>\n<p>Regarding collaborating with private credit funds, he said, “We work with a lot of the companies now to find assets for them, distribute for them, to finance those assets and we have lots of great clients. So, I’m not sure we’ll ever do anything that exclusive to anybody who we work with a lot.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the governance changes taking place in Japan, he said he hears “from the CEOs I’ve met with, and they’re embracing the reforms and think that they’re going to be good and help them be more competitive and do more things on a global basis.”</p>\n<p>He added that Bank of America’s business can help them “think through their strategies and executing those strategies.”</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

And Indian visitors may help it get there.</p>\n<p>Thailand still welcomes the most tourists of any Southeast Asian nation, with 35.5 million arrivals in 2024. But Vietnam is the region’s fastest-growing market; its 17.5 million arrivals last year representing an impressive 40% year-over-year increase. Vietnam is targeting 23 million tourists in 2025, a 28% climb from 2019’s figure and a 31% rise year over year.</p>\n\n<p>In Vietnam and across Southeast Asia, the makeup of tourists is changing. With China’s overall outbound international travel still around 80% of its 2019 peak and its GDP growth slowing, another source market is rising to fill the gap: India, where outbound international flight capacity has already surged to 110% of the 2019 level.</p>\n<p>For Thailand, this new source of tourists means a reprieve from the economic blow of reduced Chinese travel. For other parts of Southeast Asia, where Chinese travel is surging alongside Indian travel, it represents a double-shot of economic input.</p>\n<p>But in all these places, businesses and the public are going to need to get used to a new mix of tourists — and the new spending patterns that go with it.</p>\n<p>China’s travel rebound is playing out differently across Southeast Asia, but flight capacity between China and the region is still only 77% of what it was in 2019. Thailand was once China’s most popular overseas destination, but that title <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Travel-Leisure/Japan-overtakes-Thailand-as-China-s-most-popular-destination\">belongs to Japan now</a>.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F4%2F9%2F1%2F9%2F49249194-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-17431359012024-12-17T023954Z_259448558_RC2OQBABSLDN_RTRMADP_3_THAILAND-TOURISM.JPG?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             The big Buddha statues are seen at Wat Phra That Pha Sorn Kaew temple, Khao Kho district, Phetchabun province,&nbsp;Thailand, in December&nbsp;2024.      &nbsp; ©             Reuters                               </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>China’s economic expansion has slowed, with real GDP growth coming in at 5% in 2024 compared to pre-pandemic levels of 6% or higher. Its increasingly well-traveled outbound tourists are also looking for new adventures.</p>\n<p>Thailand is targeting 40 million tourists in 2025, up from 35.5 million in 2024. If it can achieve this, it will top 2019’s 39 million arrivals for the first time since the pandemic. But it must do so with less help from Chinese visitors, who in 2019 made up 28% of tourist arrivals but in 2024 accounted for 18.9%. Flight capacity between mainland China and Thailand remains 35% lower than in 2019, suggesting arrivals won’t rise sharply soon.</p>\n<p>To encourage mutual tourism, China entered reciprocal visa-free travel agreements with Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore in 2023 and early 2024. Last year, Malaysia’s arrivals from China reached 105% of 2019’s level while Singapore’s were at 85%, with Chinese people representing the largest and highest-spending segment.</p>\n<p>Thailand’s arrivals from China were just 61% of the 2019 level, albeit with more overall visitors than its neighbors: 6.73 million, compared with 3.29 for Malaysia and 3.08 for Singapore.</p>\n<p>India is rising to challenge China as Southeast Asia’s single-largest source market. New flights and easier visas have ushered in huge increases in Indian arrivals to Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, with India’s strong economic growth (6.4% projected in the 2024-2025 financial year) offering a tailwind.</p>\n<p>Indians are expected to shell out around $120 billion annually on outbound tourism by 2035, according to Capital Economics, which would make them the fourth-biggest spenders globally — behind the U.S., China and Germany.</p>\n<p>Thailand and Malaysia have introduced visa-free arrivals for Indian visitors following the pandemic and have seen arrivals from the subcontinent rise from 2019 by 7% and 54%, respectively. Bangkok has overtaken Dubai as the most popular city destination for Indian travelers.</p>\n<p>The most dramatic increase has been in Vietnam, where new nonstop routes have been introduced since 2022, leading to a 363% increase in Indian arrivals in 2024 from 2019.</p>\n<p>Chinese arrivals in Vietnam, by comparison, were only 65% of their 2019 level. But Vietnam’s meteoric rise continues, driven by India and a growing mix of other international arrivals led by South Korea.</p>\n<p>A slowing economy isn’t the only contributor to Chinese tourists’ changing travel. Mastercard’s data shows they are increasingly interested in new experiences and destinations. We see 9.5% of outbound tourism spend from Chinese travelers on experiences and nightlife. Indians, meanwhile, tend spend more on shopping.</p>\n<p>Many Chinese travelers have already been to Southeast Asia and are keen to go further afield. Evidencing this, 2024 traffic on China-Egypt and China-Central Asia routes was more than double that of 2019.</p>\n<p>Many Indian travelers may be taking their first international trip as members of the country’s growing middle class. Southeast Asia represents an easy first foray. Looser visa requirements are significant: The Indian passport offers visa-free entry to 56 places worldwide, according to the Henley Passport Index. China’s offers 83.</p>\n<p>For first-time travelers, ease, safety and cultural sensitivity are paramount. Many Indians follow specialized diets and the availability of appropriate food ranks high among their travel concerns. Like all tourists, they also want to use payment methods they already understand and feel confident in their physical and financial safety.</p>\n<p>Thailand, which has historically welcomed Indian tourists, has for years offered Indian food at its major tourist destinations. Malaysia, home to a large Indian population, has a built-in ability to welcome these new arrivals. Vietnam is working to ensure its new tourists can eat and shop in the style and at the price point they seek.</p>\n<p>The changing face of tourism in Southeast Asia should help diversify the tourist trade, lending stability to this vital economic pillar. Don’t expect Chinese characters to disappear from menus and hotel lobbies — but look for more Devanagari text alongside them.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

Local media reported that Samsung, Xiaomi’s major rival on smartphones, was exploring cooperation with the Chinese company as it expands its footprint in electric vehicles.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi is building a second EV plant close by. It also plans to launch a sport utility vehicle this year toward the goal of more than doubling overall deliveries from 2024 to 350,000 units.</p>\n\n<p>Around 186,000 SU7s have been sold in China since April 2024, outpacing the Tesla Model 3, according to a Chinese auto data provider. Though the basic SU7 starts at 215,900 yuan ($29,700) to the Model 3’s 235,500 yuan, it has a longer driving range, at 700 kilometers to 634 km, as well as a faster acceleration time from zero to 100 kph, at 5.28 seconds to 6.1 seconds.</p>\n<p>The top-end SU7 also outperforms its Model 3 counterpart, despite being around 10% cheaper.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F3%2F7%2F5%2F4%2F49254573-8-eng-GB%2FCropped-1743172832photo_SXM2025032700014693.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Xiaomi will launch the YU7 electric&nbsp;sport utility vehicle later this year.

Lei said the company’s entry into EVs required people from different backgrounds, and that the only saving grace was that everybody spoke Chinese.</p>\n<p>As a smartphone maker, Xiaomi also has strength in software. The basic SU7 comes with navigate on autopilot (NOA) capabilities for highways, while the two higher-end options come with NOA including for city streets. By comparison, the BMW i3 and Porsche Taycan have no NOA capacity, despite their significantly higher price tag.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi is boosting the capabilities of vehicles it has already sold as well through over-the-air software updates. It launched autopilot functionality for city streets for its two higher-end options at 10 Chinese cities in June 2024, and expanded nationwide in October. Meanwhile, Tesla began testing city autopilot in China in February, but has since suspended the rollout to address safety issues.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi has its eyes on the luxury market as well. On Feb. 27, it launched the <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/02/27/xiaomi-unveils-112250-electric-sedan-in-challenge-to-porsche/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">SU7 Ultra electric sportscar</a>, which can go from zero to 100 kph in two seconds — faster than the Porsche Taycan Turbo S at a third of the price tag. Orders hit Xiaomi’s annual goal of 10,000 units in just two hours.</p>\n<p>But where Xiaomi truly stands out is its ability to grow its existing businesses, including smartphones and electronics, while expanding into EVs. The company logged record groupwide revenues and net profit in 2024, and increased its liquid assets by 28% to 175.1 billion yuan.</p>\n<p>This marked Xiaomi’s strongest-ever financial results, Lei posted on social media after full-year earnings were announced on March 18.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F0%2F9%2F5%2F4%2F49254590-7-eng-GB%2FCropped-1743173033N+Xiaomi+Beijing.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Xiaomi branched into EVs after it was blacklisted by the U.S. in 2021, casting a shadow over its smartphone operations.&nbsp;(Photo by Tomoki Mera)                       </span>                               </div>              </div> <p>Other automakers have not been as successful. Volkswagen’s net profit dropped 33% last year to 10.72 billion euros ($11.6 billion) amid rising costs and falling Chinese sales. Nissan Motor is seen logging an 80 billion yen ($533 million) net loss for the year ending Monday.</p>\n<p>It is unclear when Xiaomi’s EV business will become profitable, given factors like investments into its second plant, according to President Lu Weibing. But the goal does not appear too far off. While Xiaomi’s EV and related operations suffered a 6.2 billion net loss for all of 2024, quarterly losses have continued to shrink.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi’s success is unusual even among Chinese EV makers. Xiaopeng sold 190,000 vehicles and reported a 5.5 billion yuan net loss in 2024, 10 years after its founding.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Xiaomi aims to build a smart “Human x Car x Home” ecosystem. The company’s EVs are equipped with the same HyperOS as its smartphones, allowing drivers to access music subscriptions or operate home appliances from their cars’ control panels, for example.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi plans to generate further synergies between its smartphones, appliances and EVs. The company aims to expand its network of smartphone and appliance retailers by 30% by the end of the year to up to 20,000 locations, including up to 400 that also sell EVs.</p>\n<p>Lei first decided to expand Xiaomi into EVs after the U.S. sanctioned the company in January 2021, raising concerns that chip supply restrictions could impact its smartphone business. The company announced that March that it would invest $10 billion into EVs over 10 years. It plans to eventually <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/21/chinese-carmakers-accelerate-global-push-amid-geopolitical-risks-tariffs/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">expand overseas</a> as well.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Xiaomi said it will raise over $5 billion through a top-up placement that amounts to 3% of its outstanding shares. Its stock price has since fallen around 10% on concerns of a stock dilution. But it remains up roughly 50% from the beginning of the year, reflecting high hopes for the company among investors.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

I call on any countries, any organization and the public in Myanmar to support us.”</p> <p>Marie Manrique, Program Coordinator for the International Federation of the Red Cross, said to reporters in Geneva, via video link from Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city: “Public infrastructure has been damaged, including roads, bridges and public buildings.

He announced this past Wednesday a <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/27/trump-announces-additional-25-tariff-on-foreign-made-autos/content.html\">25% tariff</a> on foreign-made vehicles, starting April 3.</p>\n\n<p>Honda Motor’s exports increased 4% to 43,000 units for the three-month period. The company builds the relatively low-priced HR-V sport utility vehicle in Mexico, of which it exported 170,000 to the U.S. throughout 2024, accounting for more than 10% of its U.S. auto sales volume.</p>\n<p>The economic impact of the new auto tariffs on Honda, including those targeting Canada, is expected to amount to 700 billion yen ($4.7 billion). The company has been moving to soften the blow.</p>\n<p>Shinji Aoyama, a Honda executive vice president who serves as risk management officer, said in February that the company would try to send Mexican- and Canadian-built vehicles to the U.S. earlier — possibly that month — ahead of the tariffs.</p>\n<p>Toyota Motor, which builds the Tacoma pickup truck in Mexico, saw the largest increase in exports from the country to the U.S. among Japanese automakers. They came to 64,000 units for the three months ended February — 3.7 times the year-earlier level.</p>\n<p>The jump owes mainly to a lower baseline in late 2023 and early 2024, when Toyota halted Mexican production to switch to new models.</p>\n<p>“There is strong demand for cars in the U.S.,” said Seiji Sugiura, senior analyst at the Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory. “Given the Trump tariffs, [automakers] were likely conscious of a need to build up inventory.”</p>\n<p>The Trump administration plans to adjust the duty on tariff-free vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The changes would be based on the percentage of U.S.-made parts used in the vehicles.</p>\n<p>This would put pressure on Japanese automakers to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Trump-tariffs-shake-Asian-carmakers-Mexico-production-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">reorganize</a> their North American production networks.</p>\n<p>The auto tariffs announced this week will ultimately lead to “higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S.,” said Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, in a statement. The group consists of a dozen non-U.S. automakers with American operations.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

The group is considering procuring graphics processing units from Nvidia and may introduce technology from German robotics company Agile Robots, sources said. SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund has invested in Agile Robots.</p>\n<p>Among potential partner manufacturers is Taiwanese company Foxconn, sources said. SoftBank Group aims to reduce human involvement by employing AI in production processes for a wide range of products, such as smartphones, cars, servers and air conditioners.</p>\n<p>Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, has partnered with SoftBank Group before. The Taiwanese company served as the manufacturer for the Pepper robot, and it is expected to be the sole supplier of servers for the Stargate AI infrastructure project with ChatGPT developer OpenAI.</p>\n<p>For the industrial parks, SoftBank Group intends to use a form of project financing backed by equipment usage fees, similar to the AI data centers proposed for the Stargate project.</p>\n<p>It is also likely to tap financing from banks and investment funds. Middle Eastern money is a promising source, possibly including Abu Dhabi-based tech investor MGX and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The Saudi Arabian government and SoftBank Group are already working on a joint robotics venture.</p>\n<p>But the Stargate project is still a work in progress. SoftBank Group’s plan is to invest 10% to 20% of the capital with three other companies and finance the rest. It is unclear whether the framework can be set before locations are selected and construction of the facilities begins.</p>\n<p>The industrial park plan would have an even larger scale, leaving questions about whether SoftBank Group would be able to secure partner manufacturers and funding.</p>\n<p>Son has repeatedly changed SoftBank Group’s focus in line with technological advances, from internet sites to mobile phones to tech investment. It now aims to become the world’s largest AI group and is planning to invest tens of billions of dollars in OpenAI.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

It’s down in the 60s,” he said, meaning that there is “plenty of room to ramp up quickly the kind of production we need.”</p>\n\n<p>By increasing the utilization rate, by 25 or 30 points, “that won’t create any inflation. It’ll just create prosperity,” he emphasized.</p>\n<p>If, for instance, American factories were running at 95% utilization, the situation would have been “totally different,” he said.</p>\n<p>Navarro told the show that moving production to the U.S. is not necessarily limited to greenfield investment, such as opening new factories. There will also be “brownfield” investment, he said, referring to purchasing or leasing existing facilities.</p>\n<p>“Throughout the Midwest, there’s shuttered factories that can be easily reopened,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Navarro added that there are national security aspects in Trump’s auto tariffs. He said the auto industry was part of the “Arsenal of Democracy” that won World War II. American auto companies made jeeps, tanks and trucks and the Allies would not have been able to prevail without the “might” of the American industry, he said.</p>\n<p>He lamented the current state of the U.S. auto sector as nothing but an assembly shop for parts that come from the rest of the world. The majority of the most valuable components of a car — such as the engine, transmission and drivetrain — come from countries like Germany and Japan, he said.</p>\n<p>“So, what President Trump wants to do is bring that back,” he added.</p>\n<p>But shares of America’s Big Three automakers — General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, formerly Chrysler — have dropped over 13%, 6% and 8%, respectively, in the past two days, reflecting the market’s lack of confidence in the Trump administration’s economic policy.</p>\n<p>Yet, Navarro’s explanation is in line with the rejection of globalization that Vice President JD Vance laid out in a speech this month.</p>\n<p>Vance told the American Dynamism conference in Washington that past U.S. trade policy had “two conceits” about globalization — the belief that design and manufacturing could be separated, and that cheap labor was beneficial.</p>\n<p>Vance called cheap labor “a drug” that companies have become addicted to and that shipping manufacturing overseas was an easy alternative to investing in innovation.</p>\n<p>Trump is “dead serious” about bringing jobs back to the U.S., the vice president said.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

R. Berkley in a bid to tap into the growing specialty insurance market.</p>\n<p>The Japanese property insurer aims to finish the share purchase by the end of March 2026. It will appoint one director to W. R. Berkley’s board.</p>\n<p>W. R. Berkley is a Fortune 500 company strong in liability insurance for corporate executives, among other specialty lines. Mitsui Sumitomo looks to gain know-how in specialty insurance and improve product development and risk assessment.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., the market for general insurance products is expected to grow 8% to 9% a year, but specialty insurance is seen rising more than 10%. Specialty insurance, which also covers events like cyberattacks, tends to produce stable earnings, since it is less exposed to natural disasters.</p>\n<p>W. R. Berkley, founded in 1967 and headquartered in the U.S. state of Connecticut, saw net premiums written climb 9% last year to over $11.9 billion. Consolidated net profit rose 27% to $1.7 billion. It counts global asset management leader BlackRock as a shareholder.</p>\n<p>MS&amp;AD Insurance Group Holdings, the parent company of Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, reported a group adjusted profit of 379.9 billion yen ($2.53 billion) for the fiscal year ended March 2024. Overseas business accounted for 139.5 billion yen, or about 37%, of that figure.</p>\n<p>Other Japanese nonlife insurance companies have also made acquisitions in the specialty field. Tokio Marine Holdings purchased U.S.-based HCC Insurance Holdings for $7.5 billion in 2015. Sompo Holdings acquired U.S. player Endurance Specialty Holdings, now Sompo International, for $6.3 billion about two years later.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

The U.S. provided about $300 million in humanitarian aid for the Rohingya in 2024.</p>\n<p>Refugees in Cox’s Bazar welcomed the announcement that aid will continue.</p>\n<p>“I am glad that the President of America is donating the money, which will help (provide food) our grandchildren. We are very happy,” said 60-year-old Hussain Bahar.</p>\n<p>Forid Alam, a 36-year-old refugee at Balukhali Rohingya refugee camp, said the announcement was a gift coming days before Muslims’ largest festival Eid al-Fitr.</p>\n<p>“We are grateful to the people of Bangladesh, its government, and the donors who are donating. We are so thrilled after hearing the news ahead of Eid that we don’t have words to express our gratitude. We are praying from the bottom of our hearts and are truly glad,” he said.</p>\n<p>U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who visited Bangladesh recently, said Cox’s Bazar is “ground zero for the impact of the budget cuts on people in desperate need.”</p>\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya reside in Bangladesh, including more than 700,000 who arrived in 2017 fleeing persecution in Myanmar. About 70,000 others crossed the border from Myanmar in 2024 when, during fighting with the military junta, the opposition force known as the Arakan Army effectively took over Rakhine state where Rohingya were displaced.</p>\n<p>Bangladesh says repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar is the ultimate solution, but complexities over verification and other diplomatic and political issues have made the refugees’ return uncertain.</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

At the same time, tariffs are eating into profit margins and are forcing companies to consider mitigation strategies from supply chain tweaks to price increases.</p>\n<p>These choices will be further complicated next week as new reciprocal tariffs are expected to be announced on April 2. And partially implemented tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico remain in flux.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s still a great deal of uncertainty as to what complete hits, how those change. April 2 is a big day in terms of reciprocal tariffs, and so our teams are actively looking to mitigate” said Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon Jr. on the company earnings call Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Apparel company Lululemon beat revenue expectations when it announced earnings Thursday, but it projects a 100 basis point decline in operating margin on the year, mostly attributable to tariffs on China and Mexico.</p>\n<p>Trump has levied a number of tariffs since returning to the White House in January, including a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods in early February that increased to 20% on March 4, the same day 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods went into effect — though a significant portion of goods have been exempt so far.</p>\n<p>On top of the unannounced reciprocal tariffs, an additional <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/27/trump-announces-additional-25-tariff-on-foreign-made-autos/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">25% tariff on automobiles</a> is set to take effect April 2.</p>\n<p>Many companies have not included Trump’s second round of tariffs into their guidance due to a lack of clarity on timing and scope.</p>\n<p>Dollar Tree — a major chain of discount variety stores — said they had been able to mitigate roughly 90% of the expected hit by the initial 10% levy on Chinese goods, which would have cost them roughly $15 million to $20 million each month.</p>\n<p>“We put actions in place as soon as November,” Creedon said, including tweaking manufacturing, negotiating with suppliers, and increasing prices when necessary.</p>\n<p>The company will use a similar approach for the increased tariff on China and those on Canada and Mexico, but it could not say how effective it will be in curbing the $20 million per month the new tariffs are projected to cost them.</p>\n<p>Trump’s first term and the COVID-19 pandemic led many companies, including Dollar Tree, toward a so-called China plus one strategy that seeks to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on the country.</p>\n<p>But other companies with more direct manufacturing in China may not be able to be as nimble. For shoe and apparel giant Nike, 22% of its factories and 30% of its materials facilities are in China.</p>\n<p>Last week, the company reported a much-worse-than-expected decline in sales and projected a drop in gross margins in the quarter ahead, in large part due to tariffs on imports from China and Mexico.</p>\n<p>In addition to cutting into margins for the businesses themselves, tariffs are adding onto the already souring recession fears and inflationary concerns that are causing consumers to cut back on spending.</p>\n<p>“As we enter 2025, we are not anticipating improvement in the microenvironmental, particularly for our core customer,” said CEO Todd Vasos of Dollar General, the leading U.S. low-cost variety store, on the company’s earnings call this month.</p>\n<p>“We believe that it’s going to get even more fluid with some of the tariffs,” he said. “So we’re watching that very closely as we move through the upcoming weeks.”</p>\n\n </div>\n        ",

But since it struck the deal in early March — in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s vows to wrest control of the Panama Canal away from China — the company has come under relentless criticism from Chinese state media, prompting speculation about the fate of the agreement.</p>\n<p>The attacks, which portray the transaction as unpatriotic and contrary to China’s interests, continued Friday. The latest edition of Ta Kung Pao — a Hong Kong-based newspaper controlled by Beijing that has spearheaded the campaign against the sale — included a story headlined, “Only by crossing the river together with the state, businesspeople gain respect.” The article cited various pro-Beijing figures as well as ordinary “citizens” who expressed views that safeguarding security and state interests should be the priority.</p>\n\n<p>Several of Ta Kung Pao’s articles on the matter have been reposted in full by the joint official website of the Chinese Communist Party’s Hong Kong and Macao Work Office and the central government’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office — implying that the government endorses them. On Wednesday and Thursday, the website reposted articles stressing that businesses will destroy their own foundation if they ignore national interests and must stand with the state against hegemony and bullying.</p>\n<p>The intense pressure has cast a shadow over CK Hutchison, all entities in Li Ka-shing’s empire, and the broader Chinese business community. Chinese authorities have instructed state-owned enterprises to halt new deals linked to the Hong Kong-based group, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.</p>\n<p>When questioned about this directive on Thursday evening, Xu Yugao, joint company secretary and in-house counsel at CNOOC — a Hong Kong-listed arm of one of China’s three state-owned oil majors — told reporters and analysts that he and many others were “following” the developments surrounding the deal with great interest.</p>\n<p>At the same time, he said that business dealings remained “extremely steady” with no “external interfering factors.” Xu was referring to a joint oil exploration project in the South China Sea with the former Husky Energy, once a CK Hutchison company that recently merged with Canadian energy conglomerate Cenovus. While Xu said he was unsure whether its Canadian partner is linked with Li Ka-shing, CK Hutchison’s disclosure indicates that it is an investor in Cenovus.</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F1%2F9%2F4%2F0%2F49250491-4-eng-GB%2FCropped-1743150009250328+Ta+Kung+Pao.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             Ta Kung Pao,&nbsp;a Hong Kong-based daily newspaper controlled by Beijing, has been spearheading the criticism&nbsp;against CK Hutchison’s ports sale.

But if it does go forward, Li Ka-shing and his family business empire “could be seen to have defied Beijing and got away with it. This would be an awkward loss of face for Xi Jinping,” raising questions about future consequences for the family and group.</p>\n<p>Gave believes that China is “reminding Hong Kong businesses that Beijing should have a say in important strategic decisions,” and that it still hopes to sink the deal not only by squeezing CK Hutchison “but perhaps by putting pressure on BlackRock,” which has business interests in China as well.</p>\n<p>CK Hutchison and BlackRock did not immediately respond to Nikkei Asia’s requests for comments.</p>\n<p>Bryan Mercurio, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong specializing in international economic law and bilateral trade agreements, told Nikkei Asia that CK Hutchison could conceivably pull out and compensate BlackRock using a break clause. He argued that CK Hutchison “would have to react accordingly if China pulled internal economic levers,” considering its significant business exposure in China, despite its <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/21/ck-hutchison-tilts-more-to-europe-than-china-results-show-amid-panama-row/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener\">diversification</a> over the years.</p>\n<p>Yet, Mercurio cautioned that blocking the deal would “serve to confirm Trump’s rhetoric that ‘China’ controlled the port.”</p>\n<p>Likewise, he stressed that if Hong Kong authorities were to step in to block the transaction, “it would be an unprecedented move that could reinforce the claims of President Trump and others asserting that Hong Kong’s trade, finance and policies are not entirely independent from China.”</p>\n<p>He said that the saga has fewer implications for foreign companies or specific sectors such as finance, but that “other Hong Kong conglomerates would be wise to take notice.”</p>    <div class=\"align-center ez-embed-type-image\">                                                                                           <div class=\"article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline\" style=\"max-width: 770px\" data-trackable=\"image-inline\">                                                 <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F8%2F0%2F5%2F0%2F49250508-6-eng-GB%2FCropped-1743150160+CNOOC+presser.jpg?source=nar-cms\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\">                           <span class=\"article__caption\" style=\"max-width: 770px\">                             CNOOC Chairman Wang Dongjin, third from left, designated the state oil company’s in-house legal counsel Xu Yugao, far left, to answer questions regarding CK Hutchison and geopolitical matters during its annual earnings briefing in Hong Kong on March 27.
