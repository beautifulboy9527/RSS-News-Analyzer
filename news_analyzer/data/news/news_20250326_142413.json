    "description": "In today’s newsletter: With elbows up on both sides, two very different political operators – Mark Carney and the Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre – attempt to fend off threats from the south Good morning. When Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning as Canada’s prime minister in January, he did so amid surging support for the Conservative opposition and a sense that its Trump-adjacent leader, Pierre Poilievre, might be the right candidate for a new political era. The Liberals’ near-decade in power appeared to be close to an end. Now, Trudeau’s successor, the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, has called a snap general election against a dramatically different political backdrop. With Donald Trump’s tariff war and musings about Canada’s future as a 51st state the inescapable mood music, many voters who had given up on the Liberals appear ready to give them another hearing – and Poilievre is trying to distance himself from the president whose methods he was once so happy to adopt. Trump administration | A catastrophic security leak triggered outrage in US politics after senior Trump administration officials accidentally broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along. The stunning breach implicates key figures in the Trump administration including the vice-president, JD Vance. Domestic violence | Domestic abusers are driving their victims to suicide , police have warned, as they admitted to past mistakes and pledged to investigate more “hidden” cases of violence against women. The concession came as deaths by suicide among victims of domestic abuse surpassed the number of people killed by an intimate partner for a second year in a row. UK economy | Rachel Reeves will put £2bn into affordable housing in a bid to “sweeten the pill” of the spending cuts being announced at this week’s spring statement. The chancellor will set out one of the tightest budget buffers on record, with the Office for Budget Responsibility expected to put the government about £5bn in the red. Turkey | Turkish authorities have arrested more than 1,100 people including journalists , while bombarding the social media platform X with requests to block hundreds of accounts after tens of thousands took to the streets in the largest anti-government demonstrations in years. Archaeology | One of the biggest and most important iron age hoards ever found in the UK has been revealed, potentially altering our understanding of life in Britain 2,000 years ago. More than 800 objects were unearthed in a field near the village of Melsonby, North Yorkshire dating back to the first century. Continue reading...",

Some patients are facing increasingly long waits for care, of up to two years, especially for NHS fertility treatment. 51% of patients who used donor sperm got it from abroad, where rules on the maximum number of families that can be created by one donor are looser than in the UK. While 73% of patients are satisfied with their fertility treatment, Asian and black patients are less likely to be satisfied. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The Amazon Spring Sale has arrived, bringing a slew of discounts on household essentials, fashion, outdoor gear and even furniture. We at Engadget are focused on tech, and while the selection this time around isn’t quite as good as that of Amazon Prime Day in July, there are some decent discounts to be had. Some of our favorite robot vacuums, air purifiers, headphones and storage gear are on sale right now for some of the best prices we’ve seen this year so far. Below, you’ll find all of the best tech deals we could find in the Amazon Spring Sale. The shopping event runs through March 31, so be sure to check back for the latest deals as they become available. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals 10th-gen iPad for $269 (23 percent off): The previous version of most affordable iPad gives you an A14 Bionic chip, a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, TouchID built into the lock button and more. It’s compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the keyboard folio, plus we found it to have solid performance and a matching battery life. Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. A quick-charge feature will net you 2.5 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging, so you&#39;ll rarely have to go without them, too. Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones for $349 ($80 off): These hold the top spot in our best wireless headphones guide for excellent noise cancellation. These cans will give you a step up in ANC, blocking out most noise and chatter of those around you. General audio quality has been improved as well, and they have a comfy fit. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $318 (20 percent off): These top our list of the best wireless headphones you can get right now thanks to their supreme comfort, excellent sound quality and ANC, multipoint connectivity and 30-hour battery life. Dyson AM09 heater and fan for $300 (36 percent off): The AM09 has been around for ages, and for good reason. It&#39;s an excellent heater during cold months and fan during warm months, so you can use it all year round. Jet Focus control lets you choose from Focused or Diffused for personal or whole-room heating or cooling, and the handy sleep timer lets you set when the device turns off in intervals from 15 minutes up to nine hours. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off): This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off): A version of one of our favorite air fryers , this air fryer toaster oven has 11 cooking modes including air fry, broil, bake, roast and more, and it has a large capacity that can fit up to six slices of bread at once or a 13-inch pizza. The Pro model is also on sale, down to $320 from $400. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $20 (43 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget streaming device can play content at 1080p/60fps and now its remote can also control your TV&#39;s power and volume. There&#39;s also Alexa support built into the remote, so you can use voice commands to search for content. Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $169 ($80 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you&#39;re on the market for a new desktop, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Blink Mini 2 for $20 (50 percent off): Blink&#39;s latest wired, indoor security camera is one of our favorites , particularly if you&#39;re just starting out building a security camera system. It&#39;s easy to set up and use, and it works seamlessly with Amazon&#39;s Alexa. Plus, if you want a local storage option, you can buy the Blink Sync Module 2 and a thumb drive to store video clips locally. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 ($30 off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. Levoit Core 400S air purifier for $187 ($33 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier for most people, the Core 400S has easy-to-use onboard controls, powerful filtering technology that isn&#39;t too loud and relatively affordable replacement filters. It reliably improved air quality in our testing, and even though its mobile app is a little overstuffed, it gives you another way to control and monitor the device. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "description": "Gaming journalism stalwart Game Informer has risen from the ashes. More than thirty years after its debut issue back in August 1991, the media outlet was officially shut down by parent company GameStop in August 2024. Since then, the rights to Game Informer were acquired by Gunzilla Games and, in an all-to-rare win for today&#39;s media world, the entire team that worked for Game Informer at the time of its closure will return to their jobs. Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller posted the details about how the outlet was saved from the brink and noted that Gunzilla Games will be a hands-off boss. &quot;The new owners insisted on the idea of Game Informer remaining an independent editorial outlet,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They felt just as strongly as our team did that the only path forward was with an editorial group that made 100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so, without any influence from them or anyone else.&quot; “We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry,&quot; Gunzilla CEO and Co-Founder Vlad Korolov said . The website and its back catalog of content have been republished online. Game Informer &#39;s staff have also published reviews of more than two dozen games that came out during the site&#39;s hiatus and belatedly compiled their requisite best games of 2024 list. The print magazine is also expected to resume activity, and Miller said more details will be forthcoming about subscription and membership options. Gunzilla Games, which counts Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp among its leadership, made a battle royale shooter called Off the Grid and also developed the GUNZ blockchain platform.

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale tech deals under $50: The best sales on our favorite budget gear",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-tech-deals-under-50-the-best-sales-on-our-favorite-budget-gear-091512204.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon kicked off its latest Big Spring Sale today, and though the week-long event mostly focuses on things like apparel and outdoor goods, it still includes a few notable discounts on electronics. We have a big roundup with the best of those , but if you’re on a tighter budget, below we’ve dug up a few decent tech deals that are available for less than $50. Generally speaking, this sale doesn&#39;t emphasize tech nearly as much as Black Friday or Prime Day, but the offers below bring several accessories we recommend near their all-time lows. As a reminder, the event runs through March 31, and you don’t need to be an Amazon Prime member to see most of the price drops. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals under $50 Anker PowerConf C200 for $48 ($12 off MSRP) : The PowerConf C200 is our favorite webcam for those on a tighter budget due to its crisp video quality, easy setup, solid microphones and built-in privacy cover. Its USB cable is on the shorter side, and it can’t match the overall accuracy of our top pick, but it’s still a clear upgrade over a built-in laptop camera for a much lower price. This is another deal we’ve seen numerous times in the last year, but it’s as low as the camera usually goes. Anker 525 Charging Station for $30 ($36 off) : We recommend this reliable desktop charging station in our remote worker gift guide . It can’t provide the absolute fastest charge to your smartphone or laptop (topping out at a quick enough 67W), but it packs four USB ports — two USB-C, two USB-A — and three AC outlets in a frame that’s small enough to fit on a crowded desk. This deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen. The Anker 525 Charging Station. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anker Nano Charger 30W for $13 ($10 off) : It’s hard to have too many portable wall chargers on standby. This one from Anker should be particularly useful for traveling: At just over an inch thick, it’s small enough to fit in a pocket, while its 30W USB-C port is enough to top up recent iPhones at full speed. (That’s not enough for some newer Android phones , though.) This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Amazon Music Unlimited 3-month trial for free ($24 off) : Amazon is offering new subscribers three months of its Music Unlimited streaming service for free. Normally, it gives new users a one-month trial. Though Music Unlimited isn’t a top pick in our guide to the best music services , it still gets you lossless streaming quality and an extensive library of both music and podcasts. You could do worse if you just want to bum a few months of music streaming for no cost. Just note that your subscription will auto-renew once the trial period ends until you cancel. The Blink Mini 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Blink Mini 2 for $20 ($20 off) : This deal ties the lowest price to date for the Blink Mini 2, which is the budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras . This one comes with its share of trade-offs for the low price — its image quality isn’t the best, it locks certain features behind a paywall and it won’t automatically arm when you leave the house — but it still provides functional 1080p video, color night vision, motion alerts and Alexa support in a weather-resistant frame. It’s fairly simple to set up, too, though you’ll need to buy an external module if you want to store clips locally. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Unlike the AirTag, it can also attach directly to a keychain. It probably isn’t the safest choice for long-distance travel, but it’s a convenient security blanket if you, say, leave your keys or wallet behind at a restaurant. This is another discount that’s been available for a few weeks, but it’s just 10 cents more the best price we’ve seen.

    "title": "The Pentagon warns government officials that Signal is being targeted by Russian hackers",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/the-pentagon-warns-government-officials-that-signal-is-being-targeted-by-russian-hackers-203436757.html?src=rss",
    "description": "As it turns out, including a reporter in your national security leader group chat about military strikes isn&#39;t the only way to compromise sensitive information on Signal. NPR reported on Tuesday that, days after the Trump administration&#39;s preposterous and dangerous national security fumble , the Pentagon issued a warning against using the messaging app due to a phishing vulnerability. &quot;A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger application,&quot; a department-wide email obtained by NPR reads. &quot;Russian professional hacking groups are employing [Signal&#39;s] &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations.&quot; The publication says the memo states that Russian hacking groups are &quot;targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.&quot; A Signal spokesperson told NPR that the memo wasn&#39;t about Signal&#39;s security but about phishing attacks on the platform. So, if you&#39;re using the app, be especially mindful of attempts to trick you into linking devices to your account. Or simply communicate through different channels. The Pentagon directive follows a scandal that, at least in previous eras, would have ended the careers of a long list of high-profile officials. (In this one… who knows?) The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that a group of Trump administration national security officials inadvertently included him in a Signal group chat discussing military strikes in Yemen. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images The conversation included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, among others. They — with Goldberg essentially CC&#39;d — discussed the timing, targets and weapons involved in bombing Houthi sites in Yemen. A 2023 Department of Defense memo prohibited using mobile apps for even &quot;controlled unclassified information.&quot; NPR notes that military planning is many degrees more sensitive than that. And that doesn&#39;t even cover accidentally including a journalist in the conversation. The entire Atlantic article is worth a read, but a few gems from the chat include Hegseth&#39;s writing, &quot;I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It&#39;s PATHETIC.&quot; And, &quot;Nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.&quot; Adding to the &quot;It would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so dangerous&quot; nature of the fiasco, Hegseth went on camera to deny the chat&#39;s authenticity after the White House confirmed it. Although the fallout is still taking shape, here&#39;s an early taste. Watch below as retired US Navy captain and current US Senator Mark Kelly grills Gabbard and Ratcliffe on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals: Save up to $200 on AirPods, iPads and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-apple-deals-save-up-to-200-on-airpods-ipads-and-more-092050968.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon has rolled out another sitewide sales event . The Big Spring Sale, as this one is called, is focused on apparel and outdoor goods more than electronics, but we’ve cut through the noise and found a few tech deals anyway. If you’re looking for a new Apple device specifically, good news: A handful of AirPods, iPads and Apple Watches are at or near their lowest prices to date. Many of those discounts aren’t explicitly tied to the sale, but if you just want to save a little cash, that shouldn’t matter much. We’ve rounded up the best Spring Sale Apple deals we could find below. As a refresher, Amazon says the event will run through March 31, and none of the deals below are exclusive to Prime members. Best Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $150 ($29 off MSRP) : This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple’s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn’t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a score of 86 in our review. This discount is $11 higher than the best price we’ve seen, but it’s about as low as the earbuds have fallen outside of that. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. The Apple Watch Series 10. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off) : The top pick in our guide to the best smartwatches , the Series 10 is a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer profile and a marginally larger display compared to the previous Series 9. That said, it remains a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. It should be a welcome upgrade if you’re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch (think pre-Series 7) — just keep in mind a patent dispute has locked it out the blood oxygen detection features found on those older models. This $100 discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the non-cellular model with a 42mm case. Apple iPad (A16) for $329 ($20 off) : The newest entry-level iPad only arrived three weeks ago, but Amazon is currently selling it for $20 less than Apple direct, which is a decent little savings if you planned on grabbing the tablet early anyway. This one is another small update, but it now comes with a faster A16 chip, more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. Our review is coming soon, but TL;DR: If you only need an iPad for media consumption and lighter work, it’s still a fine value. Apple iPad Air 11-inch (M3) for $549 ($50 off) : Much like the deal on the base iPad above, this isn’t a huge discount, but it’s a nice chance to save a few bucks compared to buying from Apple directly. The new iPad Air was released on the same day as the iPad (A16) and is a similarly minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still prefer the Air over the base model if you can swing it: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. The older M2-powered model is an even better value if you can find it on sale, but either way the Air is the iPad we recommend to most people. The 13-inch iPad Air M3. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $738 ($61 off) : We gave the 13-inch iPad Air a review score of 89 earlier this month. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 128GB model. Apple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off) : The iPad Pro is more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being how expensive it all is. This deal on doesn’t truly lessen that — and it’s another deal we’ve seen multiple times in recent months — but it still ties the 13-inch model’s all-time low.

    "description": "We’ve reviewed plenty of cooking gear — and the best of those gadgets are rarely cheap. There’s nothing like a good sale to take the sting out of outfitting your kitchen with new appliances and Amazon’s Big Spring Sale happens to have a lot of kitchen tech on sale right now. We’ve combed through the many, many pages of what’s discounted and found what’s worthy of checking out. Right now, a lot of the kitchen tech we’ve tried and recommend is seeing sizable discounts. So if you’ve been pondering an Instant Pot, sous vide machine or an air fryer , now is a good time to grab something new. The best Amazon Spring Sale deals on air fryers, Instant Pots and more Cosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off) : Cosori’s fryer earned a spot as the runner up for best overall air fryer in our guide. It has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity. We like that it doesn’t take up too much space, but can still cook up a decent amount of food Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off) : If you want a more traditional toaster oven design with a huge capacity, go for our premium air fryer pick. The fryer-and-oven combo can accommodate a five-quart dutch oven, so it’s almost an auxiliary oven, which could come in handy when you’re cooking for a crowd. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it went for $300 at the end of last year. Breville the Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off) : This is the non-Pro version of the Breville air fryer we recommend . It has a slightly smaller capacity (0.8 cubic feet instead of one cubic foot) and is missing two cooking functions (dehydrate and proof). But if you’re not making your own jerky or baking a ton of bread, this one can toast, broil, air fry and slow cook. You can even get it in cool colors like Red Velvet Cake for the same price. Mannkitchen Pepper Cannon for $160 ($40 off) : Our reviewer called this grinder one of his favorite kitchen gadgets . While he admits it’s a rather indulgent purchase, it does rather impressively crank out far more pepper per turn than other mills, and the grind coarseness is highly adjustable to perfectly pepper your food. Ninja DZ401 Foodi 10-quart air fryer for $190 ($40 off) : If you need to air fry two different foods at once, go for our recommendation for a dual-zone air fryer. It’s a beast, so we think it’s best for larger kitchens and people who make big meals. It went as low as $130 for Black Friday last year, but this is the cheapest price we’ve seen since then. Instant Vortex 2QT Mini Air Fryer for $50 ($10 off) : The budget pick in our guide doesn’t go on sale often — it’s already pretty cheap at its $60 list price. It’s sold for as little as $48 for Prime Day in July, but this is the cheapest we’ve seen since then. Its two-quart capacity is probably best for small kitchens and can crisp up food for one or two people. Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $90 $40 off) : We like this Instant Pot model because it&#39;s simple to use and has several quick-cooking modes including beans, cake, sous vide and more. It went as low as $70 earlier this year, but this is still a 30 percent discount off the list price. Instant Pot Pro Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $125 ($75 off) : We also suggest this fancier Pro Plus model in our guide to kitchen tech . It’s a Wi-Fi connected unit with a canning function and you can even release the steam remotely using the companion app — which has over 800 recipes. This matches the lowest price we saw earlier this year, but is still a bit more than its $99 all-time low. Ninja AF150AMZ Air Fryer for $120 (25 percent off) : This went as low as $100 for the holidays last year, but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen since then. The fryer gets an honorable mention in our air fryer guide because it makes good use of limited counter space with its taller design. The round cooking basket doesn’t feel as roomy as square ones but it does have a dehydrate option that other cookers don’t come with. Anova Culinary Sous Vide 3.0 for $129 ($70 off) : We named this the best overall sous vide machine after testing a number of models for our buyer’s guide. This is about $30 more than the low it hit for the holidays last year, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. We appreciate the easy digital controls and found that the high flow rate maintains water temperature better than other machines. Plus, if you’re at a loss for what to cook, you can check out the companion app which is replete with recipes. Cosori Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $60 ($10 off) : This kettle earned a spot in our list of favorite small kitchen appliances. It has different built-in temperature settings for different types of drinks and an elegant gooseneck pour. This is a price it has hit many times before, but is a chance to save $10 over the usual MSRP. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $165 ($30 off) : This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. This is the pro model of the version we recommend in our tea guide . KitchenAid Artisan 5-quart stand mixer for $380 ($80 off) : Small wonder that the home cook’s gold standard of mixers made its way onto our kitchen tech guide . Its ton of available attachments can be used to make pasta, grind food, strain or spiralize fruits and veggies and more. This is no unitasker. This is a solid $80 discount off of the MSRP, but we’ll note that Amazon sold it for as low as $330 at the end of last year and for $350 last month. KitchenAid Go Cordless Hand Blender for $100 ($30 off) : The big selling point here is the removable battery that you can use for other KitchenAid Go appliances. In our testing, it had enough power to turn a roasted butternut squash into a smooth, creamy soup. The blender has hit this price a few times over the past few months and the deal isn’t as good as the $77 it sold for at the end of last year. Cosori Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $60 ($10 off) : This kettle earned a spot in our list of favorite small kitchen appliances. It has different built-in temperature settings for different types of drinks and an elegant gooseneck pour. This is a price it has hit many times before, but is a chance to save $10 over the usual MSRP.

    "description": "We hear Signal is in the news . As longtime fans of the app, and secure messaging more broadly, we feel like it&#39;s our duty at Engadget to ensure you know how to use the software properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download Signal Signal is available on Android and iOS , as well as nearly every desktop operating system, including Windows and macOS. You can download the app by clicking one of the links provided above, or typing in &quot;Signal Messenger&quot; in your device&#39;s app store. Once you&#39;ve installed the app, proceed to set up an account using your phone number or an alias.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: If you want to install Signal on a workplace phone or computer, be sure to obtain approval from your employer; some organizations, such as the US government, either actively discourage or downright disallow use of the app.&nbsp; Create a new group Wonderful, you&#39;ve downloaded Signal! Now, to create a group chat, follow these steps:&nbsp; Tap the compose icon at the top of the interface.&nbsp; Select New Group. Add participants by selecting their name from your contact list, or inputting their username or phone number.&nbsp; Give your group a name (and a profile picture if you want).&nbsp; If the contents are especially sensitive, you may wish to enable Disappearing Messages and select an expiration time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#39;re in the process of adding new participants to a group, be sure to verify you&#39;re adding the right people. &nbsp; Some useful tips I would also suggest making use of Signal&#39;s Permissions feature to limit who can invite people to your chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings.&nbsp; Scroll down and select Permissions. Under &quot;Add Members,&quot; tap Only Admins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways someone can join your group chat is through a group link or QR Code . For additional security, you can set it so that admins must approve group link invites before the invitee can join.&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Scroll down and select Group Link.&nbsp; Switch the toggle to on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you know exactly who you can trust, but the guy down the hall might not! If you tend to get mixed up on names easily, Signal allows you to assign nicknames to users. After all, no one wants a case of mistaken identity. Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to assign a nickname to.&nbsp; Type in a name. You can also add a note, say describing the person&#39;s profession, in case you need additional context.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicknames are only visible to you, so don&#39;t be embarrassed to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp; How to remove someone from your group chat Look, even the best of us can make mistakes. Thankfully, Signal makes it easy to remove someone from a conversation thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to remove.&nbsp; Tap Remove From Group.&nbsp; How to delete messages in a Signal group chat So you somehow got through all of the above steps, added someone you shouldn&#39;t have and sent information that a relative stranger likely shouldn&#39;t have seen. Lets be honest, you&#39;re an edge case. But there&#39;s still hope if you caught your mistakes early.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap and hold the message on mobile (or hover the message bubble on desktop), Select Delete. Select Delete for Everyone. Now there&#39;s less chance of, for instance, a record of your civil and perhaps even criminal mishaps being shared to a notable reporter in a form potentially open to legal discovery.&nbsp; Ultimately, no matter how secure the messaging platform, if what you need to talk about is very, very sensitive, it&#39;s probably best to just &quot; get everyone in a room together .&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-add-someone-to-a-signal-group-chat-201430756.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals: The best sales from Shark, iRobot, Dyson and others",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-robot-vacuum-deals-the-best-sales-from-shark-irobot-dyson-and-others-092652375.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is only in its second year and, so far, we’ve found it to focus less on tech deals and more on home, cleaning and fashion discounts. That perhaps makes sense considering its timing, spring is a time for renewal and a refresh after all. But luckily, tech and home cleaning neatly intersect in the category of robot vacuums. We’ve tested dozens of these handy automatic floor cleaners and put the results in our buying guides . Right now, a number of our picks and related models are on sale so we’ve rounded up the best deals on vacuums Amazon’s latest sale has to offer. The best Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac for $400 ($350 off) : In our testing, we’ve been consistently impressed with Shark vacuums — but they’re not cheap. This machine can mop in addition to vacuum and is nearly half price at 47 percent off. Shark Robot PowerDetect NeverTouch vac and mop combo for $500 ($400 off) : This is the non-pro model of our runner up pick for the best combo bot. It mops and vacuums, quickly making a map of your home on its first run. The app easily lets you program where your hard and carpeted surfaces are, as well as set schedules. The base empties the dry debris and dirty water, then refills it with new water. The difference between this model and the Pro version is that this one doesn’t clean the mop with each use, so you may need to manually perform that task more often — but the price difference may make up for that lack. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off) : This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX for $140 (44 percent off) : The “S” in the model name stands for “slim” and it was one of the more low-profile machines we tried. It’s a pick in our guide to budget robot vacuums and has a long battery life and good suction power for its price. The main drawback is the lack of Wi-Fi, so instead of programming it with your phone, you’ll use the included remote. The best cordless vacuum deals Tineco Pure ONE Station 5 for $349 ($110 off) : This vac earned an honorable mention in our tests. The self-emptying base is a big selling point. We also liked the auto-adjusting suction and single-button start feature. The fact that it doesn’t require proprietary bags helps keep down the long-term cost, too. &nbsp; Tineco Pure ONE S11 cordless vacuum for $205 ($95 off with coupon) : Click the coupon to get $95 off our top pick for a budget stick vac. We like that it automatically adjusts suction depending on what it&#39;s picking up and is relatively lightweight when you’re pushing it around your floors. The bin is on the small side and the battery life isn’t as good as on other models, but it’s an easy-to-use, no-frills way to clean floors. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off) : This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Tineco Pure ONE Station FurFree for $400 ($300 off) : Of all the stick vacs our reviewer tried for our guide , this is the one she wanted to use the most. It’s super convenient with a dock that charges and empties and cleans all parts of the machine — brush, tube and dustbin — after each use. Plus the suction power is great and the iLoop smart sensor kicks up the suction when needed.

    "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed again. Publisher Paradox Interactive announced today that it is now targeting release in October 2025 instead of the first half of this year. &quot;Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date,&quot; the company said. Creating the sequel has been a trial of endurance that would test even an immortal undead&#39;s patience. Paradox parted ways with the game&#39;s original developer, Hardsuit Labs, in 2021. The Chinese Room, which made notable indie games Dear Esther and Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture , joined the project as developer in 2023. Today&#39;s update from offered some encouragement that the project is now in &quot;a late development stage,&quot; however it has decided to discontinue dev diaries that offered behind-the-scenes peeks at progress. The original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines game came out in 2004 after its own challenging development. Made by the now-shuttered Troika Studios, it was an story-driven game inspired by a tabletop RPG about several vampire clans in a modern-day Los Angeles. It was a commercial flop, but acquired a loyal audience over the years and even cultivated a community for mods and fan games .

    "description": "If you live in a rural area of the UK, you may soon be able to use your phone for satellite calls, messages and other standard data use. On Tuesday, the nation&#39;s telecom regulator, Ofcom, proposed using direct-to-device satellite tech to connect people in the UK&#39;s &quot;most rural and hard-to-reach places,&quot; like mountains and remote villages. Ofcom sees the tech complementing traditional networks, aiming to provide 100 percent mobile coverage in the UK. The regulator said the tech could also provide backup coverage during outages, offer service to ships and passengers in coastal waters without a connection and provide emergency 999 services (the UK&#39;s version of 911) in remote areas. In January, British telecom Vodafone made the world&#39;s first satellite video call using a standard mobile phone on a remote mountain in west Wales. Regarding the regulatory details, Ofcom suggests amending existing mobile spectrum licenses for frequencies already used by cellular providers (below 3 GHz). However, the regulator also offered alternative approaches, including introducing a new license for satellite services or allowing license-exempt use if certain conditions are met. Regardless of its specific policy approach, Ofcom said strict conditions would be attached to avoid interference with existing spectrum users in the UK and overseas. Ofcom is opening a consultation period with stakeholders from now to May 20. Depending on the feedback it receives, it could begin authorizing direct-to-device calls later this year.&nbsp; The iPhone 14 series was the first standard handset to offer direct-to-satellite emergency messaging . In iOS 18, Apple expanded the functionality beyond crises to any situation where you&#39;re off the grid . The Samsung Galaxy S25 series and Google Pixel 9 recently added similar functionality .

    "description": "Sunderfolk , a game that borrows elements from tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and couch party games like Jackbox, has a launch date. The fantasy RPG from Dreamhaven (the stomping ground of Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime ) arrives on April 23. You can play a demo today through April 7. While virtual tabletops like Wizards of the Coast&#39;s Sigil act as video game-like extensions of a traditional tabletop experience, Sunderfolk &#39;s premise is in using modern technology to simulate something like D&amp;D — but with more accessibility to casual players. Here, your phone becomes the deck of cards (and controller), while your TV or monitor is the game board. Although it supports remote play, this one sounds tailor-made for couch co-op. The game&#39;s story retreads familiar fantasy tropes, like a town of peaceful inhabitants invaded by dark and creepy monsters. Here, the heroes are a clan of anthropomorphic animals who each fit a familiar class like arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger or rogue. You can customize each with weapons, armor, items and skills as they level up. (When in doubt, play the classics!) Dreamhaven &quot;We were, with Sunderfolk, really trying to create something that would inspire people to get together in person,&quot; Game Director Erin Marek said in a preview trailer. &quot;We wanted it to feel similar to a game night, getting together to play a board game or getting together to play D&amp;D with a group of friends or family or loved ones that you really care about. And to share that experience together side-by-side.&quot; You can gather your cohorts to try the game for free on GeForce Now from now to April 7. The preview gives you access to all playable characters and an early part of the game. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need a paid GeForce membership ; a free account will do. Sunderfolk will cost $50 and be playable Steam , PS5 , Xbox Series X and Switch. But only the party member running the big-screen device needs to own the game; the phone app (iOS and Android) for your pals will be a free download when the game launches on April 23.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-releases-gemini-25-ai-model-for-complex-thinking-182352224.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Google has the pedal to the metal on its AI development. Just a few months after the debut of Gemini 2.0 , the tech giant has unveiled another upgrade in Gemini 2.5 . As with any new AI launch, Google is touting a strong performance on LMArena for Gemini 2.5, particularly its capabilities in coding, mathematics and science. The first model in this series is Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Google said this is a thinking model that&#39;s intended to provide responses grounded in more reasoning, analysis and context than the answers offered by classification- and prediction-driven models. It&#39;s a different approach than Google took with the Gemini 2.0 series, which started off with the more efficient and less expensive Flash version. &quot;With Gemini 2.5, we&#39;ve achieved a new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training,&quot; the company said in a blog post attributed to Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO of Google DeepMind. &quot;Going forward, we’re building these thinking capabilities directly into all of our models, so they can handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.&quot; Google had only just started rolling out Gemini 2.0 to its services, using it to power the newly added AI Mode in search and Deep Research for handling more complex queries. With today&#39;s launch, expect to hear more updates from the company about getting this latest version. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is available now in Google AI Studio, and Gemini Advanced members can use it directly in the Gemini app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-releases-gemini-25-ai-model-for-complex-thinking-182352224.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI just announced that all users will soon be able to generate images directly inside of ChatGPT. It’s rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team and, most importantly, Free users. This will be the default image generation tool in 4o, so there will be no need to open Dall-E whenever you want to whip up a picture of a cat in space eating lasagna or whatever. The feature’s also coming to Sora. The company says that the platform will &quot;generate high-quality images based on your prompt, conversation and uploaded files.&quot; To the latter point, it’ll be able to transform pre-existing images based on prompts. OpenAI is also boasting about significant improvements in text rendering and contextual understanding. These new tools are intended for both personal and professional use. As such, OpenAI gives a number of examples as to where this type of image generation could come in handy. These include the creation of infographics, social media promotional graphics and images with plenty of text, as seen below.&nbsp; OpenAI This being a modern generation tool, it can also handle high-end visuals. The company says it offers a &quot;strong capability for photorealism, including light, shadow, and texture accuracy.&quot; The ability to understand context could also be useful, as OpenAI says this could be used to create a “poster of birds found in Central Park” or a &quot;visualization of an art history era discussed previously in the conversation.&quot; Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqN Text and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx — OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 13, 2024 It&#39;s built on GPT-4o, an AI model that was first released last year . The &quot;o&quot; stands for &quot;omni&quot;, which is a reference to the model’s multimodal capabilities. This is what allows many of the aforementioned features, like being able to iterate on uploaded files. Today’s news looks like another step on the long road toward the “one AI to rule them all” functionality that Sam Altman teased a few weeks back .

The company is usually consistent with its event timing, so Tim Cook will probably take the stage to start the keynote on June 9 at 10AM PT/1PM ET. We&#39;ve already heard that iOS 19 and macOS 16 will be sporting new looks , so expect a focus on the latest software changes. And there&#39;s no way we won&#39;t be getting more Apple Intelligence updates. It was a core part of the iOS 18.3 update that rolled out at the start of the year and Apple has had struggles with some of the AI-powered features, particularly its notification summaries . One thing we don&#39;t anticipate seeing is the long-awaited update to Siri that will offer more personalization, also courtesy of Apple Intelligence. That project hit a delay in March and, no matter how hard we might hope otherwise , it seems unlikely the issues will all be resolved by June. Although the keynote is happening in-person at Apple Park, the rest of WWDC will take place online and is free for developers to attend.

    "description": "It&#39;s your lucky day if you&#39;re looking for good deals on Apple devices . Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , the Apple Watch Series 10 has dropped to its lowest price to date. The smartwatch is back on sale for a record-low price of $299. That&#39;s a $100 discount. The Apple Watch SE got a discount too. The device typically retails for $249, but you can snap it up for $169 . The Apple Watch Series 10 is our pick for the best smartwatch overall . That may not necessarily apply if you&#39;re an Android user, since you need an iPhone to actually use an Apple Watch. In any case, we gave the Apple Watch Series 10 a score of 90 in our review . Apple&#39;s current flagship smartwatch has a bigger screen, making it easier to see your notifications and health data (it&#39;s a pretty dang great device for wellness and fitness tracking). The thinner frame makes it more aesthetically pleasing too. On the downside, losing the blood oxygen feature from previous models is a bummer, but that issue was out of Apple&#39;s hands to a certain extent . It&#39;s perhaps not quite worth an upgrade if you have a Series 8 or 9 already. Apple isn&#39;t exactly reinventing the wheel here. Plus the sleep apnea detection feature that debuted alongside the Series 10 is also available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Still, if you&#39;re an Apple Watch newcomer or upgrading from an even older model, the Series 10 is likely your best option, especially for the sake of future proofing.

    "description": "Waymo is continuing to expand its foothold across the US, having recently started offering paid robotaxi services in more parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. Next up are Atlanta and Miami , and now the company has revealed plans to offer its driverless Waymo One service in the nation&#39;s capital in 2026. Before that can happen, though, Waymo will need to get approval from regulators. The company says it will &quot;continue to work closely with policymakers to formalize the regulations needed to operate without a human behind the wheel in the District.&quot; DC currently requires autonomous vehicles to have a human at the wheel, ready to take control if necessary. “Our priority remains ensuring that any company operating in the District — such as Waymo — does so in a manner that prioritizes safety, aligns with our regulatory framework, and integrates seamlessly into DC’s unique transportation ecosystem,” German Vigil, a spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, told The Washington Post . He noted that the agency is refining its approach to regulation &quot;based on public input, emerging best practices and lessons learned” from other jurisdictions. Waymo has tested its vehicles in DC for several years and it plans to &quot;continue introducing ourselves to DC’s communities and emergency responders over the coming months.&quot; Per the Post , if and when Waymo One does become available in the District, the robotaxis would not take riders to any of the region&#39;s airports, as they wouldn&#39;t (at least at the outset) have a permit to cross into Maryland or Virginia.

    "description": "Instagram is adding another tool to its arsenal of anti-bullying measures. This time, however, Meta is enlisting school officials directly in an effort to speed up its response to safety issues affecting young teens. The company is introducing a new “Schools Partnership Program” that aims to give teachers and school administrators a way to intervene when students experience bullying on Instagram. The program offers schools something that many parents have long said they wanted: a way to fast-track in-app reports that directly affect young students. Meta is promising that schools who join the program will have their reports “prioritized” in its moderation queue, and that it will respond to these reports within 48 hours. Schools that sign up will also get a “school partner” badge appended to their Instagram account, along with in-app information about how to use its reporting tools and other resources. Notably though, it doesn’t sound like Meta is hiring additional content moderators to aid with these new fast-tracked reports. When asked about increasing headcount to support the program, an Instagram spokesperson told Engadget only that reports from schools will be “expedited” via its existing reporting channels, and that schools will be able to add &quot;additional context&quot; to their reports. Meta says it’s already tested the program with 60 schools and that early results have been “promising.” Now, middle schools and high schools in the United States can sign up to join a waitlist for the program. The pilot program is far from the first time Instagram has tried to address bullying. The app introduced comment limiting features in 2021 , and added a tougher &quot; restrict &quot; feature last year. But while these features can help teens avoid certain types of negative interactions, they still required teens (or their parents) to tweak their settings. By now giving schools more authority to report specific instances of bullying or other bad behavior, Meta is offering some hope that it will be easier for schools to address the underlying behavior.

    "description": "When Sony&#39;s wireless earbuds come to mind, the flagship-quality WF-1000XM5 is probably the first product that jumps out. However, the company is also adept at building budget models, blending features and tech to give users a solid value for a lot less money. That was the proposition when the WF-C700N arrived in 2023 , offering active noise cancellation (ANC), solid battery life and other features for $120. Now, Sony is back with the successor to those earbuds, the WF-C710N , that packs a host of improvements but keeps the price the same.&nbsp; First, Sony says it improved ANC performance by employing dual mics on each earbud on the C710N. The C700N only had one on each side. The company is also using AI Noise Reduction this time around to improve call quality. On the outside, Sony replaced the physical button for the onboard controls with a touch panel, and the company added wear detection for added convenience.&nbsp; You can also expect longer battery life on the C710N. At 8.5 hours with ANC enabled, that&#39;s an hour longer than the C700N. With ANC off, you can expect up to two hours more than the previous model. Additionally, total battery life including the case is doubled, with up to 30 hours of noise-canceling use available (up to 40 hours with ANC off). Sony improved the quick charge feature as well, giving you an hour of play time in five minutes instead of the previous 10-minute window. The WF-C710N is available for preorder today in black, white, pink and a transparent Glass Blue for $120. I guess Sony&#39;s confusing product names aren&#39;t entirely going away after all.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-overhauls-its-budget-earbuds-while-keeping-the-price-the-same-010025194.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Discord has begun rolling out a redesigned desktop app that adds more customization to the client. To start, the new app increases the number of free themes to four. Where previously you could choose between two skins — light and dark — if you weren&#39;t a Nitro subscriber, now your options are light, ash, dark and onyx. In short, everyone gets access to more dark themes. Discord has also added three new UI density options — default, spacious and compact. These are separate from the app&#39;s existing message layout options, so it&#39;s another way to tweak the look and feel of the interface. With this redesign, the company is also finally giving users the option to resize the channel list. Discord has also redesigned the controls that appear when you&#39;re on a voice or video call. Now, more of the buttons you may want to press during a call will appear in the center bar along the bottom of the screen. At the same time, the mic and camera buttons feature more color, so you have a better indicator if you&#39;re muted or your camera is active. &quot;All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,&quot; Discord explains. Discord Separately, the redesigned app ships with a new overlay that Discord says is faster and won&#39;t impact game performance. Taking a page Valve&#39;s recent redesign of Steam , Discord has reworked the interface around widgets, meaning you can move around each individual element as you wish. The company has also re-engineered the overlay so that it doesn&#39;t &quot;hook&quot; itself into games. As a result, it&#39;s less likely to trigger anti-cheat systems like BattleEye . In turn, that means the new overlay is compatible with &quot;a larger portion of the most-played games on Discord.&quot; It&#39;s even possible to watch a friend&#39;s stream directly from the new overlay. The redesigned app and overlay arrive after Discord CEO Jason Citron announced last May the company would refocus on building the best possible communications tool for gamers. In 2020, Discord briefly rebranded itself as a general purpose chat app after many young people turned to the platform to stay in touch with their friends during lockdown. &quot;After taking stock of the world now that the pandemic is largely behind us, and learning directly from you about how Discord can be even more useful, we&#39;ve recognized the need to narrow our focus from broadly being a community-centric chat app to being a place that helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests,&quot; Citron wrote last year. The update also arrives at what could be a pivotal moment for Discord. According to a recent New York Times report , the company could go public as early as later this year. With 72 percent of Discord users regularly gaming on PC, ensuring those people are taken care of ahead of a potential IPO takes on a sense of urgency.

    "description": "The once-iconic music-sharing platform Napster just sold for $207 million, according to reporting by CNBC . A company called Infinite Reality ponied up the cash. What could Napster offer in 2025 to warrant such a price tag? Infinite Reality CEO John Acunto says it’ll be used for marketing in the metaverse. In other words, a platform from 1999 will be used as part of a technology that seemingly peaked in 2021. That sounds about right. More specifically, the company plans on creating virtual 3D spaces for music fans to attend concerts and listening parties, in addition to creating a sales platform for musicians and labels to sell merch. This isn’t the worst idea in the world, as attending these kinds of shared events is probably my favorite aspect of VR. &quot;The most legendary collab?! Infinite Reality has acquired iconic online music brand @Napster . With this acquisition, we&#39;re expanding and reimagining Napster, empowering artists with new audience monetization and engagement capabilities, underpinned by iR’s #immersive … pic.twitter.com/L4Fig7QFct — Infinite Reality (@Infinite_iR) March 25, 2025 “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” Acunto said. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.” Napster holds numerous licenses to stream millions of songs, which is what made it an attractive prospect to Infinite Reality. The company says its version of Napster will “disrupt legally.” Current Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos says that the purchase will allow artists to create “crazy environments that are really only limited by their imaginations.” As an example, he described a reggae artist who might enjoy a virtual beach environment. Acunto adds that it’ll be like “Clubhouse times a trillion.” He’s referring to the virtual events app that became popular during COVID , but eventually petered out. Infinite Reality has been on a buying spree the last couple of years. In addition to Napster, it purchased the Drone Racing League , the metaverse marketing platform Landvault and the VR shopping platform Obsess . As for Napster, it started in 1999 and took the world by storm, creating an easy-peasy way to steal music. It only took a couple of years for mounting legal battles to catch up to the platform and it declared bankruptcy in 2001. However, that was just the beginning . The software company Roxio purchased the platform in 2002 and relaunched it as a legitimate e-commerce venture that sold digital music files. In 2008, Best Buy came calling and scooped it up. The retail giant only held on to Napster for a few years before selling to Rhapsody in 2011 . Rhapsody tried to make Napster a household name in Europe for the next decade before a consortium of blockchain companies, led by Hivemind and Algorand, bought it in 2022 . These companies had plans to do some kind of NFT-based nonsense, because “music x web3 is one of the most exciting spaces.” That didn’t work and, well, here we are. Here’s to another 25 years of being passed around like a hot potato.

    "description": "It&#39;s no secret that Dyson devices are pricey, but you can find good sales on them if you&#39;re patient and know where to look. Case in point, the Amazon Spring Sale : not only are a few Dyson cordless vacuums included amongst the discounts, but this Dyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus heater and fan is as well. You can snag it for $300, or $170 off its usual price. As its name suggests, the Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus can heat your room in the winter and cool it off in the summer. Its fan mode includes Air Multiplier tech, which creates a smooth and uninterrupted airstream thanks to its lack of traditional fan blades. When you need some warmth, its ceramic plates heat up quickly. The appliance has two modes: focused and diffused. Focused mode warms or cools one person, while diffused mode heats your entire room or provides a gentle breeze during the summer. It oscillates at a 70-degree angle. Dyson&#39;s fan has a sleep timer with a shutoff range between 15 minutes and nine hours, and you can store its curved and magnetized remote control inside the appliance to help prevent it from being lost. The lowest we&#39;ve ever seen this product&#39;s price drop is $280, so being able to snag it for $300 in the middle of March, when we&#39;re nowhere near Black Friday or Prime Day, is about as good a deal as you can hope for. If you&#39;re on the market for other Dyson gear , a few more devices are included in the Amazon Spring Sale, including the Dyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum on discount for $330.

    "description": "Apple plans to start using images it collects for Maps to train its AI models. In a disclosure spotted by 9to5Mac , the company said starting this month it would use images it captures to provide its Look Around feature for the additional purpose of training some of its generative AI models. Look Around is Apple&#39;s answer to Google Street View. The company originally released the feature alongside its 2019 revamp of Apple Maps . The tool allows users to see locations from ground level. Apple blurs faces and license plates photographed in Look Around images to protect the privacy of any individuals caught in its survey efforts. &quot;In addition to improving Apple Maps and the algorithms that blur faces and license plates in images published in Look Around feature, Apple also will use blurred imagery collected during surveys conducted beginning in March 2025 to develop and improve other Apple products and services,&quot; the company writes in the disclosure. &quot;This includes using data to train models powering Apple products and services, including models related to image recognition, creation, and enhancement.&quot; Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget&#39;s request for more information. The company&#39;s Apple Maps image collection policy page provides a list of regions and dates when it plans to collect new images for Look Around. People can find when Apple&#39;s survey crews and vehicles plan to visit their area by sorting by country and then clicking on a specific region. Apple currently offers a few different features that rely on image generation models. Image Playground, for instance, allows owners of Apple Intelligence -compatible devices to write a prompt to create a new image. There&#39;s also Clean Up in Photos, which you can use to remove objects from your favorite snapshots. Google has been using Street View images to train AI models for years. In 2017, for example, a pair of researchers from the company trained a machine learning model to generate professional-looking photographs from a dataset collected from Street View.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-will-use-its-street-view-maps-photos-to-train-ai-models-150919972.html?src=rss",

That remote also has Netflix and Prime Video buttons, but the device can run most streaming apps, like Disney+ and Peacock.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-deals-include-the-fire-tv-stick-hd-for-only-20-144514114.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Anker 321 MagGo power bank has been discounted to $20 as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . This is a record low price and represents a discount of 23 percent. A whole bunch of colorways are on sale here, including white, black, pink, green and purple. Anker products are all over our list of the best power banks and portable chargers , so this device is in good company. The 321 MagGo is, as the name suggests, a magnetic power bank that snaps onto the back of smartphones. It works with cases, so long as the case is magnetic. Inside, there’s a 5,000mAh battery that provides up to 19 hours of additional use for modern iPhones. It’s equipped with heat sensors that continuously monitor temperatures to avoid accidental damage and it can juice up a phone while it’s being charged itself. This power bank is also on the smaller side, so it easily fits into pockets, bags and purses. The only downside is that this is only for Prime members. However, the Anker Nano 3-in-1 portable charger is on sale for everyone. This non-magnetic charger includes a large 10,000mAh battery and is currently $35 . Even some of Anker&#39;s latest power banks and chargers that it debuted at CES have discounts as part of the Spring Sale as well.

    "description": "Apple may avoid a fine in one of the European Union investigations it&#39;s currently the subject of. The bloc&#39;s executive arm, the European Commission, will next week end a probe into whether Apple hindered iPhone users from easily changing their browser or search engine, according to Reuters . Apple is said to have complied with rules laid out under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to make it a cinch for users to switch to alternative browsers, social media platforms and other online services while giving smaller rivals a better chance to compete. Violations of the DMA, legislation that broadly seeks to keep the power of Big Tech in check, can lead to a fine of up to 10 percent of a company&#39;s total annual revenue, and up to 20 percent for repeat offenses. However, Apple may not be entirely off the hook. Per the report, the EU is set to dish out fines to both that company and Meta. The second Apple case concerns whether the company inhibited app developers from freely informing users about alternate payment options that are available away from the App Store ecosystem. As for Meta, it was reported this week that the EU may fine the company north of $1 billion for violating DMA rules as a result of its &quot;consent or pay&quot; ad-free subscription option in the region.

    "description": "Now that the Amazon Spring Sale is here, we&#39;re on the lookout for the best tech deals to grab from it. In typical Amazon fashion, Blink security cameras have been discounted for the shopping event. The Blink Mini 2 is available for $20 , which is half off its regular price and the best discount we&#39;ve seen. You can pick up two of the wired security cameras for $38, which represents a 46 percent discount. We reckon the Blink Mini 2 is the best budget security camera around. You can adjust the webcam-style camera to a variety of angles. It&#39;s weather-resistant, so you can place it outside if you have a special power adapter. The camera picks up decent (but not great) images, particularly those captured in the infrared nighttime view. It also has a built-in LED spotlight. Since Blink is an Amazon company, of course the Mini 2 ties into the Alexa ecosystem. You&#39;ll just need to have a Blink account before you can actually use it. As you might expect, you&#39;ll be able to view images captured by the Mini 2 via the Alexa app on an Echo Show, Fire Tablet or Fire TV but, curiously, not iOS or Android. To see the captures on your phone or tablet, you&#39;ll instead need to use the Blink app. You&#39;ll get some extra features — such as cloud storage and people and pet detection — if you sign up for the Blink Subscription ($3 per month for one camera, $10 per month for any number). Elsewhere in the sale, a five-pack of the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras is half off at $200 . This is our recommendation for the best security camera for Alexa users . Having five of them should be enough for many folks to keep an eye on everything that&#39;s going on around their property.

    "description": "Starting today, DJs will have access to Apple Music&#39;s catalog of over 100 million songs through more hardware and software platforms. DJs of all skill levels can build and mix sets on AlphaTheta, Serato, Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark and RANE DJ. This news follows the initial debut of Apple Music integration with Algoriddim&#39;s djay Pro software last year. There&#39;s also a new name for the whole initiative: DJ with Apple Music . And yes, a subscription is required. This isn&#39;t to be confused with Apple Music&#39;s DJ Mixes, a separate program that began in 2021 . The idea there was to attract creators of said DJ mixes and sets to the platform by leveraging Shazam&#39;s technology (owned by Apple) to ensure proper royalties were paid out. Now, Apple says, it&#39;s giving DJs access to its music catalog so it can be used as a creative tool and so they can easily tap into their personal libraries. There&#39;s a new DJ with Apple Music category page in the streaming app with curated playlists, and each platform has its own curator page complete with practice material. Spotify used to allow integration with third-party DJ apps, but the service stopped doing so in 2020 . If you&#39;re looking for options, djay Pro works with Tidal and SoundCloud, in addition to Apple Music.

    "description": "The Amazon Spring Sale has made me jealous — I&#39;m envious of those who can now pick up Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM5 headphones at a record-low price, as someone who paid full price for them long ago. Our top picks for the best wireless headphones you can buy are on sale for $250, which represents a 38 percent discount and the best price we&#39;ve seen. The sale is available on the Silver and Smoky Pink models. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones are one of them. I&#39;ve raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they&#39;re so comfortable. I&#39;ve worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp; Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they&#39;re a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don&#39;t have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp; Their excellence on flights isn&#39;t the only reason we gave Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones a 95 in our review . They&#39;re also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound&#39;s quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don&#39;t fold up, but especially at this price, they&#39;re still such a great buy.&nbsp; This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don&#39;t quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

    "description": "Anker&#39;s Eufy 3-in-1 E20 robot vacuum is $150 off right now , as part of Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. That brings the price down to $400, which is a record low. For those averse to using Amazon, the deal is also available directly from the company . The E20 made our list of the best robot vacuums , and with good reason. We loved the hybrid functionality, as this robovac quickly transforms into a cordless stick vacuum and a handheld unit. This in no way impedes the overall performance, as we found the automatic cleaning mode to be top-tier. The self-emptying base also holds a lot, considering its compact size. We praised the proprietary app in our official review , as editing room maps is both quick and easy. All told, it only took the robovac ten minutes to scoot around the house and create an accurate map.&nbsp; The suction power of the robotic unit is strong enough for major cleaning tasks, but the same cannot be said of the stick vacuum attachment. The power is on the weaker side. Also, it doesn’t come with a wall mount for the stick vacuum. That costs extra, to the tune of around $30. Today’s savings more than makes up for that.

    "description": "If you can&#39;t open a window for whatever reason, an air purifier can help make the air in your home a bit more comfortable. One of our favorites, the Levoit Core 400S air purifier , is on sale for $187 thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . While that&#39;s not a record low — we&#39;ve seen it as low as $177 last year — it&#39;s still a good discount on one of the most convenient air purifiers for large spaces. This deal is part of a larger Levoit sale during the Spring Sale that includes other air purifiers, humidifiers and more. We’ve featured Levoit in our list of the best air purifiers for its strong performance and smart features. The Core 400S can cover rooms up to 1,980 square feet using a three-stage filtration system to capture allergens, dust, pet dander and smoke. It also includes a smart sensor that adjusts fan speed based on air quality, so you’re not running it at full blast when you don’t need to. One of the Levoit Core 400S’ biggest selling points is its low noise output, which makes it a good fit for bedrooms or home offices. If you need to knuckle down and get some work done without distraction whilst keeping your room’s air clean and fresh, even at higher speeds, it stays relatively quiet compared to bulkier purifiers. It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands. Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness. If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.

    "description": "If you’re looking for a budget-friendly robot vacuum that can handle both vacuuming and mopping, iRobot’s Roomba Combo Essential just hit its lowest price ever. Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , it’s down to $149 from $275, matching the lowest price we’ve seen. It previously dipped to $149 during the holiday season and earlier this year, but it’s unclear how long this deal will stick around this time. As you can see in our roundup of the best budget robot vacuums , we’ve consistently rated iRobot’s machines highly for their reliability and ease of use. The Roomba Combo Essential is a simple, no-frills option that both vacuums and mops, making it a solid pick for small apartments, dorm rooms or anyone who wants a cleaner floor without spending a fortune. The vacuum uses special multi-surface brushes to pick up dirt, dust and pet hair from hard floors and carpets. Unlike some budget models that struggle with transitions, this one automatically adjusts to different surfaces, so you won’t have to worry about it getting stuck. When it’s time to mop, the built-in mopping pad wipes down hard floors, tackling light spills and everyday messes. It’s not as advanced as iRobot’s higher-end models with precision scrubbing, but it’s a convenient way to keep your floors looking fresh with minimal effort. One of iRobot Roomba Combo Essential&#39;s most convenient features is its auto-adjusting cleaning power — the robot increases suction when it detects extra debris, so it’s more effective on high-traffic areas like entryways or around pet bowls. It also has cliff sensors to prevent it from tumbling down stairs and a low-profile design that helps it slip under some couches and other furniture for a more thorough clean. Despite it being an entry-level robot vacuum, the iRobot Roomba Combo Essential comes with app control and voice assistant support, so you can set cleaning schedules and initiate cleaning whether you’re at home lounging on the couch or away on vacation. For $150, this is a solid deal for an iRobot machine that can vacuum and mop, especially considering its usual $275 price tag. If you’ve been thinking about automating some of your floor cleaning, this is one of the most affordable ways to do it.

    "title": "The best vlogging cameras for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-vlogging-camera-151603452.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’re a content creator or YouTuber, Sony, Canon and other camera companies want your business. There are more vlogging-specific models than ever, with several new models having arrived since our last guide, including Fujifilm’s XM-5. Recent vlogging-specific models include Sony’s new ZV-E1 full-frame mirrorless that launched last year, DJI’s Osmo Pocket 3 and Canon’s compact PowerShot V10. Others in this guide, like the new Panasonic G9 II and Canon’s EOS R6 II are hybrid mirrorless cameras that offer vlogging as part of a larger toolset. Many have certain things in common, like flip-around screens, face- and/or eye-detect autofocus and stabilization. Prices, features and quality can vary widely, though. To that end, we’ve updated our guide with all the latest vlogging cameras designed for novice to professional creators, in all price ranges. Engadget has tested all of these to give you the best possible recommendations. Table of contents Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Upcoming cameras What to look for in a vlogging camera Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Best action and portable cameras If you’re just starting out in vlogging or need a small, rugged camera, an action cam might be your best bet. In general, they’re easy to use as you don’t have to worry about things like exposure or focus. Recent models also offer good electronic stabilization and sharp, colorful video at up to 4K and 60 fps. The downsides are a lack of control; image quality that’s not on par with larger cameras; and no zooming or option to change lenses. The best compact vlogging cameras Compact cameras are a step-up option from smartphones or action cameras, with larger sensors and much better image quality. At the same time, they’re not quite as versatile as mirrorless or DSLR cameras (and not necessarily cheaper) and they lack advanced options like 10-bit video. For folks who want the best possible quality without needing to think too much about their camera, however, it’s the best option. The best mirrorless vlogging cameras This is the class that has changed the most over the past couple of years, particularly in the more affordable price categories. Interchangeable lens cameras give you the most options for vlogging, offering larger sensors than compact cameras with better low-light sensitivity and shallower depth of field to isolate you or your subject. They also offer better control of your image with manual controls, log recording, 10-bit video and more. The drawbacks are extra weight compared to action or compact cameras, extra complexity and higher prices. Upcoming cameras If you’re not quite ready to buy, there are some interesting options on the horizon. Canon just teased a camera which could be the R50 V, likely to be a vlogging-focused update to the R50 I recommended. Canon may also announce the availability of the PowerShot V1, a compact camera with a Type 1.4 sensor that’s larger than the 1-inch sensors found on most compact cameras. Meanwhile, Panasonic just announced the S1R II, a 45-megapixel hybrid camera. Though the high resolution would suggest it’s mainly for photography, the S1R II can shoot 8K video at up to 30 fps and capture 5.7K 30 RAW internally. It’s fairly expensive, but considerably cheaper than other options including the Nikon Z8 and Canon EOS R5 II. That model is now on pre-order and set to start shipping by the end of March — stay tuned for Engadget’s review. What to look for in a vlogging camera Vlogging cameras are designed for filmmakers who often work alone and either use a tripod, gimbal, vehicle mount or just their hands to hold a camera. It has to be good not just for filming yourself, but other “B-roll” footage that helps tell your story. The number one requirement is a flip-around screen so you can see yourself while filming. Those can rotate up, down or to the side, but flipping out to the side is preferable so a tripod or microphone won’t block it. Continuous autofocus (AF) for video with face and eye detection is also a must. It becomes your camera “assistant,” keeping things in focus while you concentrate on your content. Most cameras can do that nowadays, but some still do it better than others. If you move around or walk a lot, you should look for a camera with built-in optical stabilization. Electronic stabilization is another option as long as you’re aware of the limitations. You’ll also need a camera with a fast sensor that limits rolling shutter, which can create a distracting jello “wobble” with quick camera movements. Steve Dent/Engadget 4K recording is another key feature. All cameras nowadays can shoot 4K up to at least 24 fps, but if possible, it’s better to have 4K at 60 or even 120 fps. If you shoot sports or other things involving fast movement, look for a model with at least 1080p at 120 fps for slow-motion recording. Video quality and color accuracy are other important considerations, especially for skin tones. Good light sensitivity helps for night shooting or concerts, and a log profile helps improve dynamic range in very bright or dark shooting conditions. If you want the best possible image quality and can afford it, get a camera that can record 4K with 10-bits (billions) of colors. That will give you more options when you go to edit. Don’t neglect audio either; if the quality is bad, your audience will disengage. Look for a camera with a microphone port so you can plug in a shotgun or lapel mic for interviews, or at least one with a good-quality built-in microphone. It’s also nice to have a headphone port to monitor sound so you can avoid nasty surprises after you’ve finished shooting. You’ll also want good battery life and, if possible, dual memory card slots for a backup. Finally, don’t forget about your camera’s size and weight. If you’re constantly carrying one while shooting, especially at the end of a gimbal or gorillapod, it might actually be the most important factor. That’s why tiny GoPro cameras are so popular for sports, despite offering lower image quality and fewer pro features.

    "description": "One of Samsung&#39;s CEOs, Jong-hee Han, has died due to a heart attack, according to Reuters and CNBC . He was 63. Han joined the company in 1988 and became the head of product research and development for visual display in 2011. He then led Samsung&#39;s TV business before he was named as the head of Samsung DX, which is what the company calls its merged mobile and consumer electronics divisions, in 2021. In 2022, he officially became the company&#39;s Vice Chairman and CEO. Han had no experience in mobile before he started leading the company&#39;s DX group, but Samsung gave him credit for helping it get to the top of global TV sales for 15 years.&nbsp; CNBC says Han was one of the executives who hosted Samsung&#39;s annual general shareholders meeting just a week ago and answered questions about the company&#39;s poor stock performance. During the meeting, Han apologized to the shareholders, telling them that Samsung &quot;failed to adequately respond to the rapidly evolving AI semiconductor market.&quot; He also told the shareholders that Samsung was having difficulties when it came to semiconductor-related mergers and acquisitions due to regulatory issues, but that the company was &quot;determined to produce some tangible results this year.&quot; Based on the notice Samsung published , Han&#39;s co-CEO Young-Hyun Jun is now the sole CEO of the company. Jun, who also heads Samsung&#39;s semiconductor business, was appointed as Han&#39;s co-CEO in November 2024. It&#39;s not clear whether Samsung is planning to appoint another CEO in the future.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-ceo-jong-hee-han-has-died-120029286.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The next feature for next-gen Apple Watches could be AI assistant-boosting cameras. Apple is reportedly working on adding cameras to future Apple Watch models to make them more like AI wearables, according to Bloomberg ’s Mark Gurman. Unlike the ancient watch cameras from decades ago, I’d expect the camera to be as subtle as front-facing cameras on an iPhone, not the giant units on the back. Cameras may not be for FaceTime calls or photography but could help the Apple Watch support AI features like Visual Intelligence, which can provide on-the-spot information. Gurman previously reported Apple is developing AirPods with a built-in camera for similar functionality. Do you know which company tried cramming a camera into its smartwatch? This one . That was also over a decade ago. Engadget Apple is contending with other Watch issues too: a rumored plastic Apple Watch SE has reportedly hit some development issues . According to Gurman (he’s a busy guy!): “The design team doesn’t like the look, and the operations team is finding it difficult to make the casing materially cheaper than the current aluminum chassis.” It’s been over two years since Apple released the second-generation Apple Watch SE. We even took a second look at the wearable , anticipating` an eventual replacement. — Mat Smith Get this delivered direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!

    "title": "The best monitors for every budget in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-monitor-130006843.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The good news when it comes to buying monitors is that there has never been more choice, with numerous options for every type of use ranging from productivity to content creation to gaming. The problem is that all that choice can make it challenging to decide which one is best for your particular needs and budget. In this guide we can help you make that decision and show you which factors are most important, whether they be color accuracy, size, ergonomics or refresh rates. We used that information to gather the top picks, including options from our own monitor reviews, to help you find the one that best fits your needs. Table of Contents Best monitors for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a monitor Best monitors for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a monitor Panel type The cheapest monitors are still TN (twisted nematic), which are strictly for gamers or office use. VA (vertical alignment) monitors are also relatively cheap, while offering good brightness and a high contrast ratio. However, content creators will find that LCD, IPS monitors (in-plane switching) deliver better color accuracy, pixel density, picture quality and viewing angles. If maximum brightness is important, a quantum dot LCD display is the way to go — those are typically found in larger displays. OLED monitors are now available and offer the best blacks and color reproduction, but they lack the brightness of LED or quantum dot displays. Plus, they’re expensive. The latest type of OLED monitor, called QD-OLED from Samsung, is now common among gaming monitors. The most notable advantage is that it can get a lot brighter, with recent models hitting up to 1,000 nits+ of peak brightness. MiniLEDs are now widely used in high-end displays. They’re similar to quantum dot tech, but as the name suggests, it uses smaller LED diodes that are just 0.2mm in diameter. As such, manufacturers can pack in up to three times more LEDs with more local dimming zones, delivering deeper blacks and better contrast. Screen size, resolution and display format Where 24-inch displays used to be more or less standard (and can still be useful for basic computing), 27-, 32-, 34- and even 42-inch displays have become popular for entertainment, content creation and even gaming these days. Nearly every monitor used to be 16:9, but it’s now possible to find 16:10 and other more exotic display shapes. On the gaming and entertainment side, we’re also seeing curved and ultrawide monitors with aspect ratios like 21:9. If you do decide to buy an ultrawide display, however, keep in mind that a 30-inch 21:9 model is the same height as a 24-inch monitor, so you might end up with a smaller display than you expected. A 4K monitor is nearly a must for content creators, and some folks are even going for 5K or all the way up to 8K. Keep in mind, though, that you’ll need a pretty powerful computer with a decent graphics card to drive all those sharp pixels. And 4K resolution should be paired with a screen size of 27 inches and up, or you won’t notice much difference between 1440p. At the same time, I wouldn’t get a model larger than 27 inches unless it’s 4K, as you’ll start to see pixelation if you’re working up close to the display. One new category to consider is portable monitors designed to be carried and used with laptops. Those typically come in 1080p resolutions and sizes from 13-15 inches. They usually have a lightweight kickstand-type support that folds up to keep things compact. HDR HDR adds vibrancy to entertainment and gaming – but be careful before jumping in. Some monitors that claim HDR on their marketing materials don’t even conform to a base standard. To be sure that a display at least meets minimum HDR specs, you’ll want to choose one with a DisplayHDR rating with each tier representing maximum brightness in nits. However, the lowest DisplayHDR 400 and 500 tiers may disappoint you with a lack of brightness, washed out blacks and mediocre color reproduction. If you can afford it, the best monitor to choose is a model with DisplayHDR 600, 1000 or True Black 400, True Black 500 and True Black 600. Where televisions typically offer HDR10 and Dolby Vision or HDR10+, most PC monitors only support the HDR10 standard, other than a few (very expensive) models. That doesn’t matter much for content creation or gaming, but HDR streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services won’t look quite as punchy. In addition, the best gaming monitors are usually the ones supporting HDR600 (and up), rather than content creation monitors – with a few exceptions. Refresh rate Refresh rate is a key feature, particularly on gaming monitors. A bare minimum nowadays is 60Hz, and 80Hz and higher refresh rates are much easier on the eyes. However, most 4K displays top out at 60Hz with some rare exceptions and the HDMI 2.0 spec only supports 4K at 60Hz, so you’d need at least DisplayPort 1.4 (4K at 120Hz) or HDMI 2.1. The latter is now available on a number of monitors, particularly gaming displays. However, it’s only supported by the latest NVIDIA RTX 3000- and 4000-series, AMD RX 6000-series GPUs. Inputs There are essentially three types of modern display inputs: Thunderbolt, DisplayPort and HDMI. Most monitors built for PCs come with the latter two, while a select few (typically built for Macs) will use Thunderbolt. To add to the confusion, USB-C ports may be Thunderbolt 3, and by extension, DisplayPort compatible, so you may need a USB-C to Thunderbolt or DisplayPort cable adapter depending on your display. Color bit depth Serious content creators should consider a more costly 10-bit monitor that can display billions of colors. If budget is an issue, you can go for an 8-bit panel that can fake billions of colors via dithering (often spec’d as “8-bit + FRC”). For entertainment or business purposes, a regular 8-bit monitor that can display millions of colors will be fine. Color gamut The other aspect of color is the gamut. That expresses the range of colors that can be reproduced and not just the number of colors. Most good monitors these days can cover the sRGB and Rec.709 gamuts (designed for photos and video respectively). For more demanding work, though, you’ll want one that can reproduce more demanding modern gamuts like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3 and Rec.2020 gamuts, which encompass a wider range of colors. The latter two are often used for film projection and HDR, respectively.

    "description": "Netflix has announced that it&#39;s adding support for HDR10+ streaming , on top of the existing HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats that are already offered on the streaming service. HDR10+ should offer greater visual fidelity on a per-frame basis for Netflix&#39;s frequently dark original programming. The company is enabling HDR10+ with the AV1 codec, the specification originally released in 2018 that&#39;s gradually become the standard for streaming 4K video without gobbling data. Netflix first adopted AV1 as a way to help customers save data while watching on their phone, but the compression tech works just as well for streaming large HDR files. Netflix is enabling HDR10+ on select popular titles now, and hopes to eventually offer all HDR content in the new format. Anyone with a Netflix Premium subscription and a device that supports both HDR10+ and AV1 (which includes most modern mobile phones and tablets) should be able to watch compatible content in HDR10+. After 4K, high dynamic range (HDR) has come to define the look of modern TV and movies, particularly on streaming. HDR content makes clear the stark differences between the light and dark parts of an image. The under-exposed, muddy quality of modern streaming TV is frequently due to an expectation that audiences will be viewing on a device that supports HDR. Without it, you can&#39;t see anything. With it, you can pick up all the various shades of gray that have become the norm in prestige TV.&nbsp; Netflix first rolled out support for HDR in 2016 with the debut of Marco Polo , and in the years since, has made supporting Dolby Vision and HDR10, the most common HDR format, the norm on its service. If you&#39;ve been watching Netflix on a display that already uses Dolby Vision, you likely won&#39;t notice a difference, but if you&#39;re TV only offers HDR10+, adding support for the format should make watching everything a little bit better.

    "description": "DNA testing company 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , following a tumultuous few years that included significant layoffs and a wide-ranging data breach . It plans to find a buyer and continue operations throughout the process, with the company&#39;s CEO, Anne Wojcicki, resigning to bid for the company independently. The Board of Directors&#39; Special Committee previously rejected a proposal from Wojcicki. &quot;We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities. We believe in the value of our people and our assets and hope that this process allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on for the benefit of customers and patients,&quot; said Mark Jensen, chair and member of the Special Committee, in a release . Jensen added that the company is committed to safeguarding customer data and that &quot;being transparent about the management of user data going forward, and data privacy will be an important consideration in any potential transaction.&quot; There was a time when 23andMe was all the rage, with everyone you knew sending samples of their saliva. However, things have declined since the company went public. It was once valued at $6 billion , but this month that number was less than $50 million. The company also laid off over 200 employees late last year. But, the largest hurdle came in 2023 when hackers accessed the information of 6.9 million customers — the breach started in April of that year, but 23andM3 noticed it five months later , in September. The company announced the leak that October . One year later, 23andMe settled a class action lawsuit for $30 million , following claims such as that the company failed to tell plaintiffs that they were specifically targeted for being of Chinese or Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Following the news, California Attorney General Rob Bonta recommended 23andMe customers delete their data as a precaution.

    "description": "23andMe has capped off a challenging few years by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy today. Given the uncertainty around the future of the DNA testing company and what will happen to all of the genetic data it has collected, now is a critical time for customers to protect their privacy. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has recommended that past customers of the genetic testing business delete their information as a precautionary measure. Here are the steps to deleting your records with 23andMe. Log into your 23andMe account. Go to the &quot;Settings&quot; tab of your profile. Click View on the section called &quot;23andMe Data.&quot; If you want to retain a copy for your own records, download your data now. Go to the &quot;Delete Data&quot; section Click &quot;Permanently Delete Data.&quot; You will receive an email from 23andMe confirming the action. Click the link in that email to complete the process. While the majority of an individual&#39;s personal information will be deleted, 23andMe does keep some information for legal compliance. The details are in the company&#39;s privacy policy . There are a few other privacy-minded actions customers can take. First, anyone who opted to have 23andMe store their saliva and DNA can request that the sample be destroyed. That choice can be made from the Preferences tab of the account settings menu. Second, you can review whether you granted permission for your genetic data and sample to be used in scientific research. The allowance can also be checked, and revoked if you wish, from the account settings page; it&#39;s listed under Research and Product Consents.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-midrange-smartphone-183006463.html?src=rss",
    "description": "A great phone doesn’t need to cost a fortune. In 2025, features once exclusive to high-end devices – big batteries, multi-camera arrays, high refresh rate displays and more – have trickled down to more affordable models. Sure, you’ll still need to buy a flagship smartphone to get the best camera or fastest processor, but you don’t need to compromise nearly as much anymore if you’re looking for a great handset at a reasonable price. If you have less than $600 to spend, let us help you figure out what features to prioritize when trying to find the best midrange smartphone. Editor&#39;s note (3/24/25): We&#39;re looking forward to testing out the new Google Pixel 9a in the near future. We&#39;ll update our top picks again once we have a full review of the Pixel 9a, but for now, our current top picks still stand. The best midrange phones for 2025 What is a midrange phone, anyway? While the term frequently appears in articles and videos, there isn’t an agreed-upon definition for “midrange” beyond a phone that isn’t a flagship or an entry-level option. Most of our recommendations cost between $400 and $600 — any less and you should expect significant compromises. If you have more to spend, you might as well consider flagships like the Apple iPhone 16 and the Samsung Galaxy S25 . What to consider before buying a midrange smartphone Buying a new device can be intimidating, but a few questions can help guide you through the process. First: what platform do you want to use? If the answer is iOS, that narrows your options down to exactly one phone. (Thankfully, it’s great.) And if you’re an Android fan, there’s no shortage of compelling options. Both platforms have their strengths, so you shouldn’t rule either out. Of course, also consider how much you’re comfortable spending. Even increasing your budget by $100 more can get you a dramatically better product. Moreover, manufacturers tend to support their more expensive devices for longer. It’s worth buying something toward the top limit of what you can afford. Having an idea of your priorities will help inform your budget. Do you want a long battery life or fast charging? Do you value speedy performance above all else? Or would you like the best possible cameras? While they continue to improve every year, even the best midrange smartphones still demand some compromises, and knowing what’s important to you will make choosing one easier. What won’t you get from a midrange smartphone? Every year, the line between midrange and flagship phones blurs as more upmarket features and specs trickle down to more affordable models. When Engadget first published this guide in 2020, it was tricky to find a $500 phone with waterproofing and 5G. In 2025, the biggest thing you might miss out on is wireless charging – and even then, that’s becoming less true. One thing your new phone probably won’t come with is a power adapter; many companies have stopped including chargers with all of their smartphones. Performance has improved in recent years, but can still be hit or miss as most midrange phones use slower processors that can struggle with multitasking. Thankfully, their cameras have improved dramatically, and you can typically expect at least a dual-lens system on most midrange smartphones below $600.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-adds-option-to-edit-continue-watching-list-182856588.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Disney is giving Disney+ subscribers the ability to edit their &quot;Continue Watching&quot; lists , a quality-of-life feature that&#39;s been oddly missing from the streaming service up until now. Continue Watching collects all of the TV shows, movies and live events you&#39;ve started watching, saving your place so you can pick up right where you left off. If you dip in and out of watching things, it&#39;s very easy for the list to get unwieldy quickly, so being able to edit it is helpful. You can remove something from Continue Watching in two different ways: directly from the list itself or the Details page of a given show or movie. If you&#39;re on your TV and want to edit your list, you just highlight a movie or show with your remote, press and hold the remote&#39;s button (on the Apple TV remote, for example, its the center button) and then select &quot;Remove&quot; when the menu slides over. From the Details page of the show or movie you want to remove, just highlight and select the &quot;Remove&quot; icon (it&#39;s a minus symbol) to get it out of your list. The process is similar on the web or in Disney+ mobile app. If you&#39;re watching Disney+ on your phone, you can just tap on the three dots in the corner of a show or movie in Continue Watching and then tap on Remove . On the web, just hover your mouse over anything in Continue Watching and click on the Remove icon in the corner of the movie or show. The only thing you can&#39;t remove from Continue Watching are live events, which will stay until they officially end.&nbsp; Disney says the ability to edit Continue Watching is available today on the web, iOS devices and Apple TV, and will be coming to the other platforms Disney+ is on in the coming weeks.

    "description": "There’s now a native version of Google Drive for Arm-powered PCs, like those featuring last year’s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips . The company announced this feature update in a blog post, saying that the Drive app for Windows is &quot;generally available&quot; for Snapdragon X chipsets. Today’s release follows a beta test going back to last year. This includes machines by several big brands, with the most notable being the newest Microsoft Surface laptops . The Drive port for Arm-based PCs also allows users to access their accounts through the Windows File Explorer app. This should make it easier to pull files from Drive accounts. The native app only works on devices running Windows 11 and Microsoft WebView2. Existing beta users will automatically be updated to the full version. It’s rolling out today but could take up to 15 days to hit everyone’s accounts. The new app is available for all Google Workspace customers, Workspace Individual Subscribers and users with personal Google accounts.

    "title": "Nothing’s Essential Spaces is an AI-powered app done right",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-essential-spaces-ai-powered-app-done-right-163042976.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The most notable feature of Nothing’s latest phones may be its combo of distinct hardware design and Android software tweaks. However, after using the Nothing Phone 3a for a few weeks, the Essential Space app has kept me hooked on what is ostensibly a lower-mid-range smartphone. It’s also a hard app to explain in a single sentence. It’s a little bit of a screenshot gallery, a little bit of a notes app, a little bit of a to-do list app, a little bit of country, a little bit of rock-and-roll. It’s all sewn together with similar AI features to what we&#39;ve seen on most new smartphones. However, compared to the disjointed apps and features of Google AI, Galaxy AI, or Apple Intelligence, Essential Space keeps everything in one place. The utility is helped by having a dedicated launcher button (the Essential Key): A single press will screenshot your phone (and file it in Space), while a long press starts recording your voice — and files it away in Space, too, initiating AI-powered transcription. A double press of the Essential Key launches the app, which seems odd. The screenshot should also be a double press, but maybe that’s just me. It’s not an entirely new premise. We raved about Google’s Pixel Screenshot app , which also does a good job of organizing your screenshots to make things easier to find. However, Google’s Screenshots app is limited to only that — screenshots. Nothing, on the other hand, already announced it’ll bring a similar-seeming Smart Collections feature to the Space app in the future. Inside Nothing’s Space app, the phone extracts dates, attempts to create to-do lists, analyzes screenshots and associates them with time, date, and location data. In short, it makes it easier to remember why I took a screenshot when I did, and it even attempts to create actionable items and reminders. I’ve started taking voice notes and mulling over everything I must do on a workday morning. It&#39;ll summarize it into a to-do list with goals I can check off when completed. With Essential Space, Nothing doesn’t seem to be meddling with AI for the sake of it. While image generation, rewriting emails, and writing guidance on my smartphone are occasionally fun, Essential Space removes many roadblocks to using these functions. I don’t have to ask the Phone 3a to transcribe your voice recordings; it just gets to work. There are limitations, perhaps predictably, given the middleweight processor of a mid-range phone, and AI processing happens on the cloud. Nothing says it deletes processing requests from its servers after they’re completed. However, phones that cost over twice as much as the Phone 3a can handle AI processing on-device for most things that Essential Space can do. There is also no way to share something with Space, whether a photo or a recording unless you initiate the recording through that pesky Essential Key. Of course, you can take screenshots of old screenshots, photos, and websites, but then you’re back to the same disjointed process as other Android devices and iPhones. Nothing’s Essential Space manages to streamline AI into many of the features I use most, like transcription and reminders. The company has teased further functionality, like a focused search for use inside the Space app, and cutesy gimmicks like flip-to-record for your voice notes, which should only bolster what I thought would be weird software curio. It isn’t earth-shattering, but put all together, it&#39;s one of the best integrations of AI aimed at making your life easier.

    "description": "No, pigs aren’t flying, hell hasn’t frozen over and you (probably) haven’t won the Powerball jackpot, but something else nearly as unexpected is happening. Over four years after it debuted AirPods Max , Apple is set to update them with long-overdue features. The company is bringing lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio to the overear headphones when it rolls out iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia 15.4 in April . This is the only major update Apple has given the AirPods Max so far, outside of starting to offer a model with a USB-C charging port back in September . And that&#39;s the kicker: the update will only be for the USB-C version of the AirPods Max, not the original version with the Lightning port. This is due to technical constraints on the Lightning model, such as digital-to-analog converter performance. What&#39;s more, lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio won&#39;t be available in wireless mode. To take advantage of these features, you&#39;ll need to connect the headphones to an audio source via a USB-C cable. As luck would have it, Apple is starting to sell a USB-C to 3.5mm cable today. That will run you $39. There will also be the option to connect your iOS or iPadOS device to speakers or car stereos that have 3.5mm audio ports with the cable. Still, you&#39;ll at last be able to listen to 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio with AirPods Max, as long as you have the USB-C model. Lossless audio will also be compatible with Personalized Spatial Audio, Apple says. Apple Music subscribers can listen to more than 100 million songs in lossless audio. The company notes that, following the firmware update, &quot;AirPods Max will become the only headphones that enable musicians to both create and mix in Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking.&quot; It adds that the ultra-low latency audio feature will allow for no response delay on par with the speakers built into Mac, iPad and iPhone devices. It suggests this feature could be a boon for gamers and livestreamers. Update March 24, 12:08PM ET: Added clarification that lossless and ultra-low latency audio will only be available on the USB-C version of AirPods Max and only in wired mode.

    "description": "The PlayStation 5 release date for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has been revealed. MachineGames&#39; latest Nazi-thwacking simulator will hit Sony&#39;s console on April 17, just four months after it debuted on Xbox and PC. If you pony up for the digital premium edition or physical collector&#39;s bundle, you&#39;ll get early access to the game on April 15 (plus some other goodies). Digital pre-orders are open now and physical pre-orders go live tomorrow, March 25. Microsoft confirmed last August that it would bring a port of the tremendously enjoyable blockbuster to Sony&#39;s console this spring as part of its shift away from platform exclusivity. We&#39;ve seen a number of notable former Xbox exclusives come to PS5 (and Switch in some cases) over the last year or so. Among them are Sea of Thieves , Hi-Fi Rush , Pentiment and Grounded . Forza Horizon 5 is also PS5-bound on April 29 . Meanwhile, Doom: The Dark Ages will hit PS5 on May 15 , the same day it&#39;s set to land on PC and Xbox. Rumors suggest that a remastered collection of the first three Gears of War games is coming to Sony&#39;s system. The rebooted Fable and even Xbox&#39;s flagship Halo series could make the leap over to PlayStation as well, as the walls around Microsoft&#39;s gaming garden continue to crumble.

    "description": "The Amazon Spring Sale has brought a number of discounts to Shark vacuums , both cordless and robotic varieties. On the robot vacuum side of things, you can get the well-regarded Shark AI Ultra robovac for $300, or more than $100 off its regular price. This is a version of one of our top picks for the best robot vacuums . It has strong suction power, an easy-to-use mobile app and an extra-large, self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It’s great for pet hair and all-around cleaning tasks. The only major downside is that this isn’t a hybrid unit, so it doesn’t mop. For that, consider the Shark Matrix Plus. This 2-in-1 robovac vacuums and mops, and it’s currently on sale for $400 . That’s a massive discount of 47 percent, as the typical price is an eyebrow-raising $750. This one also includes a self-emptying base that can accommodate 60 days of dirt and debris. It boasts a true HEPA filter and excels at mopping away deep stains. This is thanks to powerful scrubbers that operate at 100 times per minute. We couldn’t truly recommend this model at its original price, as that’s a whole lot of cheddar, but it’s a steal right now for $400.

    "description": "You have to be patient if you want to take advantage of the best streaming deals because they don&#39;t come around as often as discounts on laptops and smartphones. One of the best deals as of late is a new one from Disney: new and returning subscribers can get four months of the Disney+ Hulu Duo Basic bundle for only $12. You&#39;ll pay $3 per month for four months, and that represents a 72-percent discount off the standard $11-per-month price. For the whole period, you&#39;ll save a total of $32. The deal is available through March 30, but just keep in mind that the Duo Basic plan includes advertisements on both Disney+ and Hulu content. At a time when it feels like every streaming service, audio and video, is pushing their subscription costs ever-higher, it&#39;s a treat to get any amount of entertainment access for a discount. That&#39;s why we&#39;re big fans of the Disney+ Hulu Duo plans; even at the normal rate, it unites two of our favorite standalone content libraries in a single package that&#39;s a solid deal at its normal rates.&nbsp; Snagging the basic tier for an even lower cost feels like a no-brainer, especially if you&#39;re invested in any facet of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, if you&#39;re counting the days until the second season of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives or if you just like to hum along with Encanto in the background while you work.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the ad-free Duo Premium plan isn&#39;t covered in this promotion, nor is the option that also bundles ESPN into the package. Access to Duo Premium will still run you $20 a month, while the Trio bundles begin at $17 a month.

    "link": "https://www.solidot.org/story?sid=80878",
    "description": "AI 技术对电力的狂热需求可以上溯到 2012 年的 AlexNet。当时多伦多大学的 AI 研究员 Alex Krizhevsky、 Ilya Sutskever 和 Geoffrey E. Hinton 正在为图像识别竞赛 ImageNet LSRVC 开发一种卷积神经网络。在当时图像识别是非常有挑战性的。研究人员认为他们需要一个庞大的神经网络，该网络以首席研究员的名字命名为 AlexNet，它有超过 6000 万参数和 65 万个神经元。但一大问题是如此大的神经网络如何进行训练？他们的实验室里有几张英伟达 GTX 580 显卡，每张配备了 3GB 显存，但 AlexNet 太大没办法加载到单张显卡上。研究人员设法将训练阶段划分到两张并行工作的 GPU 上——一半神经元在一张 GPU 上，另一半在另一张上运行。AlexNet 以压倒性优势赢得了 2012 年的比赛，从此 AI 模型的规模不再受限于单张显卡了，而妖精也从瓶子里释放了出来。在 AlexNet 之后，越来越强大的 AI 模型需要成千上万张 GPU。根据 Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)的报告，2010 年到 2020 年间数据中心的功耗相对平稳，原因是英伟达数据中心 GPU 的功耗同期提升了大约 15 倍，因此能保持数据中心功耗的稳定。到了 2022 年基于 transformer 的大模型的出现推动了数据中心功耗的大幅提升。大模型需要处理数百亿甚至数千亿个神经元，训练之后的推理阶段还需要处理大量数据。Open AI 在训练新模型时使用了超过 25,000 张英伟达 Ampere 100 GPU，持续了 100 天，耗电量 50 GW 时，足以满足一个中型城镇一年的电力需求。根据 Google 的数据，训练占 AI 模型生命周期总耗电量的四成，剩下的六成是推理。功耗的飙升促使科学家思考如何在不牺牲性能的情况下减少内存和计算要求。研究人员尝试了模型剪枝、量化等优化方法。",

    "description": "马德里卡洛斯三世大学与亚利桑那州立大学以及萨拉曼卡大学联合开展的一项科学研究表明，家族企业比非家族企业表现出更多的环境责任行为，更具可持续性。在这项研究中，家族企业被定义为创始人或其亲属、后代拥有至少 25% 投票权的企业。研究发现，当家族企业成员加入董事会并参与公司管理时，家族企业推行减少温室气体排放的绿色政策的意愿会更加强烈。该项研究基于来自22个欧洲国家的数据（研究结果可推广至整个欧洲），并表明采取此类旨在促进环境可持续性做法的家族企业也取得了优异的财务业绩。“这可能令人惊讶，但我们的研究表明，减少污染不仅不会给社会带来成本，也不会给企业带来‘经济代价’，实际上还可以提升与企业社会责任相关的行动所带来的社会和经济效益。”",

    "description": "标准宇宙模型「ΛCDM（Lambda-Cold Dark Matter，宇宙常数–冷暗物质模型）」是现代宇宙学的主流理论架构，成功解释了宇宙中大尺度结构的形成与演化。根据该模型，宇宙中仅有约 5% 的物质为的普通物质，其余则由暗物质（约25%）与暗能量（约70%）构成。暗能量被视为驱动宇宙加速膨胀的来源，并假设其能量密度随时间保持不变，也就是所谓的「宇宙常数（Λ）」。然而两项最新的大型国际合作计划，暗能量光谱仪（DESI）与暗能量调查（DES），其研究开始挑战这项假设，指出暗能量可能会随时间演化，进而动摇我们对宇宙膨胀的基本认识。根据 DESI 本身的资料分析，初步结果与标准宇宙模型 ΛCDM 基本一致。然而，当研究团队将这些观测结果进一步与宇宙微波背景辐射、超新星与弱重力透镜等其他观测资料结合时，发现暗能量的影响力可能随时间减弱，显示宇宙学常数可能并非真正的「常数」。目前的统计偏离程度为 2.8 至 4.2 个标准差，虽尚未达到物理学界公认的 5 个标准差门槛，但足以引起学术界的高度关注与讨论。",

    "description": "Moxie Marlinspike, aka Matthew Rosenfeld, is the founder and former CEO of Signal. Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch Signal&#39;s founder, Moxie Marlinspike, poked fun at the military group-chat leak in a post on X. He used the incident as an opportunity to ironically promote the platform. US officials, however, have expressed alarm over the security breach. A major security leak involving the secure messaging platform Signal sparked widespread alarm throughout the country &mdash; but the platform&#39;s founder didn&#39;t appear very concerned. In a post on X on Monday afternoon, Moxie Marlinspike, whose real name is Matthew Rosenfeld, poked fun at the group message leak and used it to ironically promote the &#34;many great reasons to be on Signal.&#34; &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations,&#34; the founder of the platform and its former CEO wrote in the post. There are so many great reasons to be on Signal. Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations. Don’t sleep on this opportunity… &mdash; Moxie Marlinspike (@moxie) March 24, 2025 Marlinspike was referring to Monday&#39;s news that The Atlantic&#39;s editor in chief was accidentally added to a Signal group chat called &#34;Houthi PC small group.&#34; &#34;PC&#34; referred to the principal committee, and the chat was primarily made up of senior US officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence&nbsp; Tulsi Gabbard , and Secretary of State&nbsp; Marco Rubio . The chat&#39;s participants were discussing forthcoming strikes on Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels , Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic&#39;s editor in chief, revealed in an article. Marlinspike&#39;s reaction is in sharp contrast to that of that of Democratic and Republican officials, many of whom expressed alarm at the security leak. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters the incident &#34;sounds like a huge screwup&#34; and that &#34;somebody dropped the ball.&#34; Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho said Tuesday there will be an investigation into the incident, The Hill reported . Marlinspike wasn&#39;t the only social media user to poke fun at the snafu. However, comments on his post were mixed, with some blaming the officials who made the mistake and others saying that the platform should improve its security. On Tuesday, Signal wrote in an X post that there has been &#34;misinfo flying around that might drive people away from Signal and private communications.&#34; Signal cited a Tuesday report from NPR in its post. In its report, NPR said it obtained a Pentagon email from March 18, warning employees about a potential Signal vulnerability. &#34;The memo used the term &#39;vulnerability&#39; in relation to Signal&mdash;but it had nothing to do with Signal&#39;s core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users,&#34; Signal wrote on X. Right now there are a lot of new eyes on Signal, and not all of them are familiar with secure messaging and its nuances. Which means there’s misinfo flying around that might drive people away from Signal and private communications. One piece of misinfo we need to address is the… &mdash; Signal (@signalapp) March 25, 2025 &#34;Phishing isn&#39;t new, and it&#39;s not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal&#39;s underlying technology. Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites,&#34; the company continued. Signal is a nonprofit, open-sourced, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform that has emerged as one of the most popular messaging apps over the last few years. Only recipients can see messages, so it&#39;s commonly used by journalists, government officials, and tech giants. Signal and Marlinspike did not respond to requests for comment from BI.

    "description": "ChatGPT has a new image generator feature that can create images from users&#39; text prompts. Jaque Silva/NurPhoto ChatGPT released an image generator on Tuesday. A software engineer on X said they discovered that the feature had trouble creating images of &#34;sexy women.&#34; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it was a &#34;bug&#34; that will be fixed. ChatGPT&#39;s new image generator appeared to have a bug that only allowed the AI tool to create images of &#34;sexy men.&#34; An X user who identified themself as a software engineer pointed out the issue on Tuesday, shortly after the feature was unveiled. The image generator is a new function of ChatGPT that allows users to create elaborate images from detailed prompts. &#34;New ChatGPT image gen can draw sexy men but not sexy women,&#34; the user wrote, posting a screenshot of ChatGPT&#39;s response, which said, &#34;The difference comes down to context and how content is interpreted in terms of sexualization and objectification, especially when it involves women.&#34; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded that image generation of sexy women &#34;should be allowed&#34; and that it was a &#34;bug&#34; that will be fixed. &#34;Hot guy though!&#34; Altman added. ChatGPT appeared to have no issues generating an image of a &#34;hot woman&#34; when prompted by Business Insider. ChatGPT can now create images of humans through detailed prompts. Screenshot of ChatGPT The image generator does have restrictions around creating images of real people . When Business Insider continued the prompt requesting an image of Sam Altman, ChatGPT responded that it couldn&#39;t generate an exact image of the CEO but could instead create a &#34;character inspired by his features with a unique, artistic twist.&#34; ChatGPT&#39;s new image generator has content restrictions regarding generating images of real people. Screenshot of ChatGPT OpenAI said in its announcement of the feature that there are &#34;heightened restrictions&#34; on requests for images of real people, especially when they involve nudity or graphic violence. In an addendum explaining the new feature, the company said it won&#39;t outright block the capability of generating images of adult public figures. This allows for the &#34;possibility of helpful and beneficial uses in areas like educational, historical, satirical and political speech,&#34; OpenAI said. Public figures can, however, opt their image out of this feature, the company said. An OpenAI spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-war-big-law-targets-jenner-block-firm-resists-2025-3",
    "description": "Donald Trump on Tuesday signed his latest executive order targeting a Big Law firm, this time taking aim at Jenner &amp; Block. Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images Donald Trump on Tuesday signed his latest executive order targeting a Big Law firm, Jenner &amp; Block. The order is similar to one against Perkins Coie, which a federal judge blocked as unconstitutional. Jenner &amp; Block, in a statement, said the firm remains focused on serving its clients despite the order. Jenner &amp; Block on Tuesday became the latest target in President Donald Trump&#39;s war on Big Law after he issued an executive order revoking its attorneys&#39; security clearances and ordering a review of the firm&#39;s government contracts. But Jenner signaled it doesn&#39;t plan to back down without a fight. The firm, headquartered in Chicago, employs over 400 attorneys across six offices nationwide and is the fourth major law firm targeted by the Trump administration with similar executive actions. Each of the firms &mdash;&nbsp; Paul Weiss , Perkins Coie, and Covington &amp; Burling &mdash; has had ties to Trump&#39;s political opponents. In the Tuesday order, Trump specifically singled out attorney Andrew Weissmann, a Jenner employee who served as a lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller&#39;s Special Counsel&#39;s Office, which investigated Trump&#39;s ties to Russia in 2016. The order described Weissmann&#39;s career as &#34;rooted in weaponized government and abuse of power.&#34; &#34;Jenner &amp; Block has had a long history representing clients, paid and pro bono, in their most difficult matters since 1914,&#34; Jenner &amp; Block said in a statement released after the order was issued. &#34;Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court. We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients&#39; interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.&#34; US District Judge Beryl Howell on March 12 partially blocked Trump&#39;s order against Perkins Coie. Politico reported that during an emergency hearing, the judge said that the &#34;retaliatory animus&#34; of Trump&#39;s order against the firm was &#34;clear on its face&#34; and &#34;runs head-on into the wall of First Amendment protections.&#34; On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion to disqualify Howell from overseeing the lawsuit, arguing the judge is &#34;insufficiently impartial&#34; to rule on the case. While Perkins Coie fights the executive order in court, another targeted firm has taken a contrasting approach to handling Trump&#39;s actions against it. Instead of challenging the order&#39;s legality, Paul Weiss agreed to reevaluate its hiring practices in alignment with Trump&#39;s anti-DEI initiatives and provide $40 million in pro bono legal work to further causes identified by the Trump administration, such as combating antisemitism and assisting veterans. Trump rescinded the order against Paul Weiss after the agreement was struck, though Business Insider previously reported the language in Paul Weiss&#39; copy of the agreement did not include references to DEI that were in Trump&#39;s announcement. Rachel Cohen , a now-former associate from the high-profile firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP, last Friday publicly resigned over what she said was her firm&#39;s resistance to challenging the president&#39;s orders. Also on Friday, the president sent a&nbsp; memo to Attorney General Pam Bondi &nbsp;ordering her to identify &#34;frivolous&#34; lawsuits against his administration and flag the law firms associated with the cases so they can be targeted for punitive actions like those levied against Paul Weiss and Perkins Coie. In an email to his staff on Sunday, Paul Weiss Chairman Brad Karp called Trump&#39;s order &#34;unprecedented&#34; in the firm&#39;s 150-year history and an &#34;existential threat.&#34; &#34;The executive order could easily have destroyed our firm,&#34; Karp wrote. &#34;It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients.&#34; The assault on Big Law &mdash;&nbsp;and each firm&#39;s disparate handling of the orders against them &mdash;&nbsp;has made waves across the legal industry, with legal scholars warning Business Insider the unprecedented attacks from the sitting president are a threat to the rule of law that have implications far beyond damaging the businesses of the targeted firms. &#34;Something like this has never happened, or maybe hasn&#39;t happened since the time of Andrew Jackson. I mean, this is really a kind of a constitutional crisis,&#34; Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, previously told BI. &#34;I think our legal system is under attack, and it&#39;s a question of who&#39;s going to step up and defend it.&#34; Have a tip?

    "description": "An artist rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter, the F-47. US Air Force Boeing won the $20 billion contract to develop the Air Force&#39;s sixth-gen stealth fighter, the F-47 . The designation is a nod to the P-47 fighter, the USAF&#39;s founding year, and the 47th president. See the competing NGAD fighter designs proposed by Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. Boeing will develop the US Air Force&#39;s highly anticipated sixth-generation stealth fighter, poised to replace the F-22 Raptor and play a leading role in the Air Force&#39;s future fleet. The sixth-generation combat aircraft is a central component of the Air Force&#39;s secretive and costly Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) , which seeks to fly the future fighter, designated the F-47, alongside autonomous drone wingmen known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). Though never officially confirmed, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman competed for the $20 billion contract. Northrop Grumman dropped out of the running in 2023, leaving Boeing to battle it out with Lockheed Martin&#39;s dominance of the stealth fighter force. Boeing&#39;s successful bid An artist rendering shows an early version of Boeing&#39;s proposed design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation stealth fighter. Boeing President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing was selected to develop the future combat aircraft, which will be designated the F-47. The designation is a deviation from typical naming conventions because it was previously used for the World War II-era fighter, the P-47. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said the designation is a nod to the P-47 escort fighter of World War II, as well as the Air Force&#39;s founding year in 1947 and the &#34;pivotal&#34; support of the 47th US President Donald Trump in developing the aircraft. Winning the $20 billion NGAD contract will serve as a much-needed boost not only to its waning defense unit but also to recoup losses from the KC-46 tanker and new Air Force One aircraft . Steve Parker, interim president, and chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said the company made &#34;the most significant investment in the history of our defense business&#34; after being tasked with designing, building, and delivering the sixth-generation fighter to the Air Force. &#34;We are ready to provide the most advanced and innovative NGAD aircraft needed to support the mission,&#34; Parker said in a statement. The US Air Force&#39;s next-gen stealth plane An early concept art rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter. US Air Force The pursuit for America&#39;s next-generation platforms began over a decade ago in the early 2010s. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched a study in 2014 to explore strategies to maintain the US&#39; edge in air superiority. It found that simply developing sixth-generation combat aircraft wouldn&#39;t be enough to ensure air superiority against US adversaries, instead urging a &#34;family of systems&#34; across multiple domains, including air, space, and cyberspace. Air superiority is the condition where a nation&#39;s aircraft can fly at minimal risk from other aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. The US&#39;s longtime edge in achieving this is increasingly threatened by the proliferation of air defense missiles and China&#39;s aircraft build-up , including two types of stealth fighters. Building upon DARPA&#39;s findings, the Air Force launched its own study, Air Superiority 2030, which laid the groundwork for its NGAD program, which envisioned creating a future hybrid fleet of crewed and uncrewed aerial systems. As one of the Air Force&#39;s most sensitive and highly classified programs, few details were publicly known about the NGAD program. In September 2020, Will Roper, then-Air Force acquisition chief, officially confirmed that the service had test-flown a prototype of its next-gen fighter . This was the first public acknowledgment of the top-secret program that he said he hoped would garner &#34;greater credibility&#34; on the program&#39;s progress. By 2023, Boeing, Lockheed Martin , and Northrop Grumman appeared to be in the running to develop the NGAD platform, floating potential designs for it in promotional materials for their future projects &mdash; a common practice among US military aircraft manufacturers. Northrop Grumman &mdash; the lead contractor for the B-2 Spirit and B-21 Raider stealth bombers &mdash; was also in the running to build the NGAD aircraft but dropped out of consideration as the prime developer in 2023, instead intending to support other bids as a supplier. Early concept designs A video promoting Boeing Phantom Works&#39; upcoming projects appears to show a concept rendering of the next-generation platform. Boeing Defense/X Art renderings of the NGAD fighter show little more than the jet&#39;s sleek exterior and wings, revealing few details about the aircraft&#39;s final design. But concept designs released by the three competing legacy combat aircraft contractors could give an idea of what the F-47 could look like when it takes to the skies. In a promotional video released by Boeing Phantom Works in 2023, a brief rendering of a 3D model stealth plane showed assembling mid-flight to showcase the digital design capabilities to streamline the development of innovative aircraft. The hypothetical stealth aircraft appears to feature a flat, tailless cranked wing design with two engines. A fighter jet upset An art rendering shows Lockheed Martin&#39;s proposed design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation stealth fighter. Lockheed Martin Before Boeing was selected to build the F-47, Lockheed Martin had a monopoly on the Air Force&#39;s combat aircraft production , leading some to believe that it would be the prime contractor of the NGAD platform. Following the fighter jet upset, Boeing&#39;s share price jumped 3% to $5.28 a share on Friday, adding $4 billion in market value. Meanwhile, Lockheed&#39;s stock dropped about 5.4% to $27.04 a share, an estimated $6 billion loss in market value. &#34;While disappointed with this outcome, we are confident we delivered a competitive solution,&#34; Lockheed Martin said in a statement. Boeing has long been a major player in the military aerospace sector, including developing the F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets and the KC-46 aerial tanker . However, unlike competitors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which secured domestic contracts for the F-22 Raptor and B-2 Spirit stealth aircraft respectively, Boeing&#39;s long-term defense production largely relies on foreign acquisition and international defense sales. Boeing and Lockheed previously faced off to develop the fifth-generation multirole fighter as part of the Pentagon&#39;s Joint Strike Fighter program. Lockheed&#39;s X-35 beat out Boeing&#39;s X-32, entering production as the F-35 Lightning II . Lockheed&#39;s NGAD design Lockheed Martin posted an aircraft outline that appeared to resemble an NGAD-like platform on its Instagram story. Lockheed Martin/Instagram Lockheed&#39;s hint at its potential NGAD concept proposal was a lot more subtle. In 2023, Lockheed&#39;s Skunk Works division posted a black-and-white aircraft outline on its Instagram to celebrate its 80th anniversary. Despite the lack of details in the cryptic post, the planform appears to resemble a tactical aircraft design, likely related to the Air Force&#39;s NGAD program. Lockheed further pointed to its potential future participation in the NGAD by releasing another promotional video later that year, seemingly referring to the Air Force&#39;s pursuit of a hybrid fleet. The video features crewed and uncrewed systems flying in formation, with Lockheed&#39;s F-35 surrounded by futuristic UAVs. Northrop Grumman withdraws NGAD bid A 2021 video released by Northrop Grumman featured concept renderings of its future aircraft projects, including what appears to be a next-generation fighter jet. Northrop Grumman/YouTube Northrop Grumman was also competing to be the prime contractor behind the Air Force&#39;s NGAD aircraft. The company hinted at its interest in participating in the NGAD program in a 2021 promotional video that appeared to include a tailless stealth fighter in a hangar with historic and futuristic aircraft. But Northrop Grumman&#39;s bid to build the NGAD fighter was cut short after it pulled out of consideration in 2023, CEO Kathy Warden announced. Warden added that the company was &#34;responding to other bidders&#39; request for proposal as the supplier, that&#39;s particularly in our mission system portfolio.&#34; Navy&#39;s next-gen fighter up for grabs An artist rendering shows an early version of Northrop Grumman&#39;s design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter. Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman was selected to build the B-21 Raider, the Air Force&#39;s first sixth-generation stealth bomber, as part of the service&#39;s Long Range Strike Bomber program. The company unveiled the stealth bomber in late 2022, and the aircraft took its maiden flight in November 2023. Northrop Grumman is still in the running against Boeing to develop the Navy&#39;s next-generation fighter, the F/A-XX, which aims to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Steep ambitions, steep price tag An artist rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter, the F-47. US Air Force The NGAD&#39;s steep ambitions to revolutionize the US&nbsp; air superiority mission &nbsp;come with an equally steep price tag. In 2018, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the NGAD airframe alone could cost up to $300 million each. Then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in 2023 that he anticipated the unit cost to be &#34;too expensive to be purchased in large numbers,&#34; revealing the service&#39;s plan to team each NGAD with two CCAs. From 2022 to 2024, Congress allocated $5.1 billion to develop NGAD-related technologies, which included a &#34;strategic pause&#34; in the program due to high project costs. In 2025, the Biden administration requested $2.75 billion to build an NGAD platform, which could skyrocket to an estimated $5.72 billion by 2029. &#39;China is a threat today&#39; An F-22 flies over Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. US Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Paige Weldon Kendall emphasized the pressing need for the NGAD &#34; family of systems &#34; amid evolving threats by US adversaries, especially after the Pentagon truncated the procurement of F-22 jets from 750 to 187 in 2009. &#34;NGAD will include attributes such as enhanced lethality and the ability to survive, persist, interoperate, and adapt in the air domain, all within highly contested operational environments,&#34; Kendall said in May 2023. &#34;No one does this better than the US Air Force , but we will lose that edge if we don&#39;t move forward now.&#34; The urgency is also spurred in part by China&#39;s increasingly sophisticated long-range air defense and electronic warfare systems as China-Taiwan tensions contribute to growing militarization in the Indo-Pacific. The F-47 is expected to operate closely with two new uncrewed fighters , so-called &#34;loyal wingmen&#34; that are capable of flying missions too dangerous for a pilot in the cockpit. In a potential war scenario with China , defense analysts argued the F-22&#39;s limited range and payload capacity would be ill-suited for the terrain, consisting of islands spread hundreds of miles apart, leaving the fleet vulnerable to attack during refueling efforts. &#34;China is not a future threat; China is a threat today,&#34; Kendall said during a 2024 keynote address. &#34;I am not saying war in the Pacific is imminent or inevitable. It is not,&#34; he added. &#34;But I am saying that the likelihood is increasing and will continue to do so.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was one of the top officials who used the Signal app to discuss airstrikes in an apparent breach of security protocol. ALEX WROBLEWSKI/AFP via Getty Images Military social media is buzzing with memes about officials&#39; use (or misuse) of Signal . Trump officials mistakenly added a journalist to a Signal chat on military operations. The Pentagon recently warned against using Signal due to hacking concerns. Is the cure to male loneliness… starting a group text to bomb the Houthis ? That&#39;s one of the sarcastic questions posed in memes blowing up across military-focused social media after top Trump officials used Signal to discuss airstrikes against Yemen&#39;s Houthi militants &mdash; an operational security violation, or OPSEC, almost certain to be career-ending or worse for a rank-and-file soldier. Vice President JD Vance , Trump&#39;s national security advisor Mike Waltz, and other top officials debated whether to strike Yemen in a group chat that mistakenly included Jeffery Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, who reported on the chaotic exchange. Goldberg reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared an attack plan, including the names of those being targeted, before the airstrikes on the encrypted app &mdash; raising concerns this practice could spoil the operation or endanger troops. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kyle Eberly (@sitreps2steercos) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that &#34;there was no classified information as I understand it,&#34; and Waltz added, &#34;We have our legal teams looking at it.&#34; Signal has been widely used for years throughout lower military levels for communication. But even junior troops with access to top-secret materials, which could include pending missile strikes, have long known that communicating such sensitive details should only be done via government-provided secure lines, like SIPR (secure internet protocol router) email or phone, making the message exchange an intelligence gaffe of preposterous proportions. The founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, mocked the spillage . &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations,&#34; he wrote in a post on X Monday. Likely because of Signal&#39;s popularity, the Pentagon released new guidance last week discouraging the app&#39;s use even for everyday communications, NPR reported Tuesday . According to the memo NPR cites, &#34;Russian professional hacking groups are employing the &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations,&#34; the guidance read. &#34;The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information.&#34; The memo was dated March 18, one week after the baffling Houthi chat began. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kyle Eberly (@sitreps2steercos) Memes circulating online poke fun at Hegseth, Vance, Waltz, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard , all military veterans who presumably had to undergo annual cyber awareness while serving. Many memes and users pondered whether the entire military would be required to brush up on OPSEC (operational security) classes and ask if the adage &#34;different spanks for different ranks,&#34; will continue to hold true. Former CIA operations officer John Sipher called the move &#34;worse tha[n] amateur&#34; in a post on BlueSky. &#34;It 100% provides Moscow information on US capabilities and personalities. Information they can use down the line or share with Iran &mdash; the Houthi enablers. It may provide ongoing access to some participants.&#34; Okay this one is my favorite Signal gate meme [image or embed] &mdash; ex-Lethality Jane ( @lethalityjane.bsky.social ) March 25, 2025 at 2:04 PM &#34;Member when all we had to worry about was some S2 dork bringing his cellphone into the scif?&#34; asked one commenter, referring to personnel in ultra-secure areas known as sensitive compartmented information facilities. &#34;Pepperidge farms remembers.&#34; &#34;Text STOP to unsubscribe from war plan updates,&#34; read another. &#34;Somewhere a US Army counterintelligence agent is having a minor breakdown over how he has a perfect new case study for his annual OPSEC brief but he won&#39;t be able to use it for at least four years,&#34; read yet another BlueSky post.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-ecommerce-brands-record-safety-warnings-us-consumer-watchdog-2025-3",
    "description": "Two-thirds of the products that received consumer safety warnings in 2024 came to the US from Chinese companies, according to the Public Interest Research Group. Associated Press US consumer safety watchdogs are issuing a rapidly growing number of product warnings. Warnings are issued when companies don&#39;t voluntarily comply with recalls for products deemed hazardous. A US official told the Public Interest Research Group the surge boils down to one word: China. The explosion of international e-commerce brands is leading to a sharp rise in product safety warnings. Warnings issued by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission reached a record high of 63 last year, according to a new analysis from the Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission issues warnings when companies don&#39;t voluntarily comply with recalls for hazardous it deems hazardous. Last year&#39;s figure is up dramatically from 38 in 2023 and 12 in 2022, according to the PIRG analysis. There were fewer than 10 warnings combined from 2015 to 2021, it added. So, what&#39;s contributing to the rise? &#34;In a word, China,&#34; acting CPSC&#39;s chairman, Peter Feldman, told PIRG. Two-thirds of the products that received warnings in 2024 came to the US from Chinese companies, the PIRG report found. &#34;The United States is facing a flood of Chinese consumer products that violate US safety laws,&#34; Feldman said. &#34;When CPSC identifies illegal Chinese goods, the manufacturer is, more often than not, unreachable, unfindable, or uncooperative.&#34; In other words, a warning is an indication that safety officials are not able to make progress with a company concerning a recall. Some of the hazardous products included a foldable step stool that could collapse or tip over, a line of e-bike batteries prone to overheating or catching fire, infant loungers that posed a risk of suffocation or entrapment, and bike helmets that didn&#39;t meet US safety standards. Many of the products that received warnings were sold by third parties on Amazon&#39;s and Walmart&#39;s marketplaces. In at least one instance each, both retailers agreed to contact customers about affected products. An Amazon spokesperson told BI that all products offered on its site are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The company also notifies customers of product updates through a dedicated page in page in their Amazon accounts called &#34;Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts.&#34; The PIRG analysis also found two items with warnings that were sold on Shein&#39;s website. Among the recalled products, the report found that those sold exclusively online were twice as likely to violate a US safety standard than those sold in physical stores. Interestingly, while eight products were recalled that were exclusively sold on Temu, the PIRG report also noted that no Temu items received warnings last year because all companies involved cooperated with the recall procedure.

    "description": "Ben Affleck at the world premiere of &#34;The Accountant 2&#34; at SXSW. Marcus Ingram / Getty Images Ben Affleck told GQ that he made his Hollywood career a 9-to-5 job to spend more time with his children. &#34;I was really missing time I could never get back,&#34; he said. Affleck shares three children with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner. Ben Affleck said he adapted his filmmaking career into a 9-to-5 job so that he could spend more time with his three teenage children. In a new GQ interview , Affleck said he realized that being present as a parent was important to him, so he wanted to avoid spending multiple days on sets away from his children. &#34;I was really missing time I could never get back. My kids were 8, 11, and 14, and I felt like: I don&#39;t want to miss any of this time at all,&#34; Affleck said. &#34;And so I thought, well, Let me figure out a way to work at home and have the kind of job where I can actually be here and build my schedule around that.&#34; Affleck co-parents three children with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner : Violet Anne Affleck, 19, Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck, 16, and Samuel Affleck, 13. Affleck told GQ he developed a better work-life balance while working at Artists Equity, a production company he co-founded with his longtime friend and collaborator Matt Damon and investing partner Gerry Cardinale. Since the company&#39;s founding in 2022, they have produced the critically acclaimed sports movie &#34; Air &#34; and the upcoming action sequel, &#34;The Accountant 2,&#34; among others. &#34;Part of what&#39;s great about this Artists Equity job, part of why I love it, is because I&#39;m in LA,&#34; Affleck said. &#34;When we&#39;re done at 2:30, I&#39;m going to go, and I&#39;ll be home at 3:45 when my kids get off the bus. And I&#39;m able to construct a life that does that. And that means more to me than any of it. That makes me happier.&#34; Matt Damon and Ben Affleck at SXSW festival to promote Artists Equity&#39;s latest film, &#34;The Accountant 2.&#34; Michael Buckner/SXSW Conference &amp; Festivals via Getty Images Affleck also told GQ that he now avoids directing more films because they can be time-consuming. &#34;The one regret I have about all the movies that I&#39;ve directed is the amount of time it&#39;s taken me away from my kids,&#34; he said. &#34;I love making art. I loved making &#39;The Town . &#39; But I was away from my kids for long periods of time. There&#39;s little chunks that I missed, and that doesn&#39;t feel good.&#34; Other celebrities, such as Kieran Culkin and Eva Mendes , have also opened up about how they balance their careers with raising children. Mendes told the &#34; Today &#34; show in 2024 that she took a hiatus from acting to pursue other projects, like writing a children&#39;s book and raising her two children with Ryan Gosling . &#34;I still work. I just didn&#39;t act because acting takes you on locations. It takes you away,&#34; Mendes said. Meanwhile, Culkin, who won his first Oscar earlier this month, told the Guardian in 2024 that he has a rule to not spend more than 8 days on set away from his children.

    "title": "Trump wants DOGE to look at voter rolls",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-doge-voter-rolls-executive-order-2025-3",
    "description": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly made false claims about elections. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images President Donald Trump wants DOGE to look at voter rolls. According to an executive order, the DOGE office would help review public voter information. No federal official has the power to remove a person from state rolls. President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered the DOGE office to assist in reviewing publicly available voter rolls. In a lengthy executive order, Trump asked the Department of Homeland Security to work with DOGE administrator Amy Gleason &#34;to review each State&#39;s publicly available voter registration list and available records concerning voter list maintenance activities.&#34; It&#39;s unclear the extent to which DOGE would use the data. No federal official has the power to remove someone from the voter rolls. &#34;DOGE certainly has no power to kick people off rolls,&#34; Rick Hasen, an election law expert and a law professor at UCLA, told Business Insider. &#34;But they could make a lot of noise trying to claim they&#39;ve found fraud when they find that voter registration rolls are not being kept up to date.&#34; The White House has repeatedly said Gleason leads the DOGE office. She recently declared in court that Elon Musk does not work for the rebranded US DOGE Service. But Musk is the de facto leader of DOGE, a point underscored by his appearance on Fox News Tuesday night with members of the DOGE team. Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the DOGE office&#39;s efforts to obtain sensitive and nonpublic federal data. Unlike social security data, many states make their voter lists publicly available, often for a fee. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group that monitors state-level legislation, some states restrict access to their information. Trump has repeatedly falsely claimed that he won the 2020 election. After his 2016 victory, he repeatedly claimed without evidence that fraud prevented him from winning the popular vote. In the lead-up to the 2024 race, Republicans raised concerns about non-citizens voting in the presidential race, an occurrence that remains rare and illegal. Recent audits of voter rolls have found extremely few numbers of noncitizens registered to vote. Georgia found 20 noncitizens registered to vote out of more than 8 million registered voters in the state. During the first Trump administration, 44 states opposed a Trump election commission&#39;s sweeping request for voter information, according to a 2017 CNN report. At the time, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, vice chair of the commission, had said the data would eventually be made public. Hasen told Business Insider said Tuesday&#39;s EO could spark such a confrontation again. &#34;We will see what happens this time,&#34; he said. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "What is Signal? How the popular encrypted messaging app keeps your texts private",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-signal-app",
    "description": "Signal is an encrypted messaging app. Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Signal is a messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption to keep your messages private. When you send a message on Signal, the only people who can see it are the recipients. You can use the Signal app to send texts, photos, videos, and voice messages. Over the last few years, Signal has become one of the most popular messaging apps. Favored by tech giants, cybersecurity experts, journalists, government officials, and many more, Signal has gone from a darling secret of the security community to a group chatting phenomenon. It&#39;s recently been thrust into the spotlight after the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat where top Trump administration officials discussed bombing Yemen. According to Goldberg, Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard , and Secretary of State Marco Rubio all appeared to be members of the group chat, which was called &#34;Houthi PC small group,&#34; referring to the principals committee. Signal founder and former CEO Matthew Rosenfeld, who goes by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike, poked fun at the botched chat in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. &#34;There are so many great reasons to be on Signal,&#34; he wrote. &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations.&#34; Elon Musk has also endorsed Signal before, writing simply in a post on X in 2021, &#34;Use Signal.&#34; He changed his mind about the app a few years later, though, writing in May 2024 that it had &#34;known vulnerabilities.&#34; Signal&#39;s president, Meredith Whittaker , later told Wired she went two nights without sleeping &#34;just dealing with Twitter stuff.&#34; &#34;He&#39;s been a fan. So I don&#39;t know what changed,&#34; she said. &#34;What I do know is that, as far as we know, the claim was completely baseless.&#34; Whittaker added there was no &#34;serious report&#34; backing up Musk&#39;s claims. Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up in 2018 by the app&#39;s cofounders, Rosenfeld and Brian Acton, who also cofounded WhatsApp . The foundation has five board members and serves to &#34;support Signal&#39;s growth and ongoing operations as well as investigate the future of private communication,&#34; according to its website . Here&#39;s a guide to the Signal app, including why it&#39;s become so popular. The Signal app, explained Signal is safer and more secure than most messengers because of a process called &#34; end-to-end encryption .&#34; This works by encoding a sender&#39;s message in such a way that only the intended receiver can view it. Neither Signal, nor your phone company, nor the government can read your messages. That&#39;s why it has remained popular. Signal lets you chat securely. Signal However, Signal&#39;s messages are only secure if both the sender and receiver are using the app. If you prefer to communicate through Signal, the app has a simple feature to invite someone to download it. It&#39;s also just as easy to block someone on Signal from contacting you. Encryption itself isn&#39;t a unique feature, as apps like iMessage, Telegram, and WeChat also offer it. But one of Signal&#39;s selling points is that its source code is also publicly available, so experts have been able to poke and prod at its defenses for years, strengthening it in the process. Signal&#39;s key features Signal is similar to other messaging apps but with more robust security features. It&#39;s available for free on iPhone, Android, Mac, and PC. Android users can even set their default messaging app to Signal if they want to. There&#39;s a Signal app on nearly every major system. Signal.org On a basic level, you can have one-on-one conversations with someone or start a group chat on Signal . In these chats, you can send pictures, videos, internet links, voice messages, and more. Signal&#39;s beta version has tested new kinds of chats with forum-like features, including group admins, updates, and timers for disappearing messages. For now, groups are capped at 1,000 people, but adding and removing people from a Signal group is simple. If you&#39;re concerned about someone accessing the app from your phone, you can lock the Signal app with the same passcode or fingerprint scan normally used to lock your phone. Signal requires a phone number to join the app. To keep yours private, you can sign up with a Google Voice number. Apple users will want to visit their privacy settings within the app and turn off &#34;Show Calls in Recents&#34; to prevent their history from syncing with the cloud. You can also set your messages to disappear over time, or set photos to disappear after a single viewing. Barbara Smith and Vivian McCall contributed to an earlier version of this story.

    "title": "Joining the MCU was the best business decision Elizabeth Olsen ever made ",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-olsen-movies-tv-shows-marvel-2025-3",
    "description": "Jake Giles Netter/Max; Magnolia Pictures; Marvel Studios; Chelsea Jia Feng/BI Elizabeth Olsen may be best known for starring in a billion-dollar franchise, but she still holds her indie roots close. Three years after her breakthrough in the 2011 indie film &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene,&#34; a Sundance darling that cost less than $1 million to make, Olsen would make her first in a decade&#39;s worth of appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch . She said taking the role was a smart &mdash; not to mention lucrative &mdash; decision. But while Olsen told Business Insider the storytelling possibilities are &#34;endless&#34; in the MCU, it&#39;s important she diversifies her work outside blockbusters. &#34;Those other choices you make are incredibly important because they say so much about what your passion is,&#34; Olsen said. That led her to her latest role in Fleur Fortuné&#39;s new dystopian sci-fi thriller , &#34;The Assessment.&#34; Olsen and Himesh Patel star as Mia and Aaryan, a couple who agree to undergo an emotionally grueling seven-day assessment to determine if they&#39;re fit to have children. Himesh Patel and Elizabeth Olsen in &#34;The Assessment.&#34; Magnolia Pictures Olsen was intrigued by the dystopian premise of &#34;The Assessment&#34; and the opportunity to work with Fortuné, whom she described as an incredible visual filmmaker. &#34;I loved the game and the rules of the game that these characters had to play together,&#34; Olsen said. &#34;I loved how contained something that took place in a near future time was. And I really love stories that play by their own rules.&#34; As an independent film, &#34;The Assessment&#34; offered a more intimate atmosphere, one that allowed Fortuné, Olsen, Patel, and their costar Alicia Vikander to become t heir own indie version of the Avengers: &#34;I really felt like we were our own little troupe.&#34; For the latest interview in Business Insider&#39;s Role Play series, Olsen reflects on auditioning for police procedurals, the best advice she ever got, and how starring in Marvel projects has bolstered her indie career. On auditioning for anything and everything early in her career Olsen in &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene.&#34; Fox Searchlight Business Insider: You have an affinity for playing characters who are going through a lot emotionally, going as far back as your film debut in &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene.&#34; What draws you to these heavier roles? Elizabeth Olsen: With &#34;Martha,&#34; I mean, I auditioned for everything around that time. I auditioned for &#34;Blue Bloods,&#34; I auditioned for &#34;CSI&#34; whatever it was, I auditioned for &#34;Law &amp; Order.&#34; I auditioned for all of the things and it just happened to be a job that I got. I would have said yes to any job because I just wanted to be a working actor. I just happened to be very lucky that it was a script that I was totally obsessed with and a character that I was really fighting for. I don&#39;t mean to put myself through any kind of extreme experience, but I do think the extremities of what it means to be a person in the world are more interesting to explore. The things that I&#39;m really drawn to right now are: What are prototypes or characters that we&#39;ve seen before, and then how can we subvert them in some way? At least on the job I&#39;m on right now, that&#39;s how I feel. You got to work with Spike Lee on the 2013 &#34;Oldboy&#34; remake. What was it like working with a famed director so early in your career? You could have told me to do anything with him, and I would have done it. I loved getting to work with him. He is also such a kind filmmaker. He&#39;s so kind to his crew. He&#39;s kind to his cast. He has such a boyishness to him and to get to work with him was really such a dream. He has such a canon that it&#39;s amazing that I keep watching movies of his that I hadn&#39;t seen before. I just watched &#34;School Daze&#34; recently, twice, and I am such a fan of his work, and continue to be. I feel lucky that I got to work with him. On being &#39;petrified&#39; on the set of &#39;Avengers: Age of Ultron&#39; and why Marvel characters are like Greek heroes Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch in &#34;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.&#34; Marvel Studios It&#39;s also been 10 years since you played Wanda in &#34; Avengers: Age of Ultron .&#34; With all that time and hindsight, is there anything that you look back on and view differently about that movie or your experience working on it? Oh, I was petrified. I was so scared. I didn&#39;t know how to take up space at all. And I felt good, actually, about that film. I think we established a foundation for her that we kept building off of. It&#39;s really nice to have had 10 years with the character. I have to say, it&#39;s something you don&#39;t always get to have unless you&#39;re doing television. So, if someone asked me to do it again in 50 years, I hope I&#39;m still around to play a very old version of her [ Laughs ]. Hey, if Hugh Jackman can do it, so can you. Yeah! After the events of &#34; Doctor Strange 2 ,&#34; there&#39;s a big question mark surrounding your character. Do you feel like there&#39;s unfinished business, or more to explore after Wanda&#39;s villain arc in that movie? I don&#39;t know if I feel like there&#39;s unfinished business, but I always feel like there&#39;s room to explore. I think the comic books have been going on for so many decades that there is such endless story that you can always go back to. How we make it work for the world that we&#39;ve established, I&#39;m not sure. But I do think you can always keep going back with these characters. They&#39;re like iconic Greek heroes, basically. And there&#39;s always stories to be had with those types of prototypes. On finding success outside the MCU and the role that marked a turning point Olsen playing infamous killer Candy Montgomery in &#34;Love &amp; Death.&#34; Jake Giles Netter/Max The MCU is vast, but all those projects can be time consuming. How have you navigated the balance of playing this character that you care about for so long and also getting to explore other material outside of that, like indie movies and TV series like &#34;Sorry for Your Loss,&#34; &#34;Ingrid Goes West,&#34; and &#34;Wind River&#34;? Well, it&#39;s just scheduling, I guess, at the end of the day. Sometimes things don&#39;t always work out, but I think those types of choices become really important, because if you&#39;re only doing Marvel projects, the way other producers or directors see you, they might make assumptions that you don&#39;t want to work on something super small, or you don&#39;t want to work on TV, and so your choices have to reflect what your interests are. I think sometimes that was hard for me because of what I was being offered, and sometimes I&#39;ve taken advantage of it in a way that I&#39;m proud of, but it&#39;s been a real balance to learn from. Was it a confidence boost for you to see the positive reactions to those things outside blockbusters? How did those movies and shows affect how you have viewed your career trajectory? I think you do a job because you want to feel fulfilled by the skill that you&#39;re trying to improve upon. &#34;Sorry for Your Loss&#34; for two years was one of the best [examples]. There&#39;s so many hours that were put into that, from pitching it with just a pilot to finishing the sound and the color correction on it. It was something that for two years of my life, I got to learn so much from, and I think that was a big moment that I started to find a different kind of fulfillment out of this job and a different kind of commitment. And I think it&#39;s just because of the hours you spend, just like anything else. So when people write anything positive about your work, of course your ego is grateful because then you think eyes will see it, and then you get a bit more of a boost of the next projects coming in, which is the goal. On her Marvel star power opening doors to more opportunities and feeling empowered to say no Paul Bettany as Vision and Olsen as Wanda in &#34;WandaVision.&#34; Marvel Studios Speaking more broadly, what&#39;s the best business decision that you ever made for your career? Probably doing Marvel, because if you&#39;re thinking about business, you&#39;re thinking about how you&#39;re able to take care of, I guess, a short-term future and a long-term future. Marvel has allowed me to bring eyes and potentially money to projects that are very small and maybe wouldn&#39;t have been seen in other iterations. So I think that&#39;s been very helpful from a business perspective. There&#39;s a piece of advice that you&#39;ve mentioned that has really guided you: &#34;No&#34; is a full sentence. Can you share a time in your career when you felt empowered to put that advice into practice? Well, the ones that first come up, I wouldn&#39;t want to share those because it is very empowering to say no, and I&#39;m also very private with the things I say no to. But it&#39;s an important thing to know that regardless of your own status or power dynamic, you always have that power. I think the biggest one that I can think of &mdash; without saying anything about it &mdash; I look back in hindsight, and I think, &#34;How did I have the confidence to say that?&#34; Because I wasn&#39;t in a position of power. It was very early in my career and I felt so confident to just speak what my boundaries were. So yeah, I think that&#39;s always good advice. It was probably being green that empowered you to just say that, right? Yeah, like, &#34;Whatever! This is what it is. You can either take it or leave it.&#34; I think I became even better at it later. But yeah, I think it is an important thing for everyone.

    "description": "I moved from Hawaii to England for love. My romance started like a fairy-tale, but didn&#39;t have the happy ending I wanted. Ashley Probst I&#39;m an American girl from Hawaii who fell in love with a British boy while studying in London. We started a long-distance relationship, and then I moved to England so we could be together. Six months later, I left feeling I&#39;d over-romanticized the idea of moving abroad for love. I&#39;ve always been obsessed with love stories. Growing up, I devoured every Disney princess movie and romantic comedy I could find, longing for my own happy ending. I fell in love quickly and often, hoping each time that it would finally be with my forever person. When I decided to spend my last semester of college studying abroad in London , I romanticized the experience in a different way. I was excited to explore the city&#39;s rich history, travel across Europe, and make new friends. I had no intention of entering a romantic relationship &mdash; but the moment I stopped looking for love, it found me. The start of our romance felt like magic At first, my new connection and I had so much fun exploring parts of the UK together. Ashley Probst My arrival in London was a whirlwind of navigating culture shock , city life, fresh faces, and an unfamiliar campus. Barely two weeks in, I went out to a bar with a group of women from my study-abroad program and met the man I would fall in love with. We had an instant connection on the dance floor, which led to spending the rest of the night together. We started talking daily and had our first date a week later. Weekly outings turned into overnights, then entire weekends. He invited me to meet his family in his hometown, where we expressed our love for the first time. We took our first of many international trips together and visited Milan , where we ate gelato, drank fine wine, and danced by the canal. During this time, I solo traveled frequently while he stayed in London awaiting my return. When my study-abroad program ended, I moved my belongings into his flat and spent a month traveling around Europe &mdash; a graduation present from my parents &mdash; until it was time to fly home to Maui. I soon realized moving abroad for love wasn&#39;t the fairy-tale I&#39;d been dreaming of Moving to England felt like a big jump. Ashley Probst I never expected to leave London in a long-distance relationship , but our connection had enchanted me. We set a date for him to visit me in Hawaii and found a rhythm of exchanging messages and video calls despite the 11-hour time difference. A few weeks into this routine, he asked me to return to England on a six-month tourist visa so we could be together. I accepted, ecstatic about going back to the country where we fell in love. But this time, my destination wasn&#39;t London. Instead, I moved to Hastings, a seaside town where the last interesting thing to happen there was probably the Battle of Hastings in 1066. I explored the entire place in two days, and boredom quickly set in. Since I was on a tourist visa, I couldn&#39;t work. I was a recent college graduate with no savings, so I didn&#39;t have money for outings or even a pint at the local pub. I felt isolated and relied on my partner for housing and social interaction. Most days, I stayed in the flat watching Netflix and playing video games until he got home. My main recreation became grocery-store runs, walks in the park, and occasional trips out of town. I tried starting various creative projects but was left feeling unfulfilled. Making dinner each night became my only sense of purpose. Shopping for groceries and cooking dinner wasn&#39;t fulfilling enough for me. Ashley Probst Each day blurred into the next, and I sunk deeper into a depression that I didn&#39;t recognize until it had already swallowed me whole. In retrospect, it hit me: I was an unemployed, stay-at-home girlfriend &mdash; and I didn&#39;t like that version of myself. As I struggled, so did our relationship. We fought more frequently, slipping into a cycle that followed us across continents, one that eventually led to our breakup. Now, I know love alone isn&#39;t enough to build a full life My return to England marked a major shift: Instead of arriving with an open mind, I carried expectations for both my time living abroad and the relationship I was chasing. However, the magic from my first visit had faded, and the reality was far from what I had envisioned. I realized love alone couldn&#39;t help me create the life I wanted with another person &mdash; I also needed to feel whole on my own. My experience in Hastings showed me that a healthy relationship requires stability, compatibility, and open communication, but it must be between individuals who both have a strong sense of self and independence. I hadn&#39;t anticipated how much losing the structure of school, work, and social connections would impact my mental health. If I had the chance to do things differently, I&#39;d prioritize finding remote work , building friendships, and taking better care of myself. Our love story didn&#39;t end how I&#39;d hoped, but it was still real, beautiful, and worth remembering &mdash; and I learned invaluable lessons I will never forget. Despite the challenges, I&#39;d do it all over again. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Seniors are flooding AARP with concerns about their Social Security retirement benefits",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/social-security-retirement-benefits-checks-aarp-call-center-doge-cuts-2025-3",
    "description": "AARP said calls have spiked due to seniors worried about their Social Security benefits. Matthias Balk/Picture Alliance via Getty Images AARP reports a surge in calls from retirees concerned about Social Security benefits. Seniors are worried about the Trump administration&#39;s budget cuts at the Social Security Administration. Office closures and staffing cuts could strain the agency as baby boomers retire and demand rises. Anxious retirees have been phoning AARP in droves about their Social Security benefits. A spokesperson said that since February 1, the nonprofit has received roughly 2,000 calls a week on the issue, and &#34;by far the number one&#34; concern is about disruptions to checks. &#34;They&#39;re really struggling to get by and Social Security is their lifeline,&#34; Bill Sweeney, AARP senior vice president, said of older Americans who rely on Social Security benefits to make ends meet. &#34;It&#39;s something they paid into their entire working lives from their very first paycheck until their very last.&#34; The spike in calls is double AARP&#39;s usual volume and is happening in response to the Trump administration&#39;s workforce reductions within the Social Security Administration. Though Trump has promised his administration won&#39;t touch benefits, retirees have reason to be concerned about the service they&#39;ll receive from the agency. Last month, wait times for calling Social Security averaged around an hour and 44 minutes, and Social Security administrators warned that customer service is going to get worse . For example, one change requires beneficiaries to present identification in person rather than online to prevent fraud. However, the agency also announced it would be closing some field offices, a move that could present further challenges to seniors and disabled Americans who don&#39;t have access to transportation or live in remote areas. Business Insider previously spoke to Social Security employees who said the agency was already overwhelmed before the White House&#39;s DOGE office came on the scene. Staffing has reached its lowest levels in 50 years &mdash; and demand for the agency&#39;s services is only growing as a wave of baby boomers hit retirement age. &#34;There&#39;s about 10,000 people turning 65 every single day in this country,&#34; Sweeney told BI. &#34;And there&#39;s more every day than the day before. And yet the staff at Social Security is going down.&#34; Nearly 73 million Americans receive Social Security benefits. Around 40% of older Americans rely solely on monthly checks for their retirement income, according to the National Institute for Retirement Security . The number of Americans over the age of 65 is projected to steadily increase to 80 million in 2040 . Judith Murray, 64, is one of them. Murray previously told BI that she lives on $1,311 a month in Social Security and a $1,174 monthly SNAP allotment in central Illinois. It&#39;s barely enough to cover essentials in a seven-person household, which includes some of her children and grandchildren and her fiancé, who recently lost his job. Any delays in Social Security payment would jeopardize Murray&#39;s ability to pay for housing and groceries &mdash; and she is already already behind on bills and doesn&#39;t have any savings. Murray said that, due to a disability, she&#39;s been relying on Social Security for several decades. Whether it&#39;s a supplement to retirement savings or a sole source of income, Social Security is one of the most popular federal programs with 87% of Americans saying it must remain a priority even with budget deficits. Frank Bisignano, a seasoned finance executive, fielded questions from Democrats during Tuesday&#39;s Senate Finance Committee hearing as Trump&#39;s pick to head the Social Security Administration. Bisignano vowed to continue operating the agency to serve the American people &#34;to ensure that every beneficiary receives their payments on time, that disability claims are processed in the manner they should be.&#34; When asked if he had plans to denationalize the service, he said no. &#34;I&#39;ve never thought about privatizing. It&#39;s not a word that anybody&#39;s ever talked to me about,&#34; the Wall Street veteran continued. &#34;I don&#39;t see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run for the benefit of the American public.&#34; Have a tip or story to share?

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-rich-lawmakers-personal-wealth-stock-trading-2025-3",
    "description": "These days, running for Congress isn&#39;t a cheap endeavor. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images It&#39;s not difficult to find wealthy lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Some members have amassed considerable levels of wealth from business ventures and investments. And it&#39;s not a partisan affair: Democrats and Republicans both have several ultra-rich members. When many Americans think of Capitol Hill, the image of well-heeled politicians often comes to mind. Sure, you don&#39;t have to be a multimillionaire to win a congressional race, but having an abundance of wealth doesn&#39;t hurt. That&#39;s especially the case for candidates who can self-fund, which allows parties to divert critical dollars to nominees in competitive races. While every lawmaker isn&#39;t rich &mdash; even as some have leveraged their profiles to attain lucrative book deals &mdash; there are many members who have net worths of at least $1 million. And then there are the lawmakers who are considerably wealthy, even by congressional standards. Here&#39;s a look at some of the richest members of Congress: Sen. Rick Scott of Florida Scott, who easily won reelection to a second term in November 2024, was a cofounder of HCA Healthcare and Solantic. Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images Scott &mdash; a former two-term Florida Republican governor who won a second term in the Senate in November 2024 &mdash; was a cofounder of both the Columbia Hospital Corporation and Solantic. The corporation merged with HCA in 1994, which created Columbia/HCA, a highly-recognizable operator of hospitals and health care facilities. (It&#39;s now known as HCA Healthcare). The senator has a reliably conservative voting record on Capitol Hill. Business Insider estimates Scott&#39;s net worth to be at least $296.3 million. Quiver Quantitative, a firm that tracks lawmakers&#39; stock trades and estimates their total net worths, estimates that Scott is worth roughly $550.7 million. Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma Hern cofounded a community bank in Oklahoma. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Hern, the current chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, has served in the lower chamber since November 2018. The congressman, who was once a manager at McDonald&#39;s, would eventually own 18 franchise locations in the Tulsa metropolitan area. He was also the cofounder of Firstar Bank, a community banking institution. BI estimates that Hern is worth at least $64.7 million. Quiver Quantitative&#39;s live estimate pegs Hern at $109.4 million. Rep. Darrell Issa of California Issa has long been one of the wealthiest House members. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Issa has represented parts of the San Diego area for more than two decades, with stints in the House from 2001 to 2019 and from 2021 to the present. An ex-chairman of the powerful Oversight Committee during much of former President Barack Obama&#39;s administration, BI estimates that Issa is worth at least roughly $309.4 million. Quiver&#39;s estimate is slightly lower at $234.7 million. The GOP congressman amassed much of his fortune from vehicle anti-theft products. According to his disclosure, Issa has an investment account worth over $50 million. He also has a line of credit at UBS tied to the account, but nothing was borrowed from it in 2023. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California Pelosi led the House Democratic Caucus for 20 years. John Lamparski/Getty Images Pelosi, who has served in the House since 1987, rose through the ranks to become the first female speaker in US history in 2007. When Democrats lost their House majority following the 2010 midterms, Pelosi stayed on as the party&#39;s leader in the lower chamber. She went on to reclaim the speaker&#39;s gavel in 2019, and Democrats retained control of the chamber until 2023. BI estimates that Pelosi is worth at least $50.9 million, while Quiver Quantitative places her at $285.05 million. Pelosi has drawn criticism over the years for enacting stock transactions where she and her husband, Paul Pelosi, have made significant profits. In 2021, Pelosi pushed back against pursuing a stock-trading ban for members when questioned by BI, but later said she&#39;d consider such proposals. (A Democratic-backed bill never came up for a vote in the 117th Congress.) Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia Warner has been seen as a pro-business Democrat throughout his political career. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Warner, a former Virginia governor now in his third term in the Senate, was a cofounder of the Capital Cellular Corporation in the late 1980s and made his fortune through early investments in the cellular telephone business. BI estimates Warner&#39;s worth at least $131.1 million, while Quiver estimates his worth at roughly $245.4 million. The Democratic lawmaker currently serves as the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and also sits on the Banking, Budget, Finance, and Rules committees. Rep. Dan Goldman of New York Prior to Goldman&#39;s election to Congress, he served as an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York. Drew Angerer/Getty Images In 2022, Goldman, an heir to the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. fortune, catapulted to the top of a crowded Democratic Party primary to represent New York&#39;s 10th Congressional District. He went on to easily win the general election race that year. Goldman ranks as one of the House&#39;s wealthiest members. BI estimates he is worth at least $158.1 million, while Quiver estimates that the Levi Strauss heir is roughly $183.6 million. The congressman previously served as an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York and was lead counsel in President Donald Trump&#39;s first impeachment trial. Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska Ricketts and several members of his family are part owners of the Chicago Cubs. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Ricketts, an ex-Nebraska governor and current US senator, is the son of billionaire businessman and TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts. Ricketts &mdash; also a part owner of the Chicago Cubs alongside several members of his family &mdash; is worth at least $79.4 million. Quiver estimates he is worth about $172.9 million. Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington Before coming to Congress, DelBene was an executive at Microsoft. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images DelBene has deep expertise in the world of tech, having served as an executive at Microsoft before jumping into politics and winning her first House race in 2012. The congresswoman, who currently chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is worth at least $70.9 million. Quiver estimates she is worth roughly $126.3 million. Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania McCormick won a hotly-contested Senate race in November 2024. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images McCormick, the former chief executive of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, first sought the GOP nomination for US Senate in 2022 &mdash; but narrowly fell short to celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz. (Oz went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman.) Two years later, McCormick won the Republican Senate nomination and a highly-competitive general election race against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr., an institution in Pennsylvania politics. McCormick is now a freshman senator, and he&#39;s among the body&#39;s wealthiest members. According to BI&#39;s estimates, McCormick is worth at least $123 million. A note about our methodology: Business Insider calculated lawmakers&#39; net worth based on their most recent financial disclosures. Members of Congress only have to estimate broad ranges over their assets. BI&#39;s estimates are based on the combined value of the lowest range of these estimates minus any liabilities lawmakers might have. Lawmakers are not required to report the value of their residence. Based on this conservative approach, BI&#39;s estimates will likely be significantly less than others, including Quiver Qualitative&#39;s. Unlike Quiver, BI did not calculate the live value of lawmakers&#39; stock holdings. Quiver&#39;s live estimates are as of March 25, 2025. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "Juliana Pasquarosa and Grant Ellis are engaged. Anne Marie Fox/Disney/Getty Images There have been over 60 seasons of &#34; Bachelor &#34;-related TV. That means there have also been dozens of &#34;Bachelor&#34; relationships, both failed and successful. The latest season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; concluded on Monday. &#34; The Bachelor &#34; and its related spinoffs are about one thing: finding love. Yet, while there have been over 60 seasons of Bachelor Nation content, there are only 32 couples from the franchise still together. On March 24, Grant Ellis concluded his run as the 29th star of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; by successfully proposing to his season&#39;s winner, Juliana Pasquarosa. That means they&#39;ll be joining this list of couples from the franchise who are still together. Grant Ellis and Juliana Pasquarosa Grant Ellis and Juliana Pasquarosa in 2024. Anne Marie Fox/Disney/Getty Images Grant Ellis proposed to Juliana Pasquarosa during the March 2025 finale of &#34;The Bachelor.&#34; It&#39;s been something of a tough season for Ellis, who was a fan-favorite when he appeared on Jenn Tran&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2024, but he pulled through and found his happily ever after (at least, for now). Joey Graziadei and Kelsey Anderson Graziadei and Anderson. John Fleenor/Disney/ABC Joey Graziadei proposed to Kelsey Anderson during the March 2024 finale of &#34;The Bachelor.&#34; Graziadei has become a fan-favorite lead in this long and storied franchise since he came in second on Charity Lawson&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2023. In fact, his Fantasy Suites episode was the most-watched episode of the show since the 2022 finale of Clayton Echard&#39;s season, according to Variety . So, many people were delighted to see him propose to Anderson on a beach in Tulum and to watch her say yes. They confirmed during &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; that they are still engaged, and have since moved to Los Angeles after Graziadei won &#34;Dancing with the Stars.&#34; Dotun Olubeko and Charity Lawson Lawson and Olubeko in November 2023. Emma McIntyre/Variety/Getty Images Dotun Olubeko got down on one knee and proposed to Charity Lawson, as fans saw on the &#34;Bachelorette&#34; finale in August 2023. Lawson, who appeared on Zach Shallcross&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; earlier in the year, proved herself to be a steadying presence on a show usually filled with drama. &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; viewers saw Olubeko and Lawson develop a strong relationship, grow as a couple, and eventually get engaged in Fiji. &#34;We&#39;re not really trying to have a super incredibly 17-year length engagement,&#34; Lawson told People following the finale. &#34;We obviously came here to find love, and we have successfully done that.&#34; Tessa Tookes and Joey Kirchner Tookes and Kirchner in 2022. CityTv Tessa Tookes, who appeared on Clayton Echard&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; found love on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise Canada&#34; in 2022. She married Joey Kirchner in September 2024. Tookes, who was eliminated during week two of Echard&#39;s season in 2022, provided viewers with a franchise first during the season two finale of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise Canada&#34;: She became the first woman to propose to a man on the show when she asked Kirchner (first seen on season one of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise Canada&#34; in 2021) to marry her. Speaking to Yahoo Canada about her decision, Tookes said, &#34;I know my love for Joey. Even if he declined, I&#39;d still feel really good about making that call. And women can propose.&#34; She added, &#34;It felt really good to do something that&#39;s never been done before.&#34; According to an Instagram post by Tookes, the two wed in September 2024 in Ontario. Zach Shallcross and Kaity Biggar Zach Shallcross and Kaity Biggar in January 2024. James Clark/Disney/Getty Images Fans watched as Zach Shallcross successfully proposed to Kaity Biggar in March 2023. After a very dramatic final week as the lead, Shallcross &mdash; who originally appeared on Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2022 &mdash; got down on one knee in Thailand and proposed to Biggar during the finale, which aired in March 2023. That month, Shallcross told People , &#34;Right now, the main emphasis is living together in Austin, getting to know each other more and more, and just see how things go. There&#39;s no rush.&#34; In July 2023, Biggar posted on Instagram that the two are &#34;officially roommates&#34; in Austin together, and are still together in 2025 &mdash; they even set a wedding date for later this year. Serena Pitt and Joe Amabile Pitt and Amabile in December 2021. Rich Polk/E! Entertainment/NBCUniversal/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Serena Pitt and Joe Amabile got married (again) in Charleston in September 2023 after meeting on the seventh season of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise.&#34; Throughout the entire seventh season of &#34;Paradise,&#34; there wasn&#39;t a stronger couple than &#34;Grocery Store Joe&#34; Amabile (originally from Becca Kufrin&#39;s season in 2018) and Pitt (from Matt James&#39; season in 2021). Even though Amabile&#39;s &#34;Paradise&#34; ex, Kendall Long, showed up at the proposal, nothing could shake their relationship. They left the beach engaged in fall 2021, and just over a year later, they got married at a New York City courthouse with &#34;Paradise&#34; castmate Natasha Parker as a witness. The couple posted footage from their courthouse ceremony to Instagram in October 2022 and wrote in the caption that they still planned to have a wedding the following September. Shortly after getting married, they told People : &#34;We still plan on having a big wedding next fall that we are already planning, but with everything being so public in our relationship, having a private moment just the two of us felt so special and intimate.&#34; In September 2023, they got married again, this time in front of their friends and family &mdash; with &#34;Paradise&#34; bartender Wells Adams officiating. Kenny Braasch and Mari Pepin Braasch and Pepin in January 2024. James Clark/Disney/Getty Images Kenny Braasch and Mari Pepin wed in November 2023, after having a rocky time in &#34;Paradise.&#34; After starting off strong, Pepin, who was on Matt James&#39; season in 2021, decided that she wanted to be able to date other people. Braasch, from Clare Crawley and Tayshia Adams&#39; season in 2020, then started pursuing castmates Demi Burnett and Tia Booth. However, Pepin soon decided she wanted Braasch back, and they got back together. He even proposed at the end of the season. As People reported, the two got married in Puerto Rico in November 2023. Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs Kufrin and Jacobs in June 2022. Dara-Michelle Farr via Getty Images Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs broke up, but they later rekindled their romance off-screen. Now, they&#39;re married, and Kufrin gave birth to their first child in September 2023. After getting dumped on TV by Arie Luyendyk in 2018, Kufrin went on to star in her own season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; that year. She confirmed on an episode of her podcast, &#34;Bachelor Happy Hour,&#34; that her relationship with the winner, Garrett Yrigoyen, ended in 2020. Then, when Kufrin appeared on &#34;Paradise&#34; in 2021, she was hesitant to date Jacobs, who had appeared on Katie Thurston&#39;s season earlier in the year and was portrayed as one of the season&#39;s villains. However, the two built a solid relationship during the show, until Kufrin called things off during the &#34;Paradise&#34; finale. The two reconnected off-screen and began dating. In May 2022, they revealed on Instagram that they&#39;d gotten engaged and, as Kufrin wrote in the caption, &#34;in the ultimate plot twist,&#34; she proposed to Jacobs. In October 2022, Jacobs returned the favor and proposed to Kufrin. &#34;We are so excited! It&#39;s time we can finally start wedding planning,&#34; Kufrin told People at the time. Kufrin announced her pregnancy in April 2023. In September 2023, the two confirmed the birth of their son, Benson, on Instagram. The next month, they tied the knot. Noah Erb and Abigail Heringer Abigail Heringer and Noah Erb in December 2022. Paul Archuleta/Getty Images Noah Erb and Abigail Heringer got married in October 2024. Heringer, from Matt James&#39; season in 2021, and Erb, from Tayshia Adams&#39; season in 2020, went on the first date of their season of &#34;Paradise&#34; and they were together for the entire season, with a few hiccups along the way. In the penultimate episode of the season, Erb decided that he was simultaneously falling in love with Heringer and&nbsp;didn&#39;t think she was &#34;his person.&#34; They left Mexico separately. But like Kufrin and Jacobs, the two reconnected post-&#34;Paradise,&#34; which they confirmed during the reunion in October 2021. The two announced on Instagram in August 2023 that they were engaged, accompanied by a caption that referenced Taylor Swift&#39;s song &#34;Lover.&#34; They wed 14 months later in Oklahoma. Chris Conran and Alana Milne Conran and Milne in December 2021. Paul Archuleta/Getty Images Chris Conran and Alana Milne got kicked off &#34;Paradise&#34; together in 2021. They got engaged in March 2024. Conran, who was eliminated on night one of Clare Crawley&#39;s season in 2020, was originally dating Jessenia Cruz of Matt James&#39; season in 2021, but that changed when Alana Milne, also from James&#39; season, entered the beach. The two quickly decided to pursue a relationship, leaving Cruz in the dust. In turn, everyone on the beach ganged up on them and claimed that they&#39;d been dating pre-&#34;Paradise,&#34; a claim they both denied. After the cast essentially told them that none of them would speak to the couple if they stayed, they left separately. But then Conran and Milne were spotted hanging out together, and Milne confirmed the relationship on her Instagram story, posting a photo of the two kissing captioned, &#34;Paradise is wherever I&#39;m with you.&#34; Conran reposted and wrote: &#34;3 months of no cameras or producers.&#34; In March 2024, the duo posted on Instagram confirming their engagement. Dylan Barbour and Hannah Godwin Barbour and Godwin in June 2022. Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images After a rocky start, Dylan Barbour and Hannah Godwin made it through season six of &#34;BIP.&#34; They got married at a French estate in August 2023. Barbour (from Hannah Brown&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2019) made it clear that he was only there for Godwin &mdash; who was left blindsided on Colton Underwood&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; also in 2019 &mdash; during the first episode of season six of &#34;Paradise&#34; in 2019. However, she needed a little more time to explore things with Blake Horstmann, a runner-up on Becca Kufrin&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette.&#34; Horstmann had even flown down to Alabama to visit her before the two began filming for &#34;Bachelor in Paradise,&#34; a fact that was withheld from the rest of the cast (and the viewing public) until the fourth episode. But Godwin chose to stick with Barbour, and the two got engaged on the finale, which aired in September 2019. They married in August 2023. Dean and Caelynn Bell Dean and Caelynn in December 2022. Steve Granitz/FilmMagic/Getty Images After meeting on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; in 2019, Dean Bell (née) Unglert and Caelynn Bell (née) Miller-Keyes wed in September 2023. When Unglert, who was on Rachel Lindsay&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2017, left &#34;Paradise&#34; early, Miller-Keyes was devastated. But he returned to say he had made a mistake and asked Miller-Keyes to leave Mexico with him to figure out their relationship. This wasn&#39;t a complete surprise, as E! News reported in July 2019 that the two were dating, but fans finally got to see how their relationship unfolded during an episode of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; that aired in September 2019. Miller-Keyes, who made it to hometown dates on Colton Underwood&#39;s season in 2018, left behind her rebound guy, Connor Saeli, from Hannah Brown&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2019 to join Unglert in his much-discussed van. In October 2022, a source told People that Unglert and Miller-Keyes were engaged. That month, Unglert also spoke about the proposal during an episode of his podcast with fellow &#34;Bachelor&#34; alum Jared Haibon. A few days later, Unglert confirmed the news on his Instagram . They married in September 2023 at a Colorado mountain resort outside Aspen and changed their last names to Bell, Unglert&#39;s mother&#39;s maiden name. Kevin Wendt and Astrid Loch Loch and Wendt in August 2018. Paul Hebert via Getty Images Kevin Wendt and Astrid Loch started dating during &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; in 2018. They&#39;re now married with two kids. Known affectionately by their fellow &#34;Paradise&#34; contestants as &#34;Mom and Dad,&#34; the cast was shocked when the most solid couple of the season broke up on the last day of &#34;Paradise&#34; during season five in September 2018. Wendt, straight off a stint on &#34;Bachelor Winter Games&#34; in 2018, copped to still being affected by his split from ex-girlfriend Ashley Iaconetti (who appears elsewhere on this list). Loch, from Nick Viall&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2017, was blindsided. The two were brought together again during the reunion episode. They got engaged in August 2019 and welcomed their son August in November 2021, People reported. They married in October 2022. In February 2023, Loch shared that they were expecting their second child, and their son, Nash, was born in October. Arie Luyendyk and Lauren Burnham Burnham and Luyendyk in July 2018. Presley Ann/Getty Images Arie Luyendyk and Lauren Burnham got engaged on the &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special after Luyendyk shocked the world by dumping Becca Kufrin on TV. They&#39;re now married with three kids. Luyendyk first appeared on the eighth season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2012, competing for the love of Emily Maynard. He eventually became the runner-up. In 2017, ABC made the surprising move to bring him back for the 22nd season&nbsp;of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; where viewers watched him propose to Kufrin . Soon after the proposal, however, Luyendyk decided he had made a mistake and contacted Burnham, the runner-up from his season, before breaking up with Kufrin while the cameras were rolling, making for a controversial moment in Bachelor Nation&#39;s history. Luyendyk and Burnham began their relationship anew, and he proposed to her on the live &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special, which aired after the finale in March 2018. They had a destination wedding in Hawaii in January 2019, People reported, and their daughter, Alessi, was born in May of that year. They later welcomed twins Lux and Senna in June 2021, and are expecting their fourth child this year. Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk Gates and Gottschalk in September 2019. Raymond Hall/Getty Images Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk found love on season four of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise.&#34; They got married in April 2021 and now have two kids together. Gates quickly became a fan favorite while she was a contestant on Nick Viall&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2017. After finishing in second place, she made her way to Mexico for &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; that August where she met Gottschalk, who had been a contestant on Rachel Lindsay&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; earlier that year. In June 2019, they shared matching Instagram posts announcing their engagement. Gates revealed on social media that they postponed their May 2020 wedding due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but they finally married in April 2021, as she shared on Instagram . Their son Gates was born in January 2022, and their son Max was born in July 2023. Jordan Rodgers and JoJo Fletcher Rodgers and Fletcher in 2020. John Fleenor/ABC/Getty Images Jordan Rodgers proposed to JoJo Fletcher during season 12 of &#34;The Bachelorette.&#34; They got married in May 2022. After Fletcher, first seen on Ben Higgins&#39; season in 2016, sent Robby Hayes home, she accepted a proposal from Rodgers on the &#34;The Bachelorette,&#34; which aired later that year. Years later, Fletcher and Rodgers are still together . In fact, in August 2019, Rodgers &#34;re-proposed&#34; to Fletcher, complete with a new ring, as Fletcher shared on Instagram . In May 2022, after six years together and two postponed wedding dates, Fletcher and Rodgers married at a California winery. The couple also had a reality series on CNBC, &#34;Cash Pad,&#34; where they partnered with &#34;homeowners hoping to turn their properties into ideal short-term rentals,&#34; according to the network. They also hosted the competition show &#34;Battle of the Fittest Couples&#34; from October to December 2019 on the Paramount Network, and another competition show, &#34;The Big D,&#34; on USA from June to August 2023. Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Jared Haibon, Ashley Iaconetti, and their son Dawson in January 2023. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti&#39;s love story began in 2015. They married in August 2019, and now have two kids. In 2015, Haibon and Iaconetti competed on Kaitlyn Bristowe and Chris Soules&#39; seasons of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; and &#34;The Bachelor&#34; respectively, and met during the second season of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; in 2015. At the time, Iaconetti was smitten, but Haibon wasn&#39;t as interested. According to a 45-minute video the couple released on Iaconetti&#39;s YouTube channel about&nbsp;how they fell in love, Haibon realized he had to make his move when Iaconetti returned from &#34;Bachelor Winter Games&#34; in 2018 with a boyfriend (Kevin Wendt). Their relationship was made Instagram-official in May 2018, and Haibon proposed just a few weeks later, as E! News reported. The couple married in Rhode Island in August 2019, with a number of Bachelor Nation members in attendance at their wedding, as People reported at the time. In March 2021, they announced their move to Rhode Island on Instagram and opened Audrey&#39;s Coffeehouse and Lounge in South Kingstown. Their son, Dawson, was born in January 2022. In January 2024, Iaconetti and Haibon announced that she was pregnant with their second baby. Their son Hayden was born in July. Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert Tolbert and Roper in November 2019. Paul Archuleta/Getty Images Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert met on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; in 2015 and got married eight months later. They welcomed their third child in November 2020. Tolbert was originally on Kaitlyn Bristowe&#39;s season, while Roper was on Chris Soules&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; both in 2015. But now, &#34;Janner,&#34; as they&#39;re known, are the gold standard for &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; couples. They were the first in the spinoff&#39;s history to get engaged and actually get married &mdash; there had been a few false starts with other couples &mdash; and they have been making it work ever since their finale aired in September 2015. They had their issues &mdash; which were shown on their season of &#34;Marriage Boot Camp&#34; in 2016&nbsp;&mdash; but they worked through them. Their first daughter, Emerson, was born in August 2017. Their son, Brooks, was born in July 2019, after Roper gave birth in her closet, which she shared on Instagram . And in November 2020, they welcomed their third child, Reed. In August 2023, Roper shared on Instagram that she was experiencing &#34;a missed miscarriage,&#34; and said her unborn son&#39;s heart had stopped though her body hadn&#39;t &#34;released the pregnancy yet.&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve been carrying him with so much pride and cherish every moment still left with part of him, but it has also been equally as challenging and devastating,&#34; she wrote. Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici Giudici and Lowe in December 2018. Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Sleep Number Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici remain the sole winning &#34;Bachelor&#34; couple to get married. Giudici gave birth to their third child in December 2019. Lowe is the only &#34;Bachelor&#34; lead (season 17, 2013) who has stayed with the winner of his season &mdash; both Jason Mesnick and Arie Luyendyk returned to the runners-up of their seasons. Lowe had previously appeared on Emily Maynard&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2012. As People reported, Lowe and Giudici had their first son, Samuel, in July 2016, two years after their televised wedding in 2014. Their second son, Isaiah, was born in June 2018. Their third child, a daughter they named Mia, was born in December 2019. Chris Siegfried and Desiree Hartsock Hartsock and Siegfried in August 2018. Earl Gibson III/Getty Images for WE tv Chris Siegfried proposed to Desiree Hartsock on season nine of &#34;The Bachelorette.&#34; They got married in 2015 and had their first child in 2016, their second in January 2019, and their third in November 2024. Hartsock originally appeared on Sean Lowe&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2013, but she was sent home. Her season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; was especially controversial &mdash; she was broken up with by Brooks Forester during the second-to-last week of the show, who many considered to be the frontrunner. Some fans believed Hartsock was settling when she accepted Siegfried&#39;s proposal back in August 2013. Despite the controversy, Siegfried and Hartsock got married in January 2015. Their son, Asher, was born a year later. In July 2018, the couple told Us Weekly that they were expecting their second child, Zander. He was born in January 2019. Also, in 2018, the couple appeared on &#34;Marriage Boot Camp,&#34; a show where couples confront the marital issues they&#39;re facing. They decided to stay together and work on their relationship. In May 2024, Siegfried announced she was pregnant with their third child. Their son, Noah, was born that November. Joan Vassos and Chock Chapple Vassos and Chapple in December 2024. Jesse Grant/Getty Images for iHeartRadio Our very first &#34;Golden Bachelorette&#34; Joan Vassos got engaged to Chock Chapple during the season finale that aired in November 2024. Vassos had appeared on &#34;The Golden Bachelor&#34; to compete for Gerry Turner&#39;s heart, but she had to exit in week three due to a family emergency. In May 2024, she was named the star of the first season of &#34;The Golden Bachelorette.&#34; Chapple was a frontrunner throughout the season, so it wasn&#39;t a big surprise when he got down on one knee and proposed. According to social media, the two are still together and planning to move to New York City. Holly Durst and Blake Julian Julian and Durst in 2011. Rick Rowell/Disney General Entertainment Content/Getty Images Studios; Greg Zabilski/Disney General Entertainment Content/Getty Images Holly Durst and Blake Julian have the distinction of being the only successful couple from the short-lived spinoff series &#34;Bachelor Pad.&#34; They have two kids. Durst and Julian met during the second season of &#34;Bachelor Pad&#34; in 2011. Julian was fresh off Ashley Hebert&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette,&#34; and Durst had last been seen on Matt Grant&#39;s season in 2008. Julian&#39;s proposal was announced during the season finale. The two got married in June 2012. In July 2019, Durst posted an Instagram video detailing their 7-year struggle with infertility, IVF, miscarriages, and surrogacy. In September 2019, Julian and Durst revealed on Instagram that&nbsp;they had adopted a baby, Poppy. Then, in January 2023, they announced the adoption of their son, Knox. Jason Mesnick and Molly Malaney Mesnick and Malaney in January 2024. James Clark/Disney/Getty Images Jason Mesnick proposed to Melissa Rycroft on the finale of his season of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; but revealed on &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; that he was still in love with runner-up Molly Malaney. They celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary in 2024. Mesnick was originally on DeAnna Pappas&#39; season in 2008. He proposed to Rycroft, dumped her on &#34;After the Final Rose,&#34; and immediately asked Malaney if they could resume their relationship in March 2009, which they discussed during an interview with People that month. Malaney and Mesnick were engaged later that year in October 2009, Mesnick confirmed to Us Weekly , and were married just a few months later. Now, they&#39;re one of the few &#34;Bachelor&#34; success stories, even if their love story didn&#39;t start off in the most conventional way. They had their daughter Riley in 2013. Things worked out for Rycroft, too. After the breakup, she reunited with her ex, Tye Strickland. They got married in 2009, and have three kids. Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter Sutter and Rehn in January 2024. James Clark/Disney/Getty Images Trista Rehn was the very first &#34;Bachelorette&#34; and set a high bar for the franchise &mdash; she&#39;s been with the winner of her season, Ryan Sutter, since 2003. Just uttering the words &#34;Trista and Ryan&#34; around a &#34;Bachelor&#34; fan will send them on a trip down memory lane. The year was 2003, and Trista was the very first &#34;Bachelorette,&#34; after getting sent home as the runner-up of the first season of &#34;The Bachelor.&#34; Rehn chose Sutter in the finale, and he proposed. Their wedding was televised (the first of the franchise) and shown as a miniseries called &#34;Trista and Ryan&#39;s Wedding &#34; in December 2003. Rehn also appeared on the first season of &#34;Dancing with the Stars&#34; in 2005, and the couple appeared on &#34;Marriage Boot Camp&#34; in 2014. They&#39;re still married, live in Colorado, and have two kids, Max and Blakesley. Brendan Morais and Serene Russell Brendan Morais and Serene Russell. Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images Brendan Morais and Serene Russell shocked &#34;Bachelor&#34; fans when they hard-launched their relationship on Instagram in March 2025 &mdash; there hadn&#39;t been any speculation about their relationship at all. It&#39;s been a minute since either was on TV, but here&#39;s where you know them from: Morais was initially on Tayshia Adams&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2020, but left because he wasn&#39;t ready to propose. He then controversially appeared on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; in 2021 &mdash; although he spent the beginning of the season pursuing Natasha Parker, it was revealed he was basically killing time until Pieper James (from Matt James&#39; season in 2021) walked on the beach. They dated for a while but eventually broke up at some point in 2023 or 2024. Russell first appeared on Clayton Echard&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2022. That same year, she traveled to Mexico for season eight of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; and got engaged to Brandon Jones (Michelle Young&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette,&#34; 2021). They broke up in 2023. It&#39;s unclear how Morais and Russell met, but the two seem to be going strong. Brayden Bowers and Christina Mandrell Bowers and Mandrell in January 2024. Eric McCandless/Disney/Getty Images Brayden Bowers proposed to Christina Mandrell in January 2024 on live TV. They eloped in Nashville in December. Bowers, of Lawson&#39;s season, might have been eliminated from &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; after failing to secure a rose, but he was still able to find love within the franchise. During the finale of season nine of &#34;Paradise,&#34; which aired in December 2023, it was revealed that Bowers has been dating Mandrell, from Shallcross&#39; season, for the last few months. &#34;Beyond the cameras and reality show drama, Brayden (aka MY BOYFRIEND!) and I found something truly special,&#34; Mandrell wrote on Instagram . On the red carpet of Turner and Nist&#39;s televised wedding in January, Bowers got down on one knee and proposed to Mandrell, who accepted, as seen on Instagram. They surprised fans later that year by eloping, per People . Anna Redman and Chris Bukowski Bukowski in 2019 and Redman in 2021. Paul Archuleta/Getty Images Anna Redman and Chris Bukowski announced their relationship on Instagram in March 2022. Redman and Bukowski, both Chicago residents, made their relationship Instagram-official in March 2022, with Redman captioning a series of photos &#34;hard launch.&#34; They moved in together a few months later. While these two never interacted on-screen, they&#39;re both &#34;Bachelor&#34; alums. Bukowski has famously appeared on multiple seasons, including Emily Maynard&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette,&#34; season three of &#34;Bachelor Pad,&#34; and three seasons of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise.&#34; He unsuccessfully attempted to join Andi Dorfman&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; as well. Bachelor Nation reported that Bukowski got engaged to Katie Morton on his last appearance on &#34;Paradise&#34; in 2019, but they broke up a few months later, according to a since-deleted Instagram post. You might remember Redman from her controversial appearance on Matt James&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2021 when she spread rumors that a fellow contestant was &#34;entertaining men for money.&#34; She later briefly appeared on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; later that year. According to an episode of Joe Amabile&#39;s podcast &#34;Clickbait,&#34; Amabile and his wife, Serena Pitt, introduced the two. Jordan Chapman and Corrinne Jones Chapman and Jones in November 2021. Hatnim Lee/Getty Images Jordan Chapman and Corrinne Jones never appeared on-screen together, but they found love in Bachelor Nation. Chapman and Jones, from Clayshia&#39;s season in 2020 and Matt James&#39; season in 2021, respectively, made their Instagram debut in September 2021. They got engaged in September 2024. It&#39;s unclear how exactly they met since they never overlapped on our TV screens, but Bachelor Nation is well-connected. Mike Renner and Olivia Miller Renner in 2018 and Miller in 2022. Craig Sjodin/ABC/Getty Images; Ricky Middlesworth/ABC/Getty Images Mike Renner and Olivia Miller are Bachelor Nation&#39;s self-proclaimed &#34;most irrelevant&#34; couple. They got engaged in July 2024. If you remember either of these former &#34;Bachelor&#34; contestants, you&#39;re a true super-fan. Renner, a sports analyst, was eliminated during week three of Becca Kufrin&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2018. Miller, a stylist, is a more recent contestant, appearing on Zach Shallcross&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2023, but she was sent home during night one. They hard-launched their relationship in June 2023, according to Bachelor Nation , by calling themselves &#34;Bachelor Nation&#39;s most irrelevant couple.&#34; Just over a year later, in July 2024, Renner proposed to Miller. Peyton Wright and Chris Lambton Wright and Lambton in May 2012. David L Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images Peyton Wright and Chris Lambton also never interacted on-screen, but they met through friends from Bachelor Nation. Wright and Lambton were never part of the same show &mdash; Wright appeared on the 10th season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; competing for Andy Baldwin&#39;s heart in 2007 but was left behind on a two-on-one date. She later appeared on the first season of &#34;Bachelor Pad.&#34; Lambton, on the other hand, made it all the way to the final two in Ali Fedotowsky&#39;s season of&nbsp; &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2010, and even turned down the opportunity to be the next &#34;Bachelor,&#34; he told Boston.com . The two didn&#39;t find love on TV, but hit it off when they were introduced to each other by friends from the Bachelor Nation at a golf tournament in 2010, People reported in 2013. They got married in May 2012 and have been together since. &#34;I&#39;m so glad Andy Baldwin left me standing there on that aircraft carrier,&#34; Wright told People ahead of the couple&#39;s first anniversary in 2013.&nbsp;&#34;I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t go any further because it wouldn&#39;t have worked out.&#34; They have two children: a daughter, Lyla, who was born in November 2016, and a son, Hayes, who was born in December 2018. The couple hosted the HGTV show &#34;Going Yard,&#34; which ran for two seasons. They also collaborated with HSN on a furniture line called Chris and Peyton by Design. Jesse Csincsak and Ann Lueders Csincsak and Lueders in August 2010. Denise Truscello/Getty Images Jesse Csincsak won the season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; he appeared on in 2008 and proposed to DeAnna Pappas, but the two broke up after a few months. His future wife, Ann Lueders, was eliminated on night one of Jason Mesnick&#39;s season in 2009. The couple met on a &#34;Bachelor&#34; reunion cruise that Csincsak organized. He told Hollywood 411 in 2017 that he &#34;realized that there were a lot of women who had gone on the show who were also single and could understand what I was going through.&#34; Csincsak added that he began inviting past contestants to the reunions he hosted. &#34;Ann just happened to come on the first cruise I hosted to Mexico and the rest is history,&#34; he said. Csincsak and Lueders married in 2010 while Lueders was pregnant with their first child, Noah. According to&nbsp; Us Weekly , their daughter Charlotte was born three years later, and their third child, Brian, was born in December 2016. Tara Durr and John Presser Presser and Durr in January 2011. Taylor Hill/WireImage/Getty Images Tara Durr and John Presser were both sent home on night one of their respective seasons, and they met on a private &#34;Bachelor&#34; alumni Facebook group. Durr was eliminated after night one of Lorenzo Borghese&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2006, and Presser was eliminated after night one of Jillian Harris&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2009. According to People , they met through a private &#34;Bachelor&#34; alumni Facebook group in July 2009 and were engaged by February 2010. They were married later that year, in November, the St. Augustine Record reported at the time. They have a son, Warner, and a daughter, Ellery. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Digital clutter is still clutter. It takes time, but here's how to tackle it. ",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/professional-declutterer-shares-tips-to-handle-digital-clutter-2025-3",
    "description": "The author (not pictured) shares how to tackle digital clutter. Jacques Julien/Getty Images I&#39;m a professional declutterer and work with clients to get rid of things they don&#39;t need anymore. Digital clutter can be as time-consuming as physical clutter. Try unsubscribing to five emails you don&#39;t want a day to clear your inbox. Digital clutter is real , and you&#39;ve likely got some, particularly if you&#39;re paying for extra storage space. Holding on to extra files, apps, and other digital assets not only costs money, but it&#39;s also costing us all in terms of the environment. In fact, computing has now surpassed the airline industry&#39;s carbon footprint . It turns out the cloud is not, in fact, a gentle, fluffy, amorphous part of the atmosphere. Instead, hundreds of server farms use vast amounts of water and electricity. And every email, photo, and meme you&#39;ve got on your devices is contributing to the problem. So, how do you rid yourself of the excess? Just like physical decluttering , it takes time and effort, but it can be done and doesn&#39;t have to cause you pain and suffering. Start with your email Most of us receive more than we could ever read, so start with unsubscribing . Yes, it&#39;s easier to simply delete, but if you&#39;d like to avoid getting weekly or even daily marketing emails from that candle company you gave your email address to in order to save 10% on your only purchase, you&#39;ve got to go to the source. Feeling overwhelmed? See who you&#39;re getting unwanted emails from, whether that&#39;s marketing, newsletters, or alerts, and try unsubscribing from five per day. While you are at it, try deleting every email after you&#39;ve read it; this will make your inbox more manageable. Delete apps you don&#39;t use Apps are fun and useful at the best of times but drain your battery and storage at the worst. Scroll through your list to see which ones you&#39;re using and which you can delete. While you&#39;re at it, make sure you&#39;re not paying for any that you don&#39;t use. There&#39;s no need for FOMO when it comes to apps; if you find you&#39;d like an app back, it takes just seconds to download it back onto your device. Purge your contacts Do you have contacts labeled &#34;Bill &mdash; dishwasher guy&#34; or simply &#34;Edith&#34; with no other distinguishing features? It&#39;s time to go through the list and delete anyone whose name you do not recognize or who is no longer a part of your life. In the worst-case scenario, if they text you again, you can always ask who they are and save them again with all of their information. Bookmarks are helpful if organized Bookmarks are helpful until you have a list longer than your arm with no discernible organization. The whole point of bookmarking websites is so that you can find them again easily. If your collection is a mishmash of recipes, tax preparation advice, and articles you&#39;re still planning to read, it&#39;s time to do some tidying. Think of those bookmarks as pieces of paper strewn around your desk. If they&#39;re not in file folders, you&#39;ve just got a mess on your hands. So, set up a filing system, but mostly? Simply delete. Unorganized digital folders are not helpful This is a good time to determine what the word &#34;important&#34; means to you. Does every file you&#39;ve ever created have equal weight? Or are some of them languishing in digital folders because you just can&#39;t quite figure out what to do with them? Chances are you&#39;re keeping a lot of stuff that&#39;s out of date or just not relevant to your current life or work. Use a critical eye, and don&#39;t be scared to use the delete key. If the information is available elsewhere on the internet (bank statements, recipes), let someone else pay to store it and access it when necessary. While you&#39;re at it, look at your file structure. Does it lend itself to easy retrieval? If you can&#39;t figure out what should go where, take a look at your paper files. See if you can use the same organizational system for your digital info. We tend to assume we have more time (and interest) to get back to things than we do. It&#39;s so easy to download a thing, bookmark it, or flag it for later. But the reality is that the internet is vast and growing every day. There&#39;s hardly time to take in what&#39;s coming at you today, let alone to look backward at what caught your eye last month. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "CIA director John Ratcliffe defends involvement in botched Signal chat, denies sharing classified information",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/cia-head-signal-use-senate-hearing-the-atlantic-tulsi-gabbard-2025-3",
    "description": "CIA Director John Ratcliffe testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday. Valerie Plesch for The Washington Post via Getty Images CIA Director John Ratcliffe testified that using Signal for work is allowed by the CIA. The Atlantic&#39;s editor-in-chief was added to a Signal chat where Trump officials discussed war plans. Trump intelligence officials claimed in a Senate hearing that no classified info was shared. Using the encrypted messaging app Signal is permitted by the CIA, Trump&#39;s CIA director says. In an explosive Monday report from The Atlantic, editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg detailed how he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat in which Trump administration national security leaders discussed upcoming strikes on Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels . The outlet&#39;s report was a hot topic at a tense Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday, where US intelligence officials were asked what was discussed in the Signal group chat, and whether it was classified. When questioned by Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee&#39;s vice chairman, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said that he was part of the Signal group chat reported by The Atlantic. He also said that the CIA routinely uses the end-to-end encrypted app. &#34;One of the first things that happened when I was confirmed as CIA director was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA as it is for most CIA officers,&#34; Ratcliffe said. He said that the CIA records management team briefed him on the permissible use of Signal as a practice that he said was also allowed under the Biden administration. &#34;It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes. Provided that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels. So those were procedures that were implemented. My staff implemented those processes,&#34; Ratcliffe said. &#34;My communications, to be clear, in a Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,&#34; he added. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was apparently also in the chat, according to Goldberg. She at first refused to answer questions on Tuesday about whether she was in it, but later implied that she was when she repeatedly said she could not &#34;recall&#34; specific content discussed in the Signal group. Last week, the Pentagon sent out internal guidance warning about the vulnerability of using Signal, according to NPR . &#34;Russian professional hacking groups are employing the &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations,&#34; the memo reads. &#34;Please note: third-party messaging apps (e.g. Signal) are permitted by policy for unclassified accountability/recall exercises but are not approved to process or store non-public unclassified information.&#34; Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard said that the information discussed in the chat was not classified. But Sen. Warner and other Democrats repeatedly argued that the Signal chat likely contained classified information. &#34;This pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy,&#34; Warner said. &#34;Make no mistake, these actions make America less safe.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "'Napster? Is it 1999?' Millennials react with disbelief at $207 million sale.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/napster-making-comeback-metaverse-music-platform-millennials-2025-3",
    "description": "A New York University student downloaded music from Napster in 2001. Spencer Platt/Getty Images Napster is back? If you&#39;re confused, you&#39;re not alone. Internet users expressed disbelief that the brand still existed &mdash; let alone had sold for $207 million. &#34;Napster? Is it 1999?&#34; The news on Tuesday that Napster had been sold for $207 million sparked disbelief as millennials experienced a hearty dose of nostalgia. The controversial OG music-sharing platform, founded in 1999 by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker and shut down by court order in 2001 after throwing the music industry into a panic, has been purchased by the 3D tech company Infinite Reality. The company appears to be planning to use the brand for a &#34;Fortnite&#34; concerts-like metaverse play , writing that it wants to use Napster to &#34;create branded 3D virtual spaces where fans can enjoy virtual concerts.&#34; The internet quickly let the jokes and memes rip. &#34;What next, you gonna tell me Limewire sold for $100 million??&#34; one Redditor wrote. &#34;Napster still exists?&#34; another wrote. Others let a popular Robin Williams &#34;What YEAR is it?&#34; meme express their confusion. Reddit users shared a popular GIF of Robin Williams in &#34;Jumanji&#34; to express their confusion at the Napster news. Reddit Then there was the sticker shock. &#34;I like to think I understand tech but I have no idea how this is worth over $200 million,&#34; one internet user wrote. Some shared nostalgic memories of the freewheeling nature of the music-file-sharing era. &#34;I remember coming home from high school being the king pin of burnt various song CD&#39;s and seeing Napster shutdown,&#34; one wrote. And it turns out that the Napster of today still has users. &#34;As a Napster/Rhapsody subscriber for the last 10 years, yes it was still around and you were missing out,&#34; another wrote. &#34;It was by far the best music service for price, library and sound.&#34; Other Napster users wondered whether the sale to a new company would change the service. &#34;I actually still use napster and enjoy it. Hope this doesnt change that,&#34; one Redditor wrote. &#34;I mean I use it everyday. Never had any issues,&#34; they added. &#34;I would say the library isn&#39;t big as Spotify. I like weird music sometimes I hear in random Internet s&mdash;t and I&#39;d say I can find 80% of it on Napster.&#34; The Napster you remember has been gone for decades Napster has changed hands multiple times since its court-ordered shutdown in 2001. Portland Press Herald via Getty Images For many millennials, the beep, hiss, and hum of dial-up internet was a necessary prelude to listening to Britney Spears&#39; &#34;Baby One More Time&#34; or Lou Bega&#39;s &#34;Mambo No. 5.&#34; Years before there was on-demand streaming or officially licensed song downloads, Napster shook up the music industry with technology that allowed users to easily share their audio files with other people around the world for free. In the comparatively lawless days of these early internet startups, this approach proved to be a little too disruptive and the company was soon sued into oblivion. The Recording Industry of America Association and the heavy-metal group Metallica argued that the service allowed illegal transfers that encouraged the violation of artists&#39; copyrights (and deprived them of revenue from album sales). Soon, the original website was shut down. Over the years, the brand and assets were sold to a string of owners, including Roxio, Best Buy, and Rhapsody. Even with its ups and downs, the company left its mark on modern media distribution &mdash; it was Daniel Ek&#39;s inspiration for Spotify &mdash; and the former piracy platform has since transformed into a modestly sized business that now plays by the rules. As one Redditor succinctly put it: &#34;The Napster of today has nothing to do with the Napster of 25 years ago.&#34; Now, Napster&#39;s story appears to have another chapter, and its new owner seems ready to push once again into uncharted territory. Infinite Reality, which bills itself as an immersive reality company, announced in January that it raised around $3 billion from an undisclosed investor. The metaverse company has been acquisitive in the past, purchasing the esports and influencer company ReKTGlobal in 2022 and the immersive tech company Landvault in 2024. As it happens, Napster now has the licenses to (legally) stream millions of music tracks, and John Acunto, Infinite Reality&#39;s CEO, told CNBC the plan is to build virtual spaces for concerts, listening parties, and merch sales. &#34;When we think about clients who have audiences &mdash; influencers, creators &mdash; I think it&#39;s very important that they have a connected space that&#39;s around music and musical communities,&#34; Acunto told the outlet. &#34;We just don&#39;t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.&#34; &#34;I think there&#39;s no better name than Napster to disrupt,&#34; he added.

    "description": "A traffic policeman in front of the Ryugyong Hotel in 2019. Dita Alangkara/AP Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, North Korea, is one of the tallest unoccupied buildings in the world. Construction on the &#34;Hotel of Doom&#34; began in 1987 and has stopped and started several times. One side of the 1,080-foot building has been outfitted with LED screens used for light shows. At 1,080 feet, North Korea &#39;s Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang is one of the tallest unoccupied buildings in the world. The 105-story &#34;Hotel of Doom,&#34; which is also North Korea&#39;s tallest building, has never hosted a single guest. Construction began almost 40 years ago, and it is not yet complete &mdash; the cost of finishing the building is estimated to be around 5% of the country&#39;s entire GDP. Still, Ryugyong Hotel remains a subject of international fascination. Here&#39;s the story behind the abandoned skyscraper that dominates the capital city&#39;s skyline. Construction on the Ryugyong Hotel began in Pyongyang in 1987, but halted due to economic troubles in North Korea. The Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 1990.

Eric Lafforgue/Art In All Of Us/Corbis via Getty Images Despite its aversion to foreign visitors, North Korea does have several functional hotels in Pyongyang. Until the Ryugyong Hotel is completed, the Yanggakdo International Hotel is the city&#39;s largest, and the Ryanggang Hotel is widely regarded as the fanciest. Its pyramid shape dominates the Pyongyang skyline from miles away. The Ryugyong Hotel is visible from outside Pyongyang. Greg Baker/AP Each of the building&#39;s three sections, which join together at the top, are 100 meters, or 328 feet long, Atlas Obscura &nbsp;reported. At the very top of the building, an eight-story cone-shaped section was supposed to feature revolving restaurants. The top of the Ryugyong Hotel in 2015.

Eric Lafforgue/Art In All Of Us/Corbis via Getty Images An Egyptian contractor, the Orascom group, took over the project and revived construction in 2008,&nbsp; Reuters reported. It would cost an estimated $2 billion to finally finish the Ryugyong Hotel, Reuters reported in 2008, citing South Korean media. A crane on the roof of the Ryugyong Hotel. Eric Lafforgue/Art In All Of Us/Corbis via Getty Images North Korea&#39;s gross domestic product is around $40 billion, according to the most recent data on CIA&#39;s World Factbook . That makes the cost of finishing the building around 5% of the country&#39;s entire GDP. In the meantime, North Korea has found other uses for the building.

It serves as a dramatic backdrop for performances by art troupes. Members of a Socialist Women&#39;s Union propaganda troupe perform in front of the Ryugyong Hotel in 2019.

Dita Alangkara/AP In 2018, lighting designer Kim Yong Il created a light show comprised of political slogans and party symbols. It played on the building&#39;s surface for several hours every night. The building itself still lacks electricity, and there&#39;s no expected completion date, but there have been new signs of construction progress.

Ng Han Guan/AP Alek Sigley, an Australian student who was studying for his master&#39;s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il Sung University, posted on X about new signage above the main entrance of the hotel in June 2019. A month later, Sigley was detained for a week and subsequently released after North Korean authorities accused him of committing &#34;spying acts&#34; against the state. He was later expelled from the country. North Korean authorities are reportedly hoping to find a foreign investor to build a casino in the empty space. A casino in Pyongyang. PEDRO UGARTE/AFP via Getty Images Radio Free Asia reported in July 2024 that North Korean leadership is seeking a foreign investor to purchase gambling rights and operate a casino at the Ryugyong Hotel as part of a deal to finish the rest of its interior. Authorities hope to replicate the success and profitability of the casino at Pyongyang&#39;s Yanggakdo International Hotel, which has proven popular with tourists, the outlet reported, citing an anonymous North Korean source. It continues to live up to its nickname, &#34;Hotel of Doom.&#34; The Ryugyong Hotel rises above the city skyline, shrouded by a layer of mist. Wong Maye-E/AP The hotel&#39;s actual name, &#34;Ryugyong,&#34; comes from a historical name for Pyongyang meaning &#34;capital of willows.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL’s Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether. At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player. She failed countless times before she began to soar. Continue reading...",

The Golden State Warriors missed the playoffs in 2020 and 2021, but they stormed back from the abyss in 2022 to beat the Boston Celtics in the NBA finals. Steph Curry was 33 for most of that season. Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were 31. The Warriors’ return to the pinnacle of basketball had the whiff of a last hurrah, and indeed, their championship core faded for a second time after that: a second-round exit in 2023, a play-in tournament flatlining in 2024. Curry and his four-time championship-winning teammates continued to get older in the way athletes do. Continue reading...",

Little wonder that Team Ingebrigtsen became the most popular TV show in Norwegian history. But on Tuesday a courtroom in Sandnes, in the south-west of the country, heard that the reality inside the family home was far bleaker, with harrowing stories of violence, threats and manipulative behaviour from Gjert towards Jakob, the double Olympic champion, and his younger sister, Ingrid.

    "description": "Team Melli make their fourth straight World Cup Country likely to face restrictions in a Trump travel ban Iran have become the sixth team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup thanks to their 2-2 draw with Uzbekistan at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran on Tuesday. Iran join Japan and New Zealand as the first countries to have punched their ticket via the usual qualification process, while co-hosts United States, Mexico and Canada qualified automatically. Internazionale striker Mehdi Taremi was largely to thank for Team Melli’s accomplishment on Tuesday, scoring both goals in an otherwise sloppy performance from Iran. The Iranian defense let in two soft goals from Uzbekistan, who will secure their first-ever World Cup finals place with a victory in either of their two remaining qualifiers. Continue reading...",

The top-seeded Trojans kept going without their star player, pummeling Mississippi State 96-59 to reach the Sweet 16 for the second straight year, but the injury cast a shadow over the entire evening as one of college basketball’s biggest stars was left in serious distress. Watkins was streaking to the basket chased by two defenders when her knee bent awkwardly as she planted her right leg, the non-contact injury causing her to crumple to the floor. The crowd went silent as she writhed in pain and clutched her knee while her teammates looked on helplessly and USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb rushed to her side. ESPN reported that the 19-year-old has torn her ACL and will undergo surgery. Watkins was averaging 24.6 points this season for USC. Continue reading...",
