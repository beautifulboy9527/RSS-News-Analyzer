    "description": "GeoGuessr, the geography game that tasks players with guessing a location in the world based on a random Google Street View image, is coming to Steam . It’s slated to hit early access on the platform sometime in April. That should hopefully make the game much easier to access on Steam Deck without having to fiddle with browser settings on desktop mode. The developers are taking the early access approach on Steam so they can &quot;refine the gameplay, introduce new features and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players&quot; with the aim of making &quot;the ultimate competitive and casual geography game.&quot; The early access version on Steam will at the very least have a competitive solo mode and casual Team Duels, though there are plans to add more modes and competitive features in the coming months. GeoGuessr has a fairly thriving competitive scene — this year&#39;s world championship has a $100,000 prize pool — so you could stand to cash in if you become great at the game. But be warned: if you think pro GeoGuessr might be your calling, you&#39;ll be up against some incredibly skilled players. They can pinpoint parts of the world based on corn growing at the side of a road , clouds in the sky and room decor . GeoGuessr pros are absolutely absurd. It&#39;s not clear how much the full Steam version will cost. A free version will include unlimited access to the amateur division, which is GeoGuessr&#39;s lowest rank, as well as unranked Team Duels. A Steam Pass that&#39;s available to purchase inside the game will be required to access the full Solo Duels mode. The store page notes that the price won&#39;t change during the time the game is in early access (a period that&#39;s expected to be at least six months). Nor do the developers expect to increase the price when the game exits early access. The original, 12-year-old web version allows players to make three free daily guesses, but to play more you have to pay for a subscription, which starts at $2.50 per month. Unlimited access on the mobile apps is available on the $3 per month Pro Unlimited plan. While there will be cross-play between Steam and the browser/mobile versions, the current GeoGuessr plans don&#39;t include full access to the Steam edition.

    "description": "You can pick up the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for only $20 right now thanks to Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . Not only is that a $15 discount, but its only a couple of dollars more than the record-low price we&#39;ve tracked. Amazon released the Fire TV Stick HD last October and, soon after, it became the top budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices . It&#39;s a basic stre2amer that received a couple of much-needed updates when Amazon revamped its Fire TV devices last year. The Fire TV Stick HD has HDR support and streams with full HD resolution. It also comes with an Alexa-powered remote control, which lets you search for titles with just a click of the Alexa button. That remote also has Netflix and Prime Video buttons, but the device can run most streaming apps, like Disney+ and Peacock.&nbsp; Elsewhere in the Fire TV lineup, you can grab the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for only $40 thanks to Amazon Spring Sale deals. This is the most powerful streaming dongle Amazon makes, with support for 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos, Wi-Fi 6E and Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass gaming.

    "description": "It turns out Nintendo Directs are like buses. You wait ages for one then get two in quick succession. Days before Nintendo fully spills the beans on the Switch 2 during a dedicated showcase on April 2 , the company is hosting a surprise Direct on March 27 at 10AM ET. You can watch it above. The stream will run for around 30 minutes and focus on upcoming Switch games. There won&#39;t be any Switch 2 info, but pretty much every game you see here will run on the new console anyway, thanks to backwards compatibility . Since this isn&#39;t billed as an Indie World Direct (those focus on indie games), it&#39;s not really clear what we can expect from this one. Nintendo&#39;s developers will largely be focused on making Switch 2 games at this point. Still, the Switch has a massive install base — the company has sold more than 150 million of those consoles — so Nintendo probably won&#39;t want to leave all those players behind any time soon.&nbsp; To that end, we can expect a stream of games for the original Switch to keep coming for the foreseeable future. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond , for instance, is still slated to hit the Switch sometime this year . Third-party games will still be coming to the Switch as well, including a certain one from Team Cherry that we expect to show up in every single gaming showcase but won&#39;t mention here because we don&#39;t want to jinx it.

    "description": "The Amazon Big Spring Sale is here and, like last year, the discounts appear to be more focused on kitchen, fashion and cleaning supplies. Those last two categories don’t really apply to what we cover here at Engadget. Cooking gear, however, is getting more and more tech-reliant and the intersection of food and tech is a place we feel very comfortable. We’ve reviewed Instant Pots , air fryers , coffee gear , sous vide machines and more. Lots of the gadgets and appliances we recommend are now on sale for Amazon’s latest shopping event. Read on for the best deals on kitchen tech we could find. The best Amazon Spring Sale deals on air fryers, Instant Pots and more Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $140 ($40 off) : The powerful Juice Fountain impressed us with its extraction abilities. Plus it’s relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This price isn’t as low as the $110 Amazon sold it for back in January, but this is the lowest price we’ve tracked since then. Cosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off) : Cosori’s fryer earned a spot as the runner up for best overall air fryer in our guide. It has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity. We like that it doesn’t take up too much space, but can still cook up a decent amount of food Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off) : If you want a more traditional toaster oven design with a huge capacity, go for our premium air fryer pick. The fryer-and-oven combo can accommodate a five-quart dutch oven, so it’s almost an auxiliary oven, which could come in handy when you’re cooking for a crowd. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it went for $300 at the end of last year. Breville the Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off) : This is the non-Pro version of the Breville air fryer we recommend . It has a slightly smaller capacity (0.8 cubic feet instead of one cubic foot) and is missing two cooking functions (dehydrate and proof). But if you’re not making your own jerky or baking a ton of bread, this one can toast, broil, air fry and slow cook. You can even get it in cool colors like Red Velvet Cake for the same price. Ninja DZ401 Foodi 10-quart air fryer for $190 ($40 off) : If you need to air fry two different foods at once, go for our recommendation for a dual-zone air fryer. It’s a beast, so we think it’s best for larger kitchens and people who make big meals. It went as low as $130 for Black Friday last year, but this is the cheapest price we’ve seen since then. Instant Vortex 2QT Mini Air Fryer for $50 ($10 off) : The budget pick in our guide doesn’t go on sale often — it’s already pretty cheap at its $60 list price. It’s sold for as little as $48 for Prime Day in July, but this is the cheapest we’ve seen since then. Its two-quart capacity is probably best for small kitchens and can crisp up food for one or two people. Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $90 $40 off) : We like this Instant Pot model because it&#39;s simple to use and has several quick-cooking modes including beans, cake, sous vide and more. It went as low as $70 earlier this year, but this is still a 30 percent discount off the list price. Instant Pot Pro Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $138 ($61 off) : We also suggest this fancier Pro Plus model in our guide to kitchen tech . It’s a Wi-Fi connected unit with a canning function and you can even release the steam remotely using the companion app — which has over 800 recipes. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it was $125 earlier this week and dipped as low as $99 for Black Friday last year.&nbsp; Ninja AF150AMZ Air Fryer for $120 (25 percent off) : This went as low as $100 for the holidays last year, but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen since then. The fryer gets an honorable mention in our air fryer guide because it makes good use of limited counter space with its taller design. The round cooking basket doesn’t feel as roomy as square ones but it does have a dehydrate option that other cookers don’t come with. Anova Culinary Sous Vide 3.0 for $129 ($70 off) : We named this the best overall sous vide machine after testing a number of models for our buyer’s guide. This is about $30 more than the low it hit for the holidays last year, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. We appreciate the easy digital controls and found that the high flow rate maintains water temperature better than other machines. Plus, if you’re at a loss for what to cook, you can check out the companion app which is replete with recipes. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $165 ($30 off) : This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. This is the pro model of the version we recommend in our tea guide . KitchenAid Artisan 5-quart stand mixer for $380 ($80 off) : Small wonder that the home cook’s gold standard of mixers made its way onto our kitchen tech guide . Its ton of available attachments can be used to make pasta, grind food, strain or spiralize fruits and veggies and more. This is no unitasker. This is a solid $80 discount off of the MSRP, but we’ll note that Amazon sold it for as low as $330 at the end of last year and for $350 last month. KitchenAid Go Cordless Hand Blender for $100 ($30 off) : The big selling point here is the removable battery that you can use for other KitchenAid Go appliances. In our testing, it had enough power to turn a roasted butternut squash into a smooth, creamy soup. The blender has hit this price a few times over the past few months and the deal isn’t as good as the $77 it sold for at the end of last year.

    "description": "The Amazon Spring Sale has given us a few great deals so far, but anyone looking for affordable earbuds is going to really appreciate this one. Right now, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 earbuds are down to $45 from $80 — a 44 percent discount. That&#39;s an incredible price for earbuds with active noise cancellation.&nbsp; The $45 deal on our favorite budget wireless earbuds is available for the Black and Blue models, while the White, Green and Purple options are slightly more expensive at $50. However, the latter two typically retail for $100 , so they&#39;re actually half off with the current sale.&nbsp; As mentioned above, one of the great things about Anker&#39;s Soundcore Space A40 earbuds is that they offer ANC. Anker claims that using it can reduce potential noise by 98 percent. The earbuds also hold up to 10 hours of battery and up to 50 hours with the charging case. Plus, you can get up to four hours of extra juice with just 10 minutes in the case. The sound quality is also pretty decent, especially for the price.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-deals-include-our-favorite-budget-anker-earbuds-for-45-144520277.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/napster-just-sold-for-207-million-154432315.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The once-iconic music-sharing platform Napster was just purchased for $207 million, with a company called Infinite Reality picking up the tab. What could Napster offer in 2025 to warrant such a price tag? Infinite Reality says it&#39;ll be used as a &quot;social music platform that prioritizes active fan engagement&quot; with a focus on giving artists a platform they can use to connect with listeners and, of course, make more money from them. More specifically, the company plans on creating virtual 3D spaces for music fans to attend concerts and listening parties, in addition to creating a sales platform for musicians and labels to sell merch. This isn’t the worst idea in the world, as attending these kinds of shared events is probably my favorite aspect of VR. It&#39;s not clear what will happen with the existing Napster service; for now, it doesn&#39;t appear it&#39;ll go away immediately. While it offers a similarly massive catalog to what you&#39;ll find on industry leaders Spotify and Apple Music as well as others, the service isn&#39;t really top-of-mind anymore.&nbsp; &quot;The most legendary collab?! Infinite Reality has acquired iconic online music brand @Napster . With this acquisition, we&#39;re expanding and reimagining Napster, empowering artists with new audience monetization and engagement capabilities, underpinned by iR’s #immersive … pic.twitter.com/L4Fig7QFct — Infinite Reality (@Infinite_iR) March 25, 2025 “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” Acunto said. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.” Napster holds numerous licenses to stream millions of songs, which is what made it an attractive prospect to Infinite Reality. The company says its version of Napster will “disrupt legally.” Current Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos says that the purchase will allow artists to create “crazy environments that are really only limited by their imaginations.” As an example, he described a reggae artist who might enjoy a virtual beach environment. Acunto adds that it’ll be like “Clubhouse times a trillion.” He’s referring to the virtual events app that became popular during COVID , but eventually petered out. Infinite Reality has been on a buying spree the last couple of years. In addition to Napster, it purchased the Drone Racing League , the metaverse marketing platform Landvault and the VR shopping platform Obsess . As for Napster, it started in 1999 and took the world by storm, creating an easy-peasy way to steal music. It only took a couple of years for mounting legal battles to catch up to the platform and it declared bankruptcy in 2001. However, that was just the beginning . The software company Roxio purchased the platform in 2002 and relaunched it as a legitimate e-commerce venture that sold digital music files. In 2008, Best Buy came calling and scooped it up. The retail giant only held on to Napster for a few years before selling to Rhapsody in 2011 . Rhapsody tried to make Napster a household name in Europe for the next decade before a consortium of blockchain companies, led by Hivemind and Algorand, bought it in 2022 . These companies had plans to do some kind of NFT-based nonsense, because “music x web3 is one of the most exciting spaces.” That didn’t work and, well, here we are. Here’s to another 25 years of being passed around like a hot potato. Update, March 26 2025, 10:43AM ET: This story was updated with more details about Infinite Reality&#39;s plans for Napster.

    "description": "As someone who paid full price for Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM5 headphones , I am jealous to report that they are 20 percent off right now as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . Yes, our choice for 2025&#39;s best wireless headphones have dropped to $318 from $400 — a 20 percent discount. They briefly dropped to $250 earlier in the sale, but have since jumped back up a bit. Nevertheless, this is a good sale price overall; you can grab them on discount in either the silver of smoky pink colors. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones are one of them. I&#39;ve raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they&#39;re so comfortable. I&#39;ve worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp; Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they&#39;re a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don&#39;t have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp; Their excellence on flights isn&#39;t the only reason we gave Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones a 95 in our review . They&#39;re also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound&#39;s quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don&#39;t fold up, but especially at this price, they&#39;re still such a great buy.&nbsp; This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don&#39;t quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

    "description": "Microsoft has launched two new &quot;reasoning agents&quot; for Copilot that were designed to analyze vast amounts of work data, including emails, meetings, chats and documents. The first tool called &quot;Researcher&quot; is based on OpenAI&#39;s deep research model combined with Copilot&#39;s advanced orchestration and deep search capabilities. Researcher was made for &quot;complex, multi-step research&quot; at work. It can take a user&#39;s internal work data along with additional information from the web, such as competitive data, emerging trends and the latest market analysis, to create market strategies and comprehensive quarterly reports, among other potential uses. Plus, it can pull data from Salesforce, ServiceNow and other external sources. Meanwhile, the new &quot;Analyst&quot; tool was built to function like a skilled data scientist. It&#39;s based on OpenAI&#39;s o3-mini reasoning model and uses &quot;chain-of-thought reasoning&quot; to solve issues in multiple steps to provide answers that Microsoft says &quot;mirror human analytical thinking.&quot; It can process raw data across multiple spreadsheets to, say, predict future revenue and expenses, forecast demand for a new product and visualize the purchasing patterns of customers. For the most complex data queries, it can run Python, and users will be able to view the code while it&#39;s running in real time.&nbsp; Both Researcher and Analyst will be rolling out to customers with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license starting in April as part of &quot;Frontier.&quot; Customers enrolled to the new Frontier program will get access to Copilot technologies while they&#39;re still in development, starting with these two new tools.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-deep-research-and-analysis-tools-for-copilot-143001894.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals: Save up to $200 on AirPods, iPads and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-apple-deals-save-up-to-200-on-airpods-ipads-and-more-092050968.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is into its second day, and though the event is nowhere near as heavy on tech as Black Friday or Prime Day, we’ve still managed to find a few noteworthy discounts on Apple devices. If you’re in the market for a new iPad, Apple Watch or pair of AirPods, we’ve rounded up the best Apple deals going on right now. In truth, most of the offers below aren’t tied to the Spring Sale specifically, but they still drop a number of Apple (and Beats) gadgets we recommend to lower prices than usual. As a refresher, Amazon says this sale will run through March 31, and the deals we&#39;ve dug up below aren&#39;t exclusive to Prime members. Best Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $149 ($30 off MSRP) : This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple’s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn’t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a score of 86 in our review. This discount is $11 higher than the best price we’ve seen, but it’s about as low as the earbuds have fallen outside of that. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. Also at Best Buy . The Apple Watch Series 10. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off) : The top pick in our guide to the best smartwatches , the Series 10 is a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer profile and a marginally larger display compared to the previous Series 9. That said, it remains a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. It should be a welcome upgrade if you’re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch (think pre-Series 7) — just keep in mind a patent dispute has locked it out the blood oxygen detection features found on those older models. This $100 discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the non-cellular model with a 42mm case. Also at Best Buy and Walmart . Apple iPad (A16) for $329 ($20 off) : The newest entry-level iPad only arrived three weeks ago, but Amazon is currently selling it for $20 less than Apple direct, which is a decent little savings if you planned on grabbing the tablet early anyway. This one is another small update, but it now comes with a faster A16 chip, more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for media consumption and lighter work, it&#39;s still a fine value. Also at B&amp;H and Best Buy . Apple iPad Air 11-inch (M3) for $549 ($50 off) : Much like the deal on the base iPad above, this isn’t a huge discount, but it’s a nice chance to save a few bucks compared to buying from Apple directly. The new iPad Air was released on the same day as the iPad (A16) and is a similarly minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still prefer the Air over the base model if you can swing it: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. The older M2-powered model is an even better value if you can find it on sale, but either way the Air is the iPad we recommend to most people. Also at B&amp;H , Best Buy and Walmart . The 13-inch iPad Air M3. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $738 ($61 off) : We gave the 13-inch iPad Air a review score of 89 earlier this month. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 128GB model. Also at Walmart . Apple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off) : The iPad Pro is more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being how expensive it all is. This deal on doesn’t truly lessen that — and it’s another deal we’ve seen multiple times in recent months — but it still ties the 13-inch model’s all-time low.

    "title": "Noble Audio FoKus Apollo review: The high price of pristine audio",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html?src=rss",
    "description": "I don’t review a lot of $650 headphones . That’s because most audio companies sell their top-of-the-line gear around $300-$400. Noble Audio isn’t like most companies. The FoKus Rex5 earbuds, for example, cram in five separate drivers where much of the competition uses two at the most. Noble was also among the first to employ xMEMS drivers in wireless earbuds in a bid to improve bass performance. Enter the FoKus Apollo , a $649 pair of active noise canceling (ANC) headphones with a detachable boom mic and up to 80 hours of battery life. The real star of the show is the driver setup , which Noble says is the first time this configuration appears in wireless headphones. The company is once again on a quest for the absolute best sound quality, but it may sacrifice a little too much along the way. Sound quality is the main attraction Noble Audio’s proposition is simple: the “world’s first” headphones that offer a hybrid speaker pairing of a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar magnetic driver. A dynamic driver is nothing new for a set of cans, but adding the latter makes the FoKus Apollo’s audio setup unique. For the uninitiated, planar magnetic drivers have a thin, flat diaphragm that typically offers a wider, more immersive soundstage and enhanced detail compared to dynamic drivers. Planar magnetic drivers are typically reserved for audiophile-grade headphones since they’re larger and more fragile. With the FoKus Apollo, Noble capitalized on the best of both worlds for the stock tuning. You get the bass power of a dynamic driver with the clarity of a planar magnetic driver. Since planar magnetic units can’t move enough air for the robust bass that most of us crave, and as dynamic drivers are limited with mid- and high-range details, the company argues it has created the optimal solution. From the first second of the first song, I could tell the FoKus Apollo was built differently. The addition of planar magnetic drivers offers the most bass-heavy genres an almost absurd amount of detail. Albums like Spiritbox’s Tsunami Sea that lack clarity on other headphones greatly benefit from the treble boost, serving up more nuance in the guitar riffs and texture in the kick drum blasts. The FoKus Apollo also excels with mellow styles, allowing you to hear every bit of sound coming from the acoustic guitars, banjo, bass and more on Julien Baker &amp; TORRES’ “Sugar in the Tank.” Going from most over-ear headphones to the FoKus Apollo is like going from standard music streaming to vinyl. And I don’t think that’s hyperbole. FoKus Apollo in-use: ANC, battery life and more Billy Steele for Engadget A pair of $649 ANC headphones better damn well provide some decent noise cancellation, even if you’re primarily buying them for the audio performance. Noble opted for a hybrid ANC setup with three microphones on each side and a Qualcomm QCC3084 chip. That processor provides the necessary digital signal processing (DSP) and algorithms to reduce background distractions. Like a lot of ANC headphones, the FoKus Apollo struggles with voices. That means any hopes of silencing a chatty colleague won’t pan out. However, the headphones do a solid job with constant noise sources — fans, appliances, noise machines, etc. — so they do offer some relief. The noise-blocking prowess isn’t as good as the likes of Bose , but I found ample room to focus during my test sessions. While the ANC here isn’t among the best, it’s perfectly serviceable in most environments. Noble promises a whopping 60 hours of battery life with ANC enabled, with another 20 hours of use if you turn it off. I found that those figures hold true during my time with the FoKus Apollo. After 30 hours of music, podcasts and work calls with noise cancellation active, the headphones still had 57 percent battery remaining — tracking slightly better than the company’s stated numbers. The Fokus Apollo comes with all the accessories you’d ever need right in the box. Noble includes a detachable boom mic, 3.5mm to 4.4mm adapter, two-prong airline adapter, USB-C cable and 3.5mm aux cable. The headphones can be used with either of those two cords, and the company recommends you do so when employing the microphone for optimal voice quality. If you’re planning to use the Fokus Apollo for calls, you can expect mixed results. In quiet spaces with little echo, you’ll sound good enough for a professional presentation. When you move to a room with some natural reverb, the mics on these headphones pick that up a little too well. What’s more, they’re not great at blocking background sounds, as fans, white noise machines and raucous appliances were all clearly heard on the other end during my tests. Design that matches the sound The FoKus Apollo is really expensive, so Noble couldn’t just give us a set of headphones built mostly out of plastic and call it a day. Thankfully, the company chose a mix of anodized aluminum, premium protein leather and a soft Alcantara headband. The leather-wrapped memory foam ear pads are replaceable, which will extend the life of the headphones under heavy use. There’s also a nice textured cloth pattern on the outside of the ear cups and headband that provide both tactile and visual contrast. Noble Audio provides physical controls on the FoKus Apollo, so you’ll never have to struggle with tap or touch gestures to make changes. On the right side, there’s a dedicated button for ANC modes (on, off and transparency) with a three-control array just below it. Here, the top and bottom buttons handle the volume and track adjustments while the center one is used for power, Bluetooth pairing, play/pause and to summon Google Assistant, Siri or some other virtual helper. On the left ear cup, a single slider allows you to mute all the microphones, even the boom when it’s attached, without reaching for your phone or keyboard. The lack of advanced features Billy Steele for Engadget The FoKus Apollo is really only focused on the basics, so it doesn’t offer any of today’s advanced features. Heck, there aren’t even tools that have been on other sets for years — like wear detection. Although you’ll get support for Sony’s LDAC codec along with AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC, there’s no mention of Dolby Atmos or any form of spatial audio. You don’t find any discussion of adaptive audio or adaptive ANC that makes automatic adjustments to both overall sound and noise cancellation either. Look, I’m well aware the premise here is pristine sound quality above all else. But at $649, which is $100 more than the AirPods Max by the way, I expect some degree of convenience that allows me to keep these headphones on for most of the day. Automatic pausing or wear detection should be standard at this price and it would be nice to have some additional sound/ANC options. I’m not picky about whether those are the automatic, adaptive type, or whether they’re settings I have to toggle on in the app. Just, please, give me something more than EQ adjustments when your sound out of the box is already incredible. The competition Once you hit $500 and above, you’ve surpassed what most companies charge for their flagship-level wireless headphones. You’re also in a price range where I’ve only reviewed a handful of models. If money is no object, the $699 Px8 from Bowers &amp; Wilkins delivers excellent sound quality in a design that might be preferable to some folks (there’s at least multiple color options). Its ANC performance isn’t earth shattering either, and one of my biggest gripes with the company’s products is the lack of advanced features like the FoKus Apollo. There’s also the AirPods Max and Dyson On-Trac , but neither of those are easy to recommend. Apple’s over-ear headphones have barely been updated since they arrived in 2020, except for an upgrade to USB-C and the upcoming addition of lossless audio . Dyson’s headphones have long battery life and a unique design, but they didn’t impress me sound-wise, have average ANC performance and lack the modern features I expect for $500. I also need to mention Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW75 in the over-$500 discussion. If you’re after high-end looks, no other company consistently nails its trademark aesthetic like M&amp;D. True to its lineage, the company pairs leather and metal on these headphones, along with tempered glass panels on the outside of the earcups. I’ve always enjoyed the balance of M&amp;D’s stock tuning and the ANC performance is solid. You won’t get any advanced features here either, but like the Px8, there are multiple color options if you’re after something other than Noble’s black and silver paint scheme. Wrap-up I have no doubts there are a lot of people that will thoroughly enjoy the FoKus Apollo . If you crave the absolute best sound quality on the market, these headphones are the best I’ve tested in that regard. For me, to pay $649 I expect more in terms of features. The first item would be better ANC performance, but I don’t feel like spatial audio support and wear detection are too much to ask. Even without any of that, you do get a novel driver setup that produces some ridiculously detailed sound across diverse genres.

    "description": "If you&#39;ve been contemplating an E Ink tablet, one of our top picks has received a good discount thanks to Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . The second-gen Kindle Scribe is on sale for $325, down from $399 — that&#39;s a 19 percent discount. Digital notebooks like the Scribe can give you the convenience of a connected device with the old-school feel of writing with pen and paper. The new Amazon Kindle Scribe received an 86 in our review thanks to its nice design, AI enhancements and excellent reading and writing experience. It also comes with a Premium Pen that has a rubberized top to symbolize an eraser. Our biggest quip was its cost, but that&#39;s somewhat less concerning thanks to this discount. The Scribe isn&#39;t the only Kindle discounted for the Amazon Spring Sale. You can grab the Kindle Colorsoft for $225 right now, which is 20 percent off its usual going rate. If you&#39;ve been keen on getting a Kindle with a color display so you can better read comics, manga and the like, the Colorsoft is your only option. We enjoyed the colors that the screen can produce, plus its a zippy ereader a handy auto-adjusting front light and a solid 32GB of storage.

    "description": "It&#39;s day two of Amazon&#39;s Big Spring Sale , and while the week-long event is mostly focused on categories like apparel and outdoor goods, it still includes a handful of discounts on electronics. Per usual with these big Amazon events, most of those aren’t anything special. But if you’re on a budget and looking to grab a new gadget on the cheap, we’ve checked price histories and dug up a few actually decent tech deals that are priced below $50. Some of the discounts have technically been available for a few days, but the offers include several devices we recommend in our various buying guides . Note that the sale will run through March 31, and that you don&#39;t need to be a Prime member to access any of the offers below.&nbsp; Best Amazon Spring Sale deals under $50 Anker PowerConf C200 for $48 ($12 off MSRP) : The PowerConf C200 is our favorite webcam for those on a tighter budget due to its crisp video quality, easy setup, solid microphones and built-in privacy cover. Its USB cable is on the shorter side, and it can’t match the overall accuracy of our top pick, but it’s still a clear upgrade over a built-in laptop camera for a much lower price. This is another deal we’ve seen numerous times in the last year, but it’s as low as the camera usually goes. Also at Anker . Anker 525 Charging Station for $30 ($36 off) : We recommend this reliable desktop charging station in our remote worker gift guide . It can’t provide the absolute fastest charge to your smartphone or laptop (topping out at a quick enough 67W), but it packs four USB ports — two USB-C, two USB-A — and three AC outlets in a frame that’s small enough to fit on a crowded desk. This deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . The Anker 525 Charging Station. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anker Nano Charger 30W for $13 ($10 off) : It’s hard to have too many portable wall chargers on standby. This one from Anker should be particularly useful for traveling: At just over an inch thick, it’s small enough to fit in a pocket, while its 30W USB-C port is enough to top up recent iPhones at full speed. (That’s not enough for some newer Android phones , though.) This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . Amazon Music Unlimited 3-month trial for free ($24 off) : Amazon is offering new subscribers three months of its Music Unlimited streaming service for free. Normally, it gives new users a one-month trial. Though Music Unlimited isn’t a top pick in our guide to the best music services , it still gets you lossless streaming quality and an extensive library of both music and podcasts. You could do worse if you just want to bum a few months of music streaming for no cost. Just note that your subscription will auto-renew once the trial period ends until you cancel. The Blink Mini 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Blink Mini 2 for $20 ($20 off) : This deal ties the lowest price to date for the Blink Mini 2, which is the budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras . This one comes with its share of trade-offs for the low price — its image quality isn’t the best, it locks certain features behind a paywall and it won’t automatically arm when you leave the house — but it still provides functional 1080p video, color night vision, motion alerts and Alexa support in a weather-resistant frame. It’s fairly simple to set up, too, though you’ll need to buy an external module if you want to store clips locally. Also at Best Buy , Lowe&#39;s and The Home Depot . Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Unlike the AirTag, it can also attach directly to a keychain. It probably isn’t the safest choice for long-distance travel, but it’s a convenient security blanket if you, say, leave your keys or wallet behind at a restaurant. This is another discount that’s been available for a few weeks, but it’s just 10 cents more the best price we’ve seen.

    "description": "Anker power banks and other charging gear have been discounted thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . Noteworthy among the deals is this Anker 321 MagGo power bank that&#39;s going for only $20 for Prime members. The discount applies to all colorways, too, including white, black, pink, green and purple. Anker devices are some of our favorites and a few of them have made it onto our list of the best power banks and portable chargers. This particular model on sale is MagSafe-compatible, so it will magnetically attach to the back of your iPhone when you need a power-up. It&#39;s also compatible with MagSafe iPhone cases, too. Inside, there’s a 5,000mAh battery that provides up to 19 hours of additional use for modern iPhones. It’s equipped with heat sensors that continuously monitor temperatures to avoid accidental damage and it can juice up a phone while it’s being charged itself. This power bank is also on the smaller side, so it easily fits into pockets, bags and purses. The only downside is that this is only for Prime members. However, the Anker Nano 3-in-1 portable charger is on sale for everyone. This non-magnetic charger includes a large 10,000mAh battery and is currently $35 . Even some of Anker&#39;s latest power banks and chargers that it debuted at CES have discounts as part of the Spring Sale as well.

    "description": "This year’s Amazon Spring Sale is in full swing, and as promised, a ton of household, fashion and outdoor gear has dropped to record-low prices. Tech isn’t a huge focus for this sale, but there are a decent number of devices on sale right now for some of the best prices we’ve seen all year. The selection may not be as good as that of Amazon Prime Day in July, but it still provides a good opportunity to save on things like headphones, robot vacuums, air purifiers and more. We’ve collected the best Amazon Spring Sale deals on tech gear here so you don’t have to go searching for them. The Spring Sale runs through March 31, so check back here for all of the latest deals as they drop. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals 10th-gen iPad for $269 (23 percent off): The previous version of most affordable iPad gives you an A14 Bionic chip, a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, TouchID built into the lock button and more. It’s compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the keyboard folio, plus we found it to have solid performance and a matching battery life. Dyson AM09 heater and fan for $300 (36 percent off): The AM09 has been around for ages, and for good reason. It&#39;s an excellent heater during cold months and fan during warm months, so you can use it all year round. Jet Focus control lets you choose from Focused or Diffused for personal or whole-room heating or cooling, and the handy sleep timer lets you set when the device turns off in intervals from 15 minutes up to nine hours. Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $318 (20 percent off): These top our list of the best wireless headphones you can get right now thanks to their supreme comfort, excellent sound quality and ANC, multipoint connectivity and 30-hour battery life. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. A quick-charge feature will net you 2.5 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging, so you&#39;ll rarely have to go without them, too. Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones for $349 ($80 off): These hold the top spot in our best wireless headphones guide for excellent noise cancellation. These cans will give you a step up in ANC, blocking out most noise and chatter of those around you. General audio quality has been improved as well, and they have a comfy fit. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off): A version of one of our favorite air fryers , this air fryer toaster oven has 11 cooking modes including air fry, broil, bake, roast and more, and it has a large capacity that can fit up to six slices of bread at once or a 13-inch pizza. The Pro model is also on sale, down to $320 from $400. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off): This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $20 (43 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget streaming device can play content at 1080p/60fps and now its remote can also control your TV&#39;s power and volume. There&#39;s also Alexa support built into the remote, so you can use voice commands to search for content. Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $169 ($80 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you&#39;re on the market for a new desktop, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Beats Studio Pro for $180 (49 percent off): These Beats headphones have improved sound quality, good Transparency mode and USB-C charging, plus decent mic quality for phone calls. They support wired USB-C audio, plus they have solid ANC as well. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Blink Mini 2 for $20 (50 percent off): Blink&#39;s latest wired, indoor security camera is one of our favorites , particularly if you&#39;re just starting out building a security camera system. It&#39;s easy to set up and use, and it works seamlessly with Amazon&#39;s Alexa. Plus, if you want a local storage option, you can buy the Blink Sync Module 2 and a thumb drive to store video clips locally. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 ($30 off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. Levoit Core 400S air purifier for $190 ($30 off with coupon): Our top pick for the best air purifier for most people, the Core 400S has easy-to-use onboard controls, powerful filtering technology that isn&#39;t too loud and relatively affordable replacement filters. It reliably improved air quality in our testing, and even though its mobile app is a little overstuffed, it gives you another way to control and monitor the device. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "description": "No Man’s Sky already lets players dig deep into the terrain of its near-infinite universe of planets, but now there will actually be cool stuff to find. Hello Games just announced general availability of a new update called Relics that brings a bit of Indiana Jones to everyone’s favorite space exploration sim. The update lets players &quot;feel like true paleontologists&quot; as they dig up the “skeletal remains of alien creatures.” When bones are discovered, folks can piece them together to match their own design aspirations. The game will also allow players to create museums and share collections with other players. Hello Games Hello Games boasts that there is a &quot;truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes.&quot; There’s a rarity system in place, with the most uncommon finds holding a &quot;huge value.&quot; If digging gets a bit tiresome, the developer has placed a fossil specialist at space stations that can be bartered with. However, digging up bones comes with a major risk, as &quot;things have been buried for a reason.&quot; Some of the rarest items are guarded by dangerous creatures like Stone Ghosts, the colossal Stone Golem and something called a Titan Worm. Fun times. This is just the latest gameplay update for No Man’s Sk y. Recent updates have added new planets and stars , freighter combat and black holes . Relics is available for PCs, consoles and VR.

    "description": "The last few years have seen an ongoing debate over what rights AI companies have to utilize copyrighted material . The latest development tips the scales in favor of use: A judge has rejected Universal Music Group, ABKCO and other music publishers&#39; preliminary bid to block Anthropic from using their lyrics to train its AI assistant Claude, Reuters reports .&nbsp; US District Judge Eumi Lee ruled that UMG and co had submitted too broad a request and failed to demonstrate that Anthropic&#39;s use of the lyrics caused the companies &quot;irreparable harm.&quot; Lee stated, &quot;Publishers are essentially asking the Court to define the contours of a licensing market for AI training where the threshold question of fair use remains unsettled.&quot; The case dates back to 2023, when UMG joined some of its fellow music publishers in suing Anthropic for copyright infringement. They claimed that Anthropic used and distributed copyrighted material, including at least 500 songs. &quot;Anthropic’s copyright infringement is not innovation; in layman’s terms, it’s theft,&quot; UMG stated at the time.&nbsp; The two sides came to a partial agreement in January of this year. Anthropic confirmed it would maintain current guardrails for reproducing, displaying or distributing copyrighted material.

    "title": "iPad (2025) with A16 review: No Apple Intelligence, no problem",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html?src=rss",
    "description": "When it debuted in 2022, Apple’s 10th-generation iPad sat in something of a no-man’s land, bringing a long-overdue design revamp at an inflated price. A year and a half later, Apple gave the slate a $100 price cut and immediately turned it into a much more enticing value . Now, the company has quietly released a follow-up. Dubbed the iPad (A16) , the new tablet is a far less dramatic update, one with welcome performance improvements that otherwise refuses to rock the boat. It even lacks the Apple Intelligence features Apple has endlessly promoted over the past year. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Compared to the iPad Air, iPad Pro and iPad mini, this might be the easiest Apple tablet to grok — it’s the cheapest, it only comes in one size and it’s clearly designed for the core iPad Things. That doesn’t make it a slam dunk, though. What hasn’t changed Almost everything about the latest iPad is identical to the previous entry-level iPad from 2022, which brought many of the iPad Air’s features down to a lower price. The design is unchanged, with the same dimensions, weight, bezels, display and aluminum finish as before. Apple now lists the screen as being 11 inches instead of 10.9 inches, but it’s merely rounding up for marketing purposes — the size is no different. There are still competent 12-megapixel cameras on the front and back, with the selfie cam conveniently located along the device’s long edge for FaceTime calls. The same reliable Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the power button in lieu of Face ID. Two speakers, one on either end, sit behind a (misleading) quartet of grilles, while a lone USB-C port continues to max out at basic USB 2.0 transfer speeds. There’s no difference in accessory support either, and the whole thing is available in the same bold colors: blue, pink, yellow or silver. Battery life, meanwhile, still checks in at around 10 hours per charge, give or take a few depending on how you push it. I got 11 hours and 19 minutes out of the slate after playing a 1080p movie on loop at roughly 70 percent brightness and volume (and with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth disabled). Gaming and media editing will naturally sap it faster. Most of this is still perfectly fine for a $349 tablet. The last iPad was a light and comfortable slab, with a substantial aluminum finish and flat sides that made it feel modern. This one is no different. And iPadOS is still a level above Android and Windows tablets when it comes to app and game support, long-term updates and features optimized for large displays. But if the 10th-gen iPad was a “tick” update, the iPad (A16) is clearly a “tock.” That said, there are some important changes, namely a faster chip, more memory and higher storage options, plus a few minor tweaks like Smart HDR 4 processing for photos and support for Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.2. It’s a spec bump through and through, with most of those tweaks being for the better, although I do think that some of the things that haven’t been touched could really use an update next time. A faster chip and more RAM As the name implies, the latest iPad’s headline upgrade is its A16 chip. This is a slightly weaker version of the A16 Bionic found in 2022’s iPhone 14 Pro and the regular iPhone 15 from 2023. Compared to that SoC, this A16 has five CPU cores instead of six and four GPU cores instead of five. But in practice, it’s still more than fast enough for the vast majority of things people do with iPads: browsing the web, streaming video, reading ebooks, viewing and editing photos, playing most games and the like. I tested this iPad against my personal 13-inch iPad Air M2 for much of this review, and the two consistently booted up and loaded popular apps at virtually the same speed. The few times the Air M2 was quicker, the difference wasn’t long enough to be significant. Geekbench 6 results back this up: The iPad (A16) earned a single-core CPU score of 2,582, while the iPad Air M2 was only marginally better at 2,632. This is a roughly 20 percent jump from the 10th-gen iPad, though the most recent iPad Air M3 still measures about 16-18 percent faster. But for media consumption and common work tasks, it won’t feel slow anytime soon. These performance gains are helped by the 6GB of RAM, which is 2GB more than the last model and twice as much as the 9th-gen iPad from 2021. While this is still 2GB short of the iPad Air and lower-spec iPad Pros, getting more memory for the same price is always a good thing: It lets the tablet hang onto apps and Safari tabs longer before it has to start refreshing things for new tasks. It will only improve the chances of the device holding up four or five years down the road, too. Where the iPad (A16) lags behind its higher-end siblings is multi-core and graphics performance. In Geekbench 6, the tablet’s multi-core CPU score was about 40 percent below the iPad Air M2 (6,185 vs. 10,006), while its GPU score was about 55 percent worse (19,448 vs. 42,920). Other graphics benchmarks were largely the same: It scored about 60 percent lower than the Air M2 in 3DMark’s Wild Life Extreme test (with an average of 15.2 fps vs. 37.6 fps) and anywhere between 45 to 55 percent worse on GFXBench ’s Aztec Ruins benchmark, depending on the resolution. Of course, the difference will be a little greater with the newer iPad Air M3. This sounds more dramatic on paper than it does in real life. Many everyday iPad workloads won’t tax the chip’s multi-core abilities all that hard, and the scores above are still a good 15 to 30 percent higher than the last entry-level iPad. I could still play Call of Duty Mobile at its highest settings (120 fps mode aside) without any hitches. Diablo Immortal warned that maxing out its settings would put the device under “high” load — with the Air M2, it only goes up to “medium” load — but I still got through the opening areas totally fine. (It does seem to drain the battery a bit faster, though.) You can still edit RAW photos in Lightroom or create music in GarageBand without major frustration. The iPad (A16) on top of a 13-inch iPad Air. Still, the Air is better if you ever want to push things further. This is easiest to see in the newest and most taxing iPadOS games. With Infinity Nikki , for instance, playing at ultra or high settings on the new iPad brought a constant bit of choppiness and some slowdowns during more involved animations. It also warmed up the device’s back and drained the battery faster. The game was still totally playable at medium settings, but there’s less need to knock it down on the iPad Air M2, where it looked sharper and ran smoother at high settings. Likewise, the Air will be noticeably quicker to export higher-res videos in apps like Adobe Premiere Rush. Arguably, the main benefit of the iPad Air’s M-series chip and extra RAM has less to do with today than it does the future. Features like Apple Intelligence and the Stage Manager multitasking mode aren’t available here, nor are some especially demanding games . Those aren’t essential right now — though omitting Stage Manager does make the device more cumbersome to use with an external display — but there’ll always be some risk that the next great iPadOS feature or power-hungry game won’t work (or work as well ) with this entry-level model. More storage — hallelujah The best improvement with the iPad (A16) is also the simplest: It now starts with 128GB of storage, which is twice as much as the last model. There’s also a new 512GB option for $649. There isn’t much to say about this besides “good.” It’s a common-sense upgrade that makes the tablet a much safer long-term investment than its predecessor, especially when there’s no hope of Apple ever letting us upgrade storage manually. A fine display, but it’s time to improve In his iPad Air M3 review , my colleague Nathan Ingraham argued that it’s time for Apple to update the Air’s display with a higher refresh rate or a mini LED panel , as the OLED tech exclusive to the iPad Pros represents a major upgrade on its own. Since the iPad (A16)’s screen is no different than the last one, I want to make a follow-up case for the entry-level model, albeit on a smaller scale. It&#39;s much easier to see in person than through photos, but if you look at the bottom corner of the display, near the bezel, you can see the air gap between the iPad&#39;s LCD panel and front glass. Out of context, the IPS display here is still totally adequate. It’s comfortably sized, it’s sharp enough, it’s not a massive smudge magnet and it doesn’t have any serious color accuracy issues. A tablet is nothing if not a big display, and most of the people Apple is targeting with this one will still enjoy watching and reading stuff on it. I can also live with the 60Hz refresh rate — that’s the minimum in 2025, but it’s a harsher limitation on a $599 ( or $799 ) tablet like the iPad Air than a $349 device. The other restrictions are more annoying. This screen still isn’t laminated, most notably, which means there’s a visible air gap between the LCD panel and the glass above. This helps the screen’s repairability but makes it look cheaper and feel more distant when you interact with the glass. This is particularly discernible with the Apple Pencil: Writing out notes on the iPad Air is both quieter and more natural. Those who’ve never used a higher-end iPad probably won’t care, but once you notice the difference, you can’t unsee it. The display also lacks an anti-reflective coating, so it’s worse at fending off glare. It’s certainly not unusable outdoors, but you’ll see your reflection much more clearly on the iPad (A16) than you will on the iPad Air M2 in sunlight. You’re much more likely to have to angle its display to make things out. Unlike the iPad Air and iPad Pro, the base iPad isn’t tuned for the wider P3 color space either. While the difference in color reproduction between the iPad Air and iPad (A16) is nowhere near as dramatic as the one between the Air and the iPad Pro, colors on the Air can still look slightly bolder and less washed-out when you put the two side-by-side. I appreciate that Apple wants to keep its “good, better, best” hierarchy intact, but at this point the iPad Pro’s display is so far ahead of the rest of the lineup that there’s room to even things out. If the next Air can upgrade to 120Hz, as Nathan suggests, then the next entry-level iPad should at least have a laminated display with better glare protection. Those aren’t premium features anymore. The USB-C Pencil can attach magnetically but lacks wireless charging and pressure sensitivity, so it&#39;s not a great choice for more involved work. Continued weirdness with accessories Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard support is another ongoing pain point. Like its predecessor, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with the Pencil Pro (Apple’s best stylus) or the older, second-gen Pencil. That means the only stylus you can buy with pressure sensitivity — a key feature for digital artists that lets you make darker marks by pressing down harder — is the original Pencil, which is nearly a decade old (!), isn’t as comfortable as the newer models and can’t attach to the tablet magnetically. It also requires a USB-C cable and a USB-C to Lightning adapter to charge. All of this is bad . You can still get the $79 USB-C Pencil , which is nicer to hold and can attach to the iPad’s side magnetically but isn’t pressure-sensitive and still requires a separate cable to pair and charge. Really, though, most people who want an iPad for drawing should start with the iPad Air. I’ve never been a big fan of this iPad’s Magic Keyboard Folio either, as its Surface-style kickstand is hard to keep stable on your lap and it lacks backlit keys. That’s tough given its exorbitantly high price of $249. Not built for Apple Intelligence, but that’s OK (for now) As noted above, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with Apple Intelligence, which is Apple’s catch-all term for the suite of generative AI features it’s gradually rolled out since late last year. In fact, it’s the only major device Apple has released without the AI tools since they became available. Right now, though, you won’t miss much without them. Sure, the “ Clean Up ” feature that lets you scrub unwanted objects from photos is nice. Some of the writing-assistance tools are fine if you’re completely out of gas, and being able to access ChatGPT through Siri is convenient. But just as many of the tricks are either half-cooked or, let’s say, less than essential . A promised Siri revamp has been significantly delayed . If anything, many people will appreciate that their tablet won’t push AI onto them with every update. There’s always a chance Apple Intelligence becomes more useful down the road, and buying the iPad (A16) means locking yourself out of that potential future. But it’s not there yet , and Apple is reportedly well aware of that, so we can’t call it a major omission today. Wrap-up The iPad (A16) isn’t a massive leap forward from the last entry-level iPad, and some of its display and accessory quirks are getting long in the tooth. We still recommend stepping up to the iPad Air if you can swing it: It’s faster and more futureproof, with small but meaningful upgrades to the screen, better accessory support and speakers that sound less compressed. It’s also worth the upgrade if you want to use your iPad as a pseudo laptop replacement without spending top dollar. If you see a great deal on refurbished iPad Air M2 , that’s a good buy as well. But for $250 less than the latest Air, the iPad (A16) does well to meet most iPad users where they live. It’s largely well-built and plenty quick for reading, watching and playing things, with solid battery life and an eternally easy-to-use OS. If you’re upgrading from a 9th-gen iPad or older, buying for a kid or just looking for a competent slate you won’t use for hours every day, it should be plenty of tablet for your needs. It’s not the most delightful iPad, but it’s good enough for the masses.

    "description": "Block has laid off 931 workers, which make up around eight percent of its entire staff, according to TechCrunch and The Guardian . The publications have viewed an email, wherein the financial technology company&#39;s co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, has discussed the latest organizational changes. Dorsey said that Block is eliminating roles based on three areas, starting with strategy. The company is letting 391 people go, because it&#39;s reducing &quot;teams that are off strategy.&quot; It&#39;s also parting ways with 460 workers who scored a &quot;below&quot; rating or are trending towards a &quot;below&quot; rating in its internal performance tracking metrics. Finally, Block is laying off 80 managers, as well as moving 193 to individual contributor roles, to flatten the organization and remove layers of middle management between workers and the high-level bosses they&#39;d now have to report to. In his email, Dorsey denied that the layoffs were made to hit any specific financial target and headcount goal, or because the company was replacing workers with artificial intelligence. He said that it was all about strategy and because flattening its org will allow it to &quot;move faster and with less abstraction.&quot; The CEO admitted, however, that everyone in Block has equity in the company and that the reorganization &quot;will help [it] focus and execute better to do just that.&quot; Block&#39;s stock prices have plummeted by around 30 percent this year.&nbsp; Dorsey explained that the company is laying off nearly 1,000 workers all at once instead of over time, because it&#39;s behind in its actions. &quot;We need to move to help us meet and stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in,&quot; he wrote. In addition to the layoffs, Block is also closing 748 previously open jobs and is only leaving key leadership and critical roles, along with those that have already progressed to offer stage, open. Block, which owns Square and Cash App, also underwent a reorganization in early 2024. It laid off nearly 1,000 people back then, as well, to make the company leaner and to limit its headcount to around 12,000 workers. As TechCrunch notes, Block had around 11,300 workers around the world by December 2024, which means its headcount is now far below the original goal it set for itself in 2023.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/block-reportedly-lays-off-almost-1000-employees-130056952.html?src=rss",

    "description": "A day without a company announcing some new way AI can supposedly make our lives better is rare. Today it&#39;s Amazon, which has announced a new AI-powered feature called &quot;Interests.&quot; It lets you enter personalized shopping prompts based on your, well, interests and price limits — and it arrives just in time for Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale .&nbsp; Interests can handle prompts with everyday language, like &quot;Brewing tools and gadgets for coffee lovers&quot; or &quot;Natural makeup products for summer glow from top brands.&quot; The AI-powered feature will then look through Amazon&#39;s store to see current offerings and send you notifications about any deals, new products or restocks that are relevant to your prompt. Shopping on Amazon can sometimes feel like a never-ending pit of decent enough options, so hopefully this feature provides a more tailored selection.&nbsp; Amazon has only released Interests to a small group of customers in the US and only through the app or mobile website.

    "title": "The best language learning apps for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-language-learning-app-120001600.html?src=rss",
    "description": "There’s a good chance learning a new language is one of your New Year’s resolutions, unless you’re hoping Google Translate will be enough for your next international adventure. Either way, you’ll need a reliable method to guide you through speaking and understanding the foreign language of your choosing. Fortunately, we're no longer confined to flashcards and textbooks as you can learn using your phone from the comfort of your couch. Many of the best language learning apps today offer a multi-tier approach, with AI-powered conversations, extensive vocab libraries and even podcasts you can listen to to help you master your target language. Whether you're just starting because you're just trying to understand what Bad Bunny means when he says \"un verano en Nueva Yol ,\" or you want to brush up on your Korean before that planned vacation, there’s a language learning app to suit your needs. Best language learning apps for 2025 Others language learning apps we tested Memrise Memrise has a library of more than 200 languages to learn. From Spanish to isiXhosa, Memrise can teach you all the basics and dive into more regional differences. As a Spanish learner, I could choose to learn from Spain or Mexico and I enjoyed that Memrise didn’t just teach me a more generalized version of the language. While Memrise could be great for polyglots, its hefty $60 monthly fee was too steep and prevented it from gleaning one of our top slots. Pimsleur Dr. Pimsleur believed speaking and listening were key to learning a new language. This app allows you to take its audio lessons offline, even going as far as integrating into Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. As a commuter, I appreciated having a lesson or two stored away for my journey to the office. However, I wanted more ways to practice reading and writing. With other apps offering podcasts for listening along and other forms of teaching, Pimsleur didn’t offer enough to make our list. Rosetta Stone Gone are the large, yellow disc sets of yesteryear; now Rosetta Stone lives squarely in the digital age with its app. Using the same visual learning tools as the old-school Rosetta Stone, the app shows you pictures and terms to get you to understand what things mean. Users can repeat after voice recordings and match phrases to the images to learn slowly. Rosetta Stone could be great for beginners, but in order to get access to all 25 languages and a lifetime subscription, you’d have to dish out $400. There are cheaper apps on this list that provide comparable experiences. HelloTalk Similar to Discord, HelloTalk provides voice and chat rooms to talk to folks from different countries. Its users can learn regional terms and talk about cultural differences. With a paid subscription, you can practice with a tutor or their AI chatbot. If you’re looking to learn a new language outside of your inner circle, HelloTalk can be a great fit. I enjoyed connecting with others on the app, but, as always when meeting strangers online, beware — some users treat it like a dating app. Fortunately, there are apps on this list that offer a similar AI learning approach without that added concern. How we test language learning apps As an intermediate Spanish learner, I was looking for an app that best catered to my needs, but I know everyone learns differently. So for each app, I assessed based on several factors. Can beginners use this to gain confidence? Will advanced speakers feel challenged? Are there enough opportunities to test reading and writing skills? How many ways can you learn vocabulary words? For those who want to have more conversations, what opportunities did each app provide to speak in that language? Bonus points if an app helped you learn a bit of the culture surrounding that language.

    "title": "The best headphones for running in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Whether you’re already an avid runner or hope to be one as you start a new training regimen, you’ll get more out of your exercise routine if you have some good music to accompany you. Getting into the zone during a long run with your preferred music, be it rap, classic rock or today’s pop hits, can totally change your experience for the better. To do that, you have to start with a good pair of running headphones. But not all wireless workout headphones are created equally, and runners need to consider specific factors before investing in a pair like how long your runs are, what type of music or other audio you prefer listening to and how much you want to block out the world during a session. I’ve tested out more than a dozen pairs to find which are the best headphones for running for all budgets and all kinds of runners. Table of contents Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones How we test headphones for running Others headphones for running we tested Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones Design Before diving in, it’s worth mentioning that this guide focuses on wireless earbuds . While you could wear over-ear or on-ear Bluetooth headphones during a run, most of the best headphones available now do not have the same level of durability. Water and dust resistance, particularly the former, is important for any audio gear you plan on sweating with or taking outdoors, and that’s more prevalent in the wireless earbuds world. Most earbuds have one of three designs: in-ear, in-ear with hook or open-ear. The first two are the most popular. In-ears are arguably the most common, while those with hooks promise better security and fit since they have an appendage that curls around the top of your ear. Open-ear designs don’t stick into your ear canal, but rather sit just outside of it. This makes it easier to hear the world around you while also listening to audio, and could be more comfortable for those who don’t like the intrusiveness of in-ear buds. Water resistance and dust protection Water resistance and dust protection are crucial for the best running headphones to have since you’ll likely be sweating while wearing them. Also, if you have the unfortunate luck of getting caught in the rain during a run, at least your gear will survive. Here’s a quick rundown of ingress protection (IP) ratings, which you’ll see attached to many earbuds on the market today. The first digit after the abbreviation rates dust protection on a scale from one to six — the higher, the better. The second digit refers to water- resistance, or waterproofing in some cases, ranked on a scale from one to nine. A letter “X” in either position means the device isn’t rated for the corresponding material. Check out this guide for an even more detailed breakdown. All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating (most have even more protection), which means they can withstand sweat and splashes but do not have dust protection. Active noise cancellation and transparency mode Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming a standard feature on wireless earbuds, at least in those above a certain price. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and continue to serve you when you’re off the trail, ANC is good to have. It adds versatility by allowing you to block out the hum of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute on public transit. But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand in hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many earbuds with ANC support some sort of “transparency mode” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for running headphones because you don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re exercising outside along busy streets. Lowering noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that. Battery life All of the earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most runners, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session. Speaking of, you’ll get an average of 20-28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a wireless charger to power up. How we test headphones for running When testing to determine the best running headphones, I wear each contender during as many runs as possible. I typically run three to five days each week, completing at least a 5K (3.01 miles) each time. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you’re on the tread or trail (as a note, I primarily run outside). I’m also paying attention to fit over time, particularly if the earbuds get slippery or loose while I sweat, or if they tend to pop out or feel less stable in my ears as I pick up speed or make quick movements. I also use the earbuds when not running to take calls and listen to music, podcasts and the like throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities. While I am also listening for audio quality, I’m admittedly not an expert in this space. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about sound quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and buying guides . Here, however, I will make note of audio-quality characteristics if they stood out to me (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’re able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases. A note about Jabra headphones Jabra announced that it will exit the consumer earbuds business , which is disappointing considering the company has made excellent headphones for running (and all other types of exercise). Our top picks include two Jabra models and we feel comfortable recommending them still because Jabra plans to support its current earbuds for &quot;several years.&quot; However, we&#39;re constantly testing new buds and reassessing our top picks, so we&#39;ll update this list accordingly in the future. Others headphones for running we tested Apple AirPods Pro The Apple AirPods Pro have an IP54 rating, which protects them from brief encounters with dust and splashes. While that’s more dust protection than many other earbuds we tested, it’s the same level of water-resistance that most exercise-specific competitors have. We generally like the AirPods Pro, but the Beats Fit Pro offer many of the same features and conveniences (namely good transparency mode and the H1 chip), with a design that’s more appropriate for working out. Beats Powerbeats Pro The Powerbeats Pro are a good alternative to the Beats Fit Pro if you’re a stickler for a hook design. However, they cost $50 more than the Fit Pro (although they’re often hovering around $180) and don’t offer any significant upgrades or additional features aside from their design. They’re also quite old at this point (having launched in 2019) and it appears Beats is putting more effort into updating its newer models instead. Anker Soundcore AeroFit Pro The Soundcore AeroFit Pro is Anker’s version of the Shokz OpenFit, but I found the fit to be less secure and not as comfortable. The actual earbuds on the AeroFit Pro are noticeably bulkier than those on the OpenFit and that caused them to shift and move much more during exercise. They never fell off of my ears completely, but I spent more time adjusting them than I did enjoying them. JBL Endurance Peak 3 The most noteworthy thing about the Endurance Peak 3 is that they have the same IP68 rating as the Jabra Elite 8 Active, except they only cost $100. But, while you get the same protection here, you’ll have to sacrifice in other areas. The Endurance Peak 3 didn’t blow me away when it came to sound quality or comfort (its hook is more rigid than those on my favorite similarly designed buds) and their charging case is massive compared to most competitors.

    "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on Disney+ and Hulu, Audible, Max and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in. Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This Amazon Spring Sale deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. The deal runs through April 30. Sling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange &amp; Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. Starz (six months) for $18 ($28 off): Starz&#39;s latest offer gives you six months of access for only $18, which shakes out to about $3 per month. This represents a 61-percent discount off the standard &quot;semi-annual&quot; plan, which puts six months of access up for $46. To get the offer, go to the Starz website and click on &quot;claim special offer.&quot; You&#39;ll have to provide your email address before the discounted rates appear. As an alternative, you could opt for the monthly plan discount, which is currently $3 per month for a total of three months. Paramount+ student discount - 50 percent off any plan: Ahead of March Madness , students can get half off any Paramount+ plan through April 8. To get the discount, scroll to the bottom of the Paramount+ homepage and click &quot;Get a 50% discount&quot; next to &quot;Are you a student?&quot; CBS shares broadcast rights with Warner Bros. Discovery this year for the men&#39;s tournament, so you&#39;ll be able to catch games on Paramount+ if you have the subscription tier that includes Showtime. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Fubo Essential for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, but Essential may be the best for most people. It offers access to 215 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. Note that regional sports content is not included here; you’ll have to go up to Pro or Elite plans for that. YouTube TV for $70/month for the first six months ($78 off): New subscribers can save a total of $78 when they sign up for YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Spotify student discount - Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. Hulu student discount - subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Max student discount - subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Sling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you&#39;ll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you&#39;ll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange &amp; Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+ and Hulu Duo Premium for $20/month : This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 47 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

    "description": "Gaming journalism stalwart Game Informer has risen from the ashes. More than thirty years after its debut issue back in August 1991, the media outlet was officially shut down by parent company GameStop in August 2024. Since then, the rights to Game Informer were acquired by Gunzilla Games and, in an all-to-rare win for today&#39;s media world, the entire team that worked for Game Informer at the time of its closure will return to their jobs. Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller posted the details about how the outlet was saved from the brink and noted that Gunzilla Games will be a hands-off boss. &quot;The new owners insisted on the idea of Game Informer remaining an independent editorial outlet,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They felt just as strongly as our team did that the only path forward was with an editorial group that made 100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so, without any influence from them or anyone else.&quot; “We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry,&quot; Gunzilla CEO and Co-Founder Vlad Korolov said . The website and its back catalog of content have been republished online. Game Informer &#39;s staff have also published reviews of more than two dozen games that came out during the site&#39;s hiatus and belatedly compiled their requisite best games of 2024 list. The print magazine is also expected to resume activity, and Miller said more details will be forthcoming about subscription and membership options. Gunzilla Games, which counts Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp among its leadership, made a battle royale shooter called Off the Grid and also developed the GUNZ blockchain platform.

    "description": "As it turns out, including a reporter in your national security leader group chat about military strikes isn&#39;t the only way to compromise sensitive information on Signal. NPR reported on Tuesday that, days after the Trump administration&#39;s preposterous and dangerous national security fumble , the Pentagon issued a warning against using the messaging app due to a phishing vulnerability. &quot;A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger application,&quot; a department-wide email obtained by NPR reads. &quot;Russian professional hacking groups are employing [Signal&#39;s] &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations.&quot; The publication says the memo states that Russian hacking groups are &quot;targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.&quot; A Signal spokesperson told NPR that the memo wasn&#39;t about Signal&#39;s security but about phishing attacks on the platform. So, if you&#39;re using the app, be especially mindful of attempts to trick you into linking devices to your account. Or simply communicate through different channels. The Pentagon directive follows a scandal that, at least in previous eras, would have ended the careers of a long list of high-profile officials. (In this one… who knows?) The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that a group of Trump administration national security officials inadvertently included him in a Signal group chat discussing military strikes in Yemen. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images The conversation included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, among others. They — with Goldberg essentially CC&#39;d — discussed the timing, targets and weapons involved in bombing Houthi sites in Yemen. A 2023 Department of Defense memo prohibited using mobile apps for even &quot;controlled unclassified information.&quot; NPR notes that military planning is many degrees more sensitive than that. And that doesn&#39;t even cover accidentally including a journalist in the conversation. The entire Atlantic article is worth a read, but a few gems from the chat include Hegseth&#39;s writing, &quot;I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It&#39;s PATHETIC.&quot; And, &quot;Nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.&quot; Adding to the &quot;It would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so dangerous&quot; nature of the fiasco, Hegseth went on camera to deny the chat&#39;s authenticity after the White House confirmed it. Although the fallout is still taking shape, here&#39;s an early taste. Watch below as retired US Navy captain and current US Senator Mark Kelly grills Gabbard and Ratcliffe on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

    "description": "We hear Signal is in the news . As longtime fans of the app, and secure messaging more broadly, we feel like it&#39;s our duty at Engadget to ensure you know how to use the software properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download Signal Signal is available on Android and iOS , as well as nearly every desktop operating system, including Windows and macOS. You can download the app by clicking one of the links provided above, or typing in &quot;Signal Messenger&quot; in your device&#39;s app store. Once you&#39;ve installed the app, proceed to set up an account using your phone number or an alias.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: If you want to install Signal on a workplace phone or computer, be sure to obtain approval from your employer; some organizations, such as the US government, either actively discourage or downright disallow use of the app.&nbsp; Create a new group Wonderful, you&#39;ve downloaded Signal! Now, to create a group chat, follow these steps:&nbsp; Tap the compose icon at the top of the interface.&nbsp; Select New Group. Add participants by selecting their name from your contact list, or inputting their username or phone number.&nbsp; Give your group a name (and a profile picture if you want).&nbsp; If the contents are especially sensitive, you may wish to enable Disappearing Messages and select an expiration time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#39;re in the process of adding new participants to a group, be sure to verify you&#39;re adding the right people. &nbsp; Some useful tips I would also suggest making use of Signal&#39;s Permissions feature to limit who can invite people to your chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings.&nbsp; Scroll down and select Permissions. Under &quot;Add Members,&quot; tap Only Admins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways someone can join your group chat is through a group link or QR Code . For additional security, you can set it so that admins must approve group link invites before the invitee can join.&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Scroll down and select Group Link.&nbsp; Switch the toggle to on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you know exactly who you can trust, but the guy down the hall might not! If you tend to get mixed up on names easily, Signal allows you to assign nicknames to users. After all, no one wants a case of mistaken identity. Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to assign a nickname to.&nbsp; Type in a name. You can also add a note, say describing the person&#39;s profession, in case you need additional context.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicknames are only visible to you, so don&#39;t be embarrassed to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp; How to remove someone from your group chat Look, even the best of us can make mistakes. Thankfully, Signal makes it easy to remove someone from a conversation thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to remove.&nbsp; Tap Remove From Group.&nbsp; How to delete messages in a Signal group chat So you somehow got through all of the above steps, added someone you shouldn&#39;t have and sent information that a relative stranger likely shouldn&#39;t have seen. Lets be honest, you&#39;re an edge case. But there&#39;s still hope if you caught your mistakes early.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap and hold the message on mobile (or hover the message bubble on desktop), Select Delete. Select Delete for Everyone. Now there&#39;s less chance of, for instance, a record of your civil and perhaps even criminal mishaps being shared to a notable reporter in a form potentially open to legal discovery.&nbsp; Ultimately, no matter how secure the messaging platform, if what you need to talk about is very, very sensitive, it&#39;s probably best to just &quot; get everyone in a room together .&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-add-someone-to-a-signal-group-chat-201430756.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals: The best sales from Shark, iRobot, Dyson and others",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-robot-vacuum-deals-the-best-sales-from-shark-irobot-dyson-and-others-092652375.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is only in its second year and, so far, we’ve found it to focus less on tech deals and more on home, cleaning and fashion discounts. That perhaps makes sense considering its timing, spring is a time for renewal and a refresh after all. But luckily, tech and home cleaning neatly intersect in the category of robot vacuums. We’ve tested dozens of these handy automatic floor cleaners and put the results in our buying guides . Right now, a number of our picks and related models are on sale so we’ve rounded up the best deals on vacuums Amazon’s latest sale has to offer. The best Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac for $400 ($350 off) : In our testing, we’ve been consistently impressed with Shark vacuums — but they’re not cheap. This machine can mop in addition to vacuum and is nearly half price at 47 percent off. Shark Robot PowerDetect NeverTouch vac and mop combo for $500 ($400 off) : This is the non-pro model of our runner up pick for the best combo bot. It mops and vacuums, quickly making a map of your home on its first run. The app easily lets you program where your hard and carpeted surfaces are, as well as set schedules. The base empties the dry debris and dirty water, then refills it with new water. The difference between this model and the Pro version is that this one doesn’t clean the mop with each use, so you may need to manually perform that task more often — but the price difference may make up for that lack. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off) : This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX for $140 (44 percent off) : The “S” in the model name stands for “slim” and it was one of the more low-profile machines we tried. It’s a pick in our guide to budget robot vacuums and has a long battery life and good suction power for its price. The main drawback is the lack of Wi-Fi, so instead of programming it with your phone, you’ll use the included remote. The best cordless vacuum deals Tineco Pure ONE Station 5 for $349 ($110 off) : This vac earned an honorable mention in our tests. The self-emptying base is a big selling point. We also liked the auto-adjusting suction and single-button start feature. The fact that it doesn’t require proprietary bags helps keep down the long-term cost, too. &nbsp; Tineco Pure ONE S11 cordless vacuum for $205 ($95 off with coupon) : Click the coupon to get $95 off our top pick for a budget stick vac. We like that it automatically adjusts suction depending on what it&#39;s picking up and is relatively lightweight when you’re pushing it around your floors. The bin is on the small side and the battery life isn’t as good as on other models, but it’s an easy-to-use, no-frills way to clean floors. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off) : This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Tineco Pure ONE Station FurFree for $400 ($300 off) : Of all the stick vacs our reviewer tried for our guide , this is the one she wanted to use the most. It’s super convenient with a dock that charges and empties and cleans all parts of the machine — brush, tube and dustbin — after each use. Plus the suction power is great and the iLoop smart sensor kicks up the suction when needed.

    "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed again. Publisher Paradox Interactive announced today that it is now targeting release in October 2025 instead of the first half of this year. &quot;Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date,&quot; the company said. Creating the sequel has been a trial of endurance that would test even an immortal undead&#39;s patience. Paradox parted ways with the game&#39;s original developer, Hardsuit Labs, in 2021. The Chinese Room, which made notable indie games Dear Esther and Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture , joined the project as developer in 2023. Today&#39;s update from offered some encouragement that the project is now in &quot;a late development stage,&quot; however it has decided to discontinue dev diaries that offered behind-the-scenes peeks at progress. The original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines game came out in 2004 after its own challenging development. Made by the now-shuttered Troika Studios, it was an story-driven game inspired by a tabletop RPG about several vampire clans in a modern-day Los Angeles. It was a commercial flop, but acquired a loyal audience over the years and even cultivated a community for mods and fan games .

    "description": "If you live in a rural area of the UK, you may soon be able to use your phone for satellite calls, messages and other standard data use. On Tuesday, the nation&#39;s telecom regulator, Ofcom, proposed using direct-to-device satellite tech to connect people in the UK&#39;s &quot;most rural and hard-to-reach places,&quot; like mountains and remote villages. Ofcom sees the tech complementing traditional networks, aiming to provide 100 percent mobile coverage in the UK. The regulator said the tech could also provide backup coverage during outages, offer service to ships and passengers in coastal waters without a connection and provide emergency 999 services (the UK&#39;s version of 911) in remote areas. In January, British telecom Vodafone made the world&#39;s first satellite video call using a standard mobile phone on a remote mountain in west Wales. Regarding the regulatory details, Ofcom suggests amending existing mobile spectrum licenses for frequencies already used by cellular providers (below 3 GHz). However, the regulator also offered alternative approaches, including introducing a new license for satellite services or allowing license-exempt use if certain conditions are met. Regardless of its specific policy approach, Ofcom said strict conditions would be attached to avoid interference with existing spectrum users in the UK and overseas. Ofcom is opening a consultation period with stakeholders from now to May 20. Depending on the feedback it receives, it could begin authorizing direct-to-device calls later this year.&nbsp; The iPhone 14 series was the first standard handset to offer direct-to-satellite emergency messaging . In iOS 18, Apple expanded the functionality beyond crises to any situation where you&#39;re off the grid . The Samsung Galaxy S25 series and Google Pixel 9 recently added similar functionality .

    "description": "Sunderfolk , a game that borrows elements from tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and couch party games like Jackbox, has a launch date. The fantasy RPG from Dreamhaven (the stomping ground of Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime ) arrives on April 23. You can play a demo today through April 7. While virtual tabletops like Wizards of the Coast&#39;s Sigil act as video game-like extensions of a traditional tabletop experience, Sunderfolk &#39;s premise is in using modern technology to simulate something like D&amp;D — but with more accessibility to casual players. Here, your phone becomes the deck of cards (and controller), while your TV or monitor is the game board. Although it supports remote play, this one sounds tailor-made for couch co-op. The game&#39;s story retreads familiar fantasy tropes, like a town of peaceful inhabitants invaded by dark and creepy monsters. Here, the heroes are a clan of anthropomorphic animals who each fit a familiar class like arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger or rogue. You can customize each with weapons, armor, items and skills as they level up. (When in doubt, play the classics!) Dreamhaven &quot;We were, with Sunderfolk, really trying to create something that would inspire people to get together in person,&quot; Game Director Erin Marek said in a preview trailer. &quot;We wanted it to feel similar to a game night, getting together to play a board game or getting together to play D&amp;D with a group of friends or family or loved ones that you really care about. And to share that experience together side-by-side.&quot; You can gather your cohorts to try the game for free on GeForce Now from now to April 7. The preview gives you access to all playable characters and an early part of the game. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need a paid GeForce membership ; a free account will do. Sunderfolk will cost $50 and be playable Steam , PS5 , Xbox Series X and Switch. But only the party member running the big-screen device needs to own the game; the phone app (iOS and Android) for your pals will be a free download when the game launches on April 23.

    "description": "Google has the pedal to the metal on its AI development. Just a few months after the debut of Gemini 2.0 , the tech giant has unveiled another upgrade in Gemini 2.5 . As with any new AI launch, Google is touting a strong performance on LMArena for Gemini 2.5, particularly its capabilities in coding, mathematics and science. The first model in this series is Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Google said this is a thinking model that&#39;s intended to provide responses grounded in more reasoning, analysis and context than the answers offered by classification- and prediction-driven models. It&#39;s a different approach than Google took with the Gemini 2.0 series, which started off with the more efficient and less expensive Flash version. &quot;With Gemini 2.5, we&#39;ve achieved a new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training,&quot; the company said in a blog post attributed to Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO of Google DeepMind. &quot;Going forward, we’re building these thinking capabilities directly into all of our models, so they can handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.&quot; Google had only just started rolling out Gemini 2.0 to its services, using it to power the newly added AI Mode in search and Deep Research for handling more complex queries. With today&#39;s launch, expect to hear more updates from the company about getting this latest version. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is available now in Google AI Studio, and Gemini Advanced members can use it directly in the Gemini app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-releases-gemini-25-ai-model-for-complex-thinking-182352224.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI just announced that all users will soon be able to generate images directly inside of ChatGPT. It’s rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team and, most importantly, Free users. This will be the default image generation tool in 4o, so there will be no need to open Dall-E whenever you want to whip up a picture of a cat in space eating lasagna or whatever. The feature’s also coming to Sora. The company says that the platform will &quot;generate high-quality images based on your prompt, conversation and uploaded files.&quot; To the latter point, it’ll be able to transform pre-existing images based on prompts. OpenAI is also boasting about significant improvements in text rendering and contextual understanding. These new tools are intended for both personal and professional use. As such, OpenAI gives a number of examples as to where this type of image generation could come in handy. These include the creation of infographics, social media promotional graphics and images with plenty of text, as seen below.&nbsp; OpenAI This being a modern generation tool, it can also handle high-end visuals. The company says it offers a &quot;strong capability for photorealism, including light, shadow, and texture accuracy.&quot; The ability to understand context could also be useful, as OpenAI says this could be used to create a “poster of birds found in Central Park” or a &quot;visualization of an art history era discussed previously in the conversation.&quot; Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqN Text and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx — OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 13, 2024 It&#39;s built on GPT-4o, an AI model that was first released last year . The &quot;o&quot; stands for &quot;omni&quot;, which is a reference to the model’s multimodal capabilities. This is what allows many of the aforementioned features, like being able to iterate on uploaded files. Today’s news looks like another step on the long road toward the “one AI to rule them all” functionality that Sam Altman teased a few weeks back .

    "description": "Apple announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference will be on June 9-13. The company is usually consistent with its event timing, so Tim Cook will probably take the stage to start the keynote on June 9 at 10AM PT/1PM ET. We&#39;ve already heard that iOS 19 and macOS 16 will be sporting new looks , so expect a focus on the latest software changes. And there&#39;s no way we won&#39;t be getting more Apple Intelligence updates. It was a core part of the iOS 18.3 update that rolled out at the start of the year and Apple has had struggles with some of the AI-powered features, particularly its notification summaries . One thing we don&#39;t anticipate seeing is the long-awaited update to Siri that will offer more personalization, also courtesy of Apple Intelligence. That project hit a delay in March and, no matter how hard we might hope otherwise , it seems unlikely the issues will all be resolved by June. Although the keynote is happening in-person at Apple Park, the rest of WWDC will take place online and is free for developers to attend.

    "description": "It&#39;s your lucky day if you&#39;re looking for good deals on Apple devices . Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , the Apple Watch Series 10 has dropped to its lowest price to date. The smartwatch is back on sale for a record-low price of $299. That&#39;s a $100 discount. The Apple Watch SE got a discount too. The device typically retails for $249, but you can snap it up for $169 . The Apple Watch Series 10 is our pick for the best smartwatch overall . That may not necessarily apply if you&#39;re an Android user, since you need an iPhone to actually use an Apple Watch. In any case, we gave the Apple Watch Series 10 a score of 90 in our review . Apple&#39;s current flagship smartwatch has a bigger screen, making it easier to see your notifications and health data (it&#39;s a pretty dang great device for wellness and fitness tracking). The thinner frame makes it more aesthetically pleasing too. On the downside, losing the blood oxygen feature from previous models is a bummer, but that issue was out of Apple&#39;s hands to a certain extent . It&#39;s perhaps not quite worth an upgrade if you have a Series 8 or 9 already. Apple isn&#39;t exactly reinventing the wheel here. Plus the sleep apnea detection feature that debuted alongside the Series 10 is also available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Still, if you&#39;re an Apple Watch newcomer or upgrading from an even older model, the Series 10 is likely your best option, especially for the sake of future proofing.

    "description": "Waymo is continuing to expand its foothold across the US, having recently started offering paid robotaxi services in more parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. Next up are Atlanta and Miami , and now the company has revealed plans to offer its driverless Waymo One service in the nation&#39;s capital in 2026. Before that can happen, though, Waymo will need to get approval from regulators. The company says it will &quot;continue to work closely with policymakers to formalize the regulations needed to operate without a human behind the wheel in the District.&quot; DC currently requires autonomous vehicles to have a human at the wheel, ready to take control if necessary. “Our priority remains ensuring that any company operating in the District — such as Waymo — does so in a manner that prioritizes safety, aligns with our regulatory framework, and integrates seamlessly into DC’s unique transportation ecosystem,” German Vigil, a spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, told The Washington Post . He noted that the agency is refining its approach to regulation &quot;based on public input, emerging best practices and lessons learned” from other jurisdictions. Waymo has tested its vehicles in DC for several years and it plans to &quot;continue introducing ourselves to DC’s communities and emergency responders over the coming months.&quot; Per the Post , if and when Waymo One does become available in the District, the robotaxis would not take riders to any of the region&#39;s airports, as they wouldn&#39;t (at least at the outset) have a permit to cross into Maryland or Virginia.

    "description": "Instagram is adding another tool to its arsenal of anti-bullying measures. This time, however, Meta is enlisting school officials directly in an effort to speed up its response to safety issues affecting young teens. The company is introducing a new “Schools Partnership Program” that aims to give teachers and school administrators a way to intervene when students experience bullying on Instagram. The program offers schools something that many parents have long said they wanted: a way to fast-track in-app reports that directly affect young students. Meta is promising that schools who join the program will have their reports “prioritized” in its moderation queue, and that it will respond to these reports within 48 hours. Schools that sign up will also get a “school partner” badge appended to their Instagram account, along with in-app information about how to use its reporting tools and other resources. Notably though, it doesn’t sound like Meta is hiring additional content moderators to aid with these new fast-tracked reports. When asked about increasing headcount to support the program, an Instagram spokesperson told Engadget only that reports from schools will be “expedited” via its existing reporting channels, and that schools will be able to add &quot;additional context&quot; to their reports. Meta says it’s already tested the program with 60 schools and that early results have been “promising.” Now, middle schools and high schools in the United States can sign up to join a waitlist for the program. The pilot program is far from the first time Instagram has tried to address bullying. The app introduced comment limiting features in 2021 , and added a tougher &quot; restrict &quot; feature last year. But while these features can help teens avoid certain types of negative interactions, they still required teens (or their parents) to tweak their settings. By now giving schools more authority to report specific instances of bullying or other bad behavior, Meta is offering some hope that it will be easier for schools to address the underlying behavior.

    "description": "When Sony&#39;s wireless earbuds come to mind, the flagship-quality WF-1000XM5 is probably the first product that jumps out. However, the company is also adept at building budget models, blending features and tech to give users a solid value for a lot less money. That was the proposition when the WF-C700N arrived in 2023 , offering active noise cancellation (ANC), solid battery life and other features for $120. Now, Sony is back with the successor to those earbuds, the WF-C710N , that packs a host of improvements but keeps the price the same.&nbsp; First, Sony says it improved ANC performance by employing dual mics on each earbud on the C710N. The C700N only had one on each side. The company is also using AI Noise Reduction this time around to improve call quality. On the outside, Sony replaced the physical button for the onboard controls with a touch panel, and the company added wear detection for added convenience.&nbsp; You can also expect longer battery life on the C710N. At 8.5 hours with ANC enabled, that&#39;s an hour longer than the C700N. With ANC off, you can expect up to two hours more than the previous model. Additionally, total battery life including the case is doubled, with up to 30 hours of noise-canceling use available (up to 40 hours with ANC off). Sony improved the quick charge feature as well, giving you an hour of play time in five minutes instead of the previous 10-minute window. The WF-C710N is available for preorder today in black, white, pink and a transparent Glass Blue for $120. I guess Sony&#39;s confusing product names aren&#39;t entirely going away after all.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-overhauls-its-budget-earbuds-while-keeping-the-price-the-same-010025194.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Discord has begun rolling out a redesigned desktop app that adds more customization to the client. To start, the new app increases the number of free themes to four. Where previously you could choose between two skins — light and dark — if you weren&#39;t a Nitro subscriber, now your options are light, ash, dark and onyx. In short, everyone gets access to more dark themes. Discord has also added three new UI density options — default, spacious and compact. These are separate from the app&#39;s existing message layout options, so it&#39;s another way to tweak the look and feel of the interface. With this redesign, the company is also finally giving users the option to resize the channel list. Discord has also redesigned the controls that appear when you&#39;re on a voice or video call. Now, more of the buttons you may want to press during a call will appear in the center bar along the bottom of the screen. At the same time, the mic and camera buttons feature more color, so you have a better indicator if you&#39;re muted or your camera is active. &quot;All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,&quot; Discord explains. Discord Separately, the redesigned app ships with a new overlay that Discord says is faster and won&#39;t impact game performance. Taking a page Valve&#39;s recent redesign of Steam , Discord has reworked the interface around widgets, meaning you can move around each individual element as you wish. The company has also re-engineered the overlay so that it doesn&#39;t &quot;hook&quot; itself into games. As a result, it&#39;s less likely to trigger anti-cheat systems like BattleEye . In turn, that means the new overlay is compatible with &quot;a larger portion of the most-played games on Discord.&quot; It&#39;s even possible to watch a friend&#39;s stream directly from the new overlay. The redesigned app and overlay arrive after Discord CEO Jason Citron announced last May the company would refocus on building the best possible communications tool for gamers. In 2020, Discord briefly rebranded itself as a general purpose chat app after many young people turned to the platform to stay in touch with their friends during lockdown. &quot;After taking stock of the world now that the pandemic is largely behind us, and learning directly from you about how Discord can be even more useful, we&#39;ve recognized the need to narrow our focus from broadly being a community-centric chat app to being a place that helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests,&quot; Citron wrote last year. The update also arrives at what could be a pivotal moment for Discord. According to a recent New York Times report , the company could go public as early as later this year. With 72 percent of Discord users regularly gaming on PC, ensuring those people are taken care of ahead of a potential IPO takes on a sense of urgency.

    "description": "It&#39;s no secret that Dyson devices are pricey, but you can find good sales on them if you&#39;re patient and know where to look. Case in point, the Amazon Spring Sale : not only are a few Dyson cordless vacuums included amongst the discounts, but this Dyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus heater and fan is as well. You can snag it for $300, or $170 off its usual price. As its name suggests, the Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus can heat your room in the winter and cool it off in the summer. Its fan mode includes Air Multiplier tech, which creates a smooth and uninterrupted airstream thanks to its lack of traditional fan blades. When you need some warmth, its ceramic plates heat up quickly. The appliance has two modes: focused and diffused. Focused mode warms or cools one person, while diffused mode heats your entire room or provides a gentle breeze during the summer. It oscillates at a 70-degree angle. Dyson&#39;s fan has a sleep timer with a shutoff range between 15 minutes and nine hours, and you can store its curved and magnetized remote control inside the appliance to help prevent it from being lost. The lowest we&#39;ve ever seen this product&#39;s price drop is $280, so being able to snag it for $300 in the middle of March, when we&#39;re nowhere near Black Friday or Prime Day, is about as good a deal as you can hope for. If you&#39;re on the market for other Dyson gear , a few more devices are included in the Amazon Spring Sale, including the Dyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum on discount for $330.

    "description": "Apple plans to start using images it collects for Maps to train its AI models. In a disclosure spotted by 9to5Mac , the company said starting this month it would use images it captures to provide its Look Around feature for the additional purpose of training some of its generative AI models. Look Around is Apple&#39;s answer to Google Street View. The company originally released the feature alongside its 2019 revamp of Apple Maps . The tool allows users to see locations from ground level. Apple blurs faces and license plates photographed in Look Around images to protect the privacy of any individuals caught in its survey efforts. &quot;In addition to improving Apple Maps and the algorithms that blur faces and license plates in images published in Look Around feature, Apple also will use blurred imagery collected during surveys conducted beginning in March 2025 to develop and improve other Apple products and services,&quot; the company writes in the disclosure. &quot;This includes using data to train models powering Apple products and services, including models related to image recognition, creation, and enhancement.&quot; Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget&#39;s request for more information. The company&#39;s Apple Maps image collection policy page provides a list of regions and dates when it plans to collect new images for Look Around. People can find when Apple&#39;s survey crews and vehicles plan to visit their area by sorting by country and then clicking on a specific region. Apple currently offers a few different features that rely on image generation models. Image Playground, for instance, allows owners of Apple Intelligence -compatible devices to write a prompt to create a new image. There&#39;s also Clean Up in Photos, which you can use to remove objects from your favorite snapshots. Google has been using Street View images to train AI models for years. In 2017, for example, a pair of researchers from the company trained a machine learning model to generate professional-looking photographs from a dataset collected from Street View.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-will-use-its-street-view-maps-photos-to-train-ai-models-150919972.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple may avoid a fine in one of the European Union investigations it&#39;s currently the subject of. The bloc&#39;s executive arm, the European Commission, will next week end a probe into whether Apple hindered iPhone users from easily changing their browser or search engine, according to Reuters . Apple is said to have complied with rules laid out under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to make it a cinch for users to switch to alternative browsers, social media platforms and other online services while giving smaller rivals a better chance to compete. Violations of the DMA, legislation that broadly seeks to keep the power of Big Tech in check, can lead to a fine of up to 10 percent of a company&#39;s total annual revenue, and up to 20 percent for repeat offenses. However, Apple may not be entirely off the hook. Per the report, the EU is set to dish out fines to both that company and Meta. The second Apple case concerns whether the company inhibited app developers from freely informing users about alternate payment options that are available away from the App Store ecosystem. As for Meta, it was reported this week that the EU may fine the company north of $1 billion for violating DMA rules as a result of its &quot;consent or pay&quot; ad-free subscription option in the region.

    "description": "Now that the Amazon Spring Sale is here, we&#39;re on the lookout for the best tech deals to grab from it. In typical Amazon fashion, Blink security cameras have been discounted for the shopping event. The Blink Mini 2 is available for $20 , which is half off its regular price and the best discount we&#39;ve seen. You can pick up two of the wired security cameras for $38, which represents a 46 percent discount. We reckon the Blink Mini 2 is the best budget security camera around. You can adjust the webcam-style camera to a variety of angles. It&#39;s weather-resistant, so you can place it outside if you have a special power adapter. The camera picks up decent (but not great) images, particularly those captured in the infrared nighttime view. It also has a built-in LED spotlight. Since Blink is an Amazon company, of course the Mini 2 ties into the Alexa ecosystem. You&#39;ll just need to have a Blink account before you can actually use it. As you might expect, you&#39;ll be able to view images captured by the Mini 2 via the Alexa app on an Echo Show, Fire Tablet or Fire TV but, curiously, not iOS or Android. To see the captures on your phone or tablet, you&#39;ll instead need to use the Blink app. You&#39;ll get some extra features — such as cloud storage and people and pet detection — if you sign up for the Blink Subscription ($3 per month for one camera, $10 per month for any number). Elsewhere in the sale, a five-pack of the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras is half off at $200 . This is our recommendation for the best security camera for Alexa users . Having five of them should be enough for many folks to keep an eye on everything that&#39;s going on around their property.

    "description": "Starting today, DJs will have access to Apple Music&#39;s catalog of over 100 million songs through more hardware and software platforms. DJs of all skill levels can build and mix sets on AlphaTheta, Serato, Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark and RANE DJ. This news follows the initial debut of Apple Music integration with Algoriddim&#39;s djay Pro software last year. There&#39;s also a new name for the whole initiative: DJ with Apple Music . And yes, a subscription is required. This isn&#39;t to be confused with Apple Music&#39;s DJ Mixes, a separate program that began in 2021 . The idea there was to attract creators of said DJ mixes and sets to the platform by leveraging Shazam&#39;s technology (owned by Apple) to ensure proper royalties were paid out. Now, Apple says, it&#39;s giving DJs access to its music catalog so it can be used as a creative tool and so they can easily tap into their personal libraries. There&#39;s a new DJ with Apple Music category page in the streaming app with curated playlists, and each platform has its own curator page complete with practice material. Spotify used to allow integration with third-party DJ apps, but the service stopped doing so in 2020 . If you&#39;re looking for options, djay Pro works with Tidal and SoundCloud, in addition to Apple Music.

    "description": "Anker&#39;s Eufy 3-in-1 E20 robot vacuum is $150 off right now , as part of Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. That brings the price down to $400, which is a record low. For those averse to using Amazon, the deal is also available directly from the company . The E20 made our list of the best robot vacuums , and with good reason. We loved the hybrid functionality, as this robovac quickly transforms into a cordless stick vacuum and a handheld unit. This in no way impedes the overall performance, as we found the automatic cleaning mode to be top-tier. The self-emptying base also holds a lot, considering its compact size. We praised the proprietary app in our official review , as editing room maps is both quick and easy. All told, it only took the robovac ten minutes to scoot around the house and create an accurate map.&nbsp; The suction power of the robotic unit is strong enough for major cleaning tasks, but the same cannot be said of the stick vacuum attachment. The power is on the weaker side. Also, it doesn’t come with a wall mount for the stick vacuum. That costs extra, to the tune of around $30. Today’s savings more than makes up for that.

    "description": "If you can&#39;t open a window for whatever reason, an air purifier can help make the air in your home a bit more comfortable. One of our favorites, the Levoit Core 400S air purifier , is on sale for $187 thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . While that&#39;s not a record low — we&#39;ve seen it as low as $177 last year — it&#39;s still a good discount on one of the most convenient air purifiers for large spaces. This deal is part of a larger Levoit sale during the Spring Sale that includes other air purifiers, humidifiers and more. We’ve featured Levoit in our list of the best air purifiers for its strong performance and smart features. The Core 400S can cover rooms up to 1,980 square feet using a three-stage filtration system to capture allergens, dust, pet dander and smoke. It also includes a smart sensor that adjusts fan speed based on air quality, so you’re not running it at full blast when you don’t need to. One of the Levoit Core 400S’ biggest selling points is its low noise output, which makes it a good fit for bedrooms or home offices. If you need to knuckle down and get some work done without distraction whilst keeping your room’s air clean and fresh, even at higher speeds, it stays relatively quiet compared to bulkier purifiers. It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands. Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness. If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.

    "description": "Anker makes some of the best power banks on the market and debuted a few great options earlier this year. That included Anker&#39;s Laptop Power Bank , a 25,000mAh portable charger with triple 100W USB-C ports and one USB port. Well, currently, that charger is on sale for $88, down from $110 — a 20 percent discount — as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale .&nbsp; The new power bank , available in Black and Silver, comes with two USB-C cables and can charge four devices simultaneously. It works with laptops, smartphones, cameras, gaming consoles and more. For example, it can charge an MacBook Air with an M3 chip to 50 percent in 33 minutes. It can also get an iPhone 16 to the same level in just 25 minutes. Plus, its display shows the battery&#39;s health and temperature, along with output and input wattage.&nbsp; Anker&#39;s 140W four-port wall charger is also discounted for Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale. You can pick it up right now for $77, down from $90. It offers a display that tracks power usage for each port, fast-charge status and temperature.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/irobots-2-in-1-vacuum-and-mop-drops-to-149-for-the-amazon-spring-sale-123058730.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’re looking for a budget-friendly robot vacuum that can handle both vacuuming and mopping, iRobot’s Roomba Combo Essential just hit its lowest price ever. Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , it’s down to $149 from $275, matching the lowest price we’ve seen. It previously dipped to $149 during the holiday season and earlier this year, but it’s unclear how long this deal will stick around this time. As you can see in our roundup of the best budget robot vacuums , we’ve consistently rated iRobot’s machines highly for their reliability and ease of use. The Roomba Combo Essential is a simple, no-frills option that both vacuums and mops, making it a solid pick for small apartments, dorm rooms or anyone who wants a cleaner floor without spending a fortune. The vacuum uses special multi-surface brushes to pick up dirt, dust and pet hair from hard floors and carpets. Unlike some budget models that struggle with transitions, this one automatically adjusts to different surfaces, so you won’t have to worry about it getting stuck. When it’s time to mop, the built-in mopping pad wipes down hard floors, tackling light spills and everyday messes. It’s not as advanced as iRobot’s higher-end models with precision scrubbing, but it’s a convenient way to keep your floors looking fresh with minimal effort. One of iRobot Roomba Combo Essential&#39;s most convenient features is its auto-adjusting cleaning power — the robot increases suction when it detects extra debris, so it’s more effective on high-traffic areas like entryways or around pet bowls. It also has cliff sensors to prevent it from tumbling down stairs and a low-profile design that helps it slip under some couches and other furniture for a more thorough clean. Despite it being an entry-level robot vacuum, the iRobot Roomba Combo Essential comes with app control and voice assistant support, so you can set cleaning schedules and initiate cleaning whether you’re at home lounging on the couch or away on vacation. For $150, this is a solid deal for an iRobot machine that can vacuum and mop, especially considering its usual $275 price tag. If you’ve been thinking about automating some of your floor cleaning, this is one of the most affordable ways to do it.

    "title": "The best vlogging cameras for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-vlogging-camera-151603452.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’re a content creator or YouTuber, Sony, Canon and other camera companies want your business. There are more vlogging-specific models than ever, with several new models having arrived since our last guide, including Fujifilm’s XM-5. Recent vlogging-specific models include Sony’s new ZV-E1 full-frame mirrorless that launched last year, DJI’s Osmo Pocket 3 and Canon’s compact PowerShot V10. Others in this guide, like the new Panasonic G9 II and Canon’s EOS R6 II are hybrid mirrorless cameras that offer vlogging as part of a larger toolset. Many have certain things in common, like flip-around screens, face- and/or eye-detect autofocus and stabilization. Prices, features and quality can vary widely, though. To that end, we’ve updated our guide with all the latest vlogging cameras designed for novice to professional creators, in all price ranges. Engadget has tested all of these to give you the best possible recommendations. Table of contents Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Upcoming cameras What to look for in a vlogging camera Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Best action and portable cameras If you’re just starting out in vlogging or need a small, rugged camera, an action cam might be your best bet. In general, they’re easy to use as you don’t have to worry about things like exposure or focus. Recent models also offer good electronic stabilization and sharp, colorful video at up to 4K and 60 fps. The downsides are a lack of control; image quality that’s not on par with larger cameras; and no zooming or option to change lenses. The best compact vlogging cameras Compact cameras are a step-up option from smartphones or action cameras, with larger sensors and much better image quality. At the same time, they’re not quite as versatile as mirrorless or DSLR cameras (and not necessarily cheaper) and they lack advanced options like 10-bit video. For folks who want the best possible quality without needing to think too much about their camera, however, it’s the best option. The best mirrorless vlogging cameras This is the class that has changed the most over the past couple of years, particularly in the more affordable price categories. Interchangeable lens cameras give you the most options for vlogging, offering larger sensors than compact cameras with better low-light sensitivity and shallower depth of field to isolate you or your subject. They also offer better control of your image with manual controls, log recording, 10-bit video and more. The drawbacks are extra weight compared to action or compact cameras, extra complexity and higher prices. Upcoming cameras If you’re not quite ready to buy, there are some interesting options on the horizon. Canon just teased a camera which could be the R50 V, likely to be a vlogging-focused update to the R50 I recommended. Canon may also announce the availability of the PowerShot V1, a compact camera with a Type 1.4 sensor that’s larger than the 1-inch sensors found on most compact cameras. Meanwhile, Panasonic just announced the S1R II, a 45-megapixel hybrid camera. Though the high resolution would suggest it’s mainly for photography, the S1R II can shoot 8K video at up to 30 fps and capture 5.7K 30 RAW internally. It’s fairly expensive, but considerably cheaper than other options including the Nikon Z8 and Canon EOS R5 II. That model is now on pre-order and set to start shipping by the end of March — stay tuned for Engadget’s review. What to look for in a vlogging camera Vlogging cameras are designed for filmmakers who often work alone and either use a tripod, gimbal, vehicle mount or just their hands to hold a camera. It has to be good not just for filming yourself, but other “B-roll” footage that helps tell your story. The number one requirement is a flip-around screen so you can see yourself while filming. Those can rotate up, down or to the side, but flipping out to the side is preferable so a tripod or microphone won’t block it. Continuous autofocus (AF) for video with face and eye detection is also a must. It becomes your camera “assistant,” keeping things in focus while you concentrate on your content. Most cameras can do that nowadays, but some still do it better than others. If you move around or walk a lot, you should look for a camera with built-in optical stabilization. Electronic stabilization is another option as long as you’re aware of the limitations. You’ll also need a camera with a fast sensor that limits rolling shutter, which can create a distracting jello “wobble” with quick camera movements. Steve Dent/Engadget 4K recording is another key feature. All cameras nowadays can shoot 4K up to at least 24 fps, but if possible, it’s better to have 4K at 60 or even 120 fps. If you shoot sports or other things involving fast movement, look for a model with at least 1080p at 120 fps for slow-motion recording. Video quality and color accuracy are other important considerations, especially for skin tones. Good light sensitivity helps for night shooting or concerts, and a log profile helps improve dynamic range in very bright or dark shooting conditions. If you want the best possible image quality and can afford it, get a camera that can record 4K with 10-bits (billions) of colors. That will give you more options when you go to edit. Don’t neglect audio either; if the quality is bad, your audience will disengage. Look for a camera with a microphone port so you can plug in a shotgun or lapel mic for interviews, or at least one with a good-quality built-in microphone. It’s also nice to have a headphone port to monitor sound so you can avoid nasty surprises after you’ve finished shooting. You’ll also want good battery life and, if possible, dual memory card slots for a backup. Finally, don’t forget about your camera’s size and weight. If you’re constantly carrying one while shooting, especially at the end of a gimbal or gorillapod, it might actually be the most important factor. That’s why tiny GoPro cameras are so popular for sports, despite offering lower image quality and fewer pro features.

    "description": "One of Samsung&#39;s CEOs, Jong-hee Han, has died due to a heart attack, according to Reuters and CNBC . He was 63. Han joined the company in 1988 and became the head of product research and development for visual display in 2011. He then led Samsung&#39;s TV business before he was named as the head of Samsung DX, which is what the company calls its merged mobile and consumer electronics divisions, in 2021. In 2022, he officially became the company&#39;s Vice Chairman and CEO. Han had no experience in mobile before he started leading the company&#39;s DX group, but Samsung gave him credit for helping it get to the top of global TV sales for 15 years.&nbsp; CNBC says Han was one of the executives who hosted Samsung&#39;s annual general shareholders meeting just a week ago and answered questions about the company&#39;s poor stock performance. During the meeting, Han apologized to the shareholders, telling them that Samsung &quot;failed to adequately respond to the rapidly evolving AI semiconductor market.&quot; He also told the shareholders that Samsung was having difficulties when it came to semiconductor-related mergers and acquisitions due to regulatory issues, but that the company was &quot;determined to produce some tangible results this year.&quot; Based on the notice Samsung published , Han&#39;s co-CEO Young-Hyun Jun is now the sole CEO of the company. Jun, who also heads Samsung&#39;s semiconductor business, was appointed as Han&#39;s co-CEO in November 2024. It&#39;s not clear whether Samsung is planning to appoint another CEO in the future.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-ceo-jong-hee-han-has-died-120029286.html?src=rss",

According to a report in <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/not-so-permadeath-blizzard-revives-hardcore-wow-characters-killed-by-ddos-attacks/\">Ars Technica</a></em>, Blizzard made the pronouncement in response to a string of DDoS attacks that seemed specifically targeted to cause the in-game deaths of members of a high-profile raiding guild.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hardcode mode was introduced with <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>. It’s a super intense, extremely difficult style of play where a character’s death is permanent no matter how it comes — whether it be falling in a mythic difficulty dungeon, getting ganked in PvP, or simply getting overrun by level 1 boars — is permanent. In regular <em>WoW</em>, characters can come back from or cheat death with a variety of mechanics which are disabled in Hardcore. The game mode has other adjustments, like requiring players to manually set their PvP flag, that Blizzard made to make the mode slightly less punishing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until now, there were no exceptions to the policy even in situations outside of a player’s control such as a death suffered during disconnection from the game server. And it seems like malicious actors were exploiting that strict policy to cause the deaths of members of a popular streaming guild OnlyFangs. According to <em>Ars Technica</em>, DDoS attacks seemed to coincide with the guild’s raiding attempts causing the permadeath of several members. The attacks were so frequent that soadapoppin, a popular Twitch streamer and OnlyFangs’ member, suggested that the guild might need to shutter operations indefinitely unless some kind of protections were put in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blizzard addressed the issue on the <em>World of Warcraft</em> forums saying that it is aware of the targeted nature of the DDoS attacks and are taking steps to rollback some player deaths</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’re taking steps to resurrect player-characters that were lost as a result of these attacks,” wrote <em>WoW Classic</em> associate production director Clay Stone. “In the future, Blizzard may elect —&nbsp;at our sole discretion&nbsp;— to revive Hardcore characters that perish in a mass event which we deem inconsistent with the integrity of the game, such as a DDoS attack.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s called <a href=\"https://www.geekbench.com/\">Geekbench</a>, and it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a cross-platform tool that simulates a bunch of real-world activities to give each device a score that roughly approximates how powerful it is. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not perfect (no benchmark is), but it can be revealing. In this case, it shows off an iPad that is very good at the things iPads <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\">have always been good at</a>, but it may be about to hit its limit &acirc;&#128;&#148; and definitely isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t ready for what&acirc;&#128;&#153;s to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you run a Geekbench CPU test on a device like the iPad, it tests both single-core and multicore performance. Most modern devices have multiple cores: the iPad&acirc;&#128;&#153;s A16 chip has five CPU cores and four GPU cores; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review\">the current iPad Pro</a> has nine and 10, respectively; and you can spec the latest Mac Studio all the way up to 28 CPU cores and 60 GPU cores. Not all cores are created the same, and we could talk about this forever, but let&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All you need to know is that a single-core process only does one thing at a time and is typically used for simple everyday computing tasks, like running your email app or refreshing your Spotify homepag &amp;hellip;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review\">Read the full story at The Verge.</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Leaf will return as a crossover SUV with a Tesla plug (!!), casting off its outdated appearance that previously led to rumors of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/4/23290517/nissan-leaf-ev-discontinued-electric-car-legacy\">its inevitable demise</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nissan is also rebooting some other familiar nameplates, including the Sentra and Rogue. But the newly refreshed, third-generation Leaf is coming first, arriving in North America in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It makes sense that Nissan would throw out its old looks for something new and daring. The automaker is going through a particularly rough patch at the moment, with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-02-27/nissan-sales-decline-failed-honda-merger-put-carmaker-in-crisis\">declining sales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/611974/honda-nissan-cancel-merger\">the collapse of a merger deal</a> with Honda. It needs some fresh products to help boost its overall image. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/US-Nissan-Range-Teaser.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Nissan is teasing several new products. \" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to tell from the photos, but <em><a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/754619/2026-nissan-leaf/\">InsideEVs</a></em> (which attended the reveal event in Japan) describes the new Leaf as egg-shaped (which is typical for most modern EVs) and about 3/4ths the size of a Tesla Model Y. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nissan didn’t reveal much about the new Leaf, aside from confirming that it will be built on the modular CMF-EV platform that also undergirds the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/20/23648673/nissan-ariya-first-drive-photos-price-specs\">Ariya EV</a>. The new Leaf will also have “significant range improvements over the previous generation.” The current Leaf sits in the low category for range, with the SV Plus trim getting a maximum 212 miles on single charge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perched on 19-inch alloy wheels, the new Leaf features a panoramic moonroof and — perhaps most shockingly — a native North American Charging Standard (NACS) charging port for Tesla Supercharger access. Nissan says it will be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23800436/nissan-tesla-nacs-support-supercharging-adapter\">the first EV in its vehicle lineup</a> to roll out of the factory with an integrated NACS port. As one of the first commercially available electric vehicles, the Leaf has always been saddled with outdated charging tech in the form of the CHAdeMO port. But now Nissan is rectifying that issue for this new generation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Leaf appeared to be headed for the compost heap up until recently, with <em>Automotive News</em> reporting in 2022 that Nissan would be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23219044/nissan-leaf-phase-out-discontinue-ev-pioneer\">winding down production</a> on the current generation by mid-decade, with no immediate plans for a refresh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nissan is promising more details on the new Leaf by mid-year. The company also announced that new ICE and plug-in hybrid versions of its Rogue SUV, and refreshed models of its mid-sized Pathfinder SUV and Sentra sedan, would be coming soon. For Infiniti, a refreshed three-row luxury QX60 SUV is on its way, alongside a new Sport package for the full-size QX80 SUV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/US-INFINITI-Range-Teaser.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4752184837776,100,93.049563032445\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Infiniti also plans on releasing several new models.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then in late fiscal year 2027, Nissan will introduce a new, unnamed EV slated for production as its Canton, Mississippi plant. The automaker says it will be an “adventure themed” SUV, so expect something of the Rivian/Scout/Jeep variety. In fiscal year 2028, Infiniti will release a luxury SUV inspired by the Vision QXe concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The automaker had previously discussed its plans to electrify half its vehicle lineup, including seven EVs for the US and Canada. Today, Nissan clarified that these future models will feature batteries manufactured in the US in partnership with SK one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Europe, Nissan said its reviving the Micra — a small car the company stopped making in the UK in 2010 — later this year, reintroducing the model as a compact EV. An electric variant of the Juke compact SUV will be launched in fiscal 2026.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In it, he described inadvertently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/635042/the-atlantic-pete-hegseth-houthi-signal-group-chat\">becoming privy to high-level military operation planning</a> that should never have taken place on Signal by people who really should have known better. The administration spent the next two days saying that the contents of the chat were “nonclassified.” On March 26th, <em>The Atlantic </em><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/\">released the texts</a>, which included weather conditions for targeted strikes, descriptions of the targets, confirmations, congratulations, names of specific drones used in the attack, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Previously, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5211867-hegseth-says-nobody-was-texting-war-plans-after-group-chat-breach/\">claimed</a>, “Nobody was texting war plans. And that’s all I have to say about that.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/nycsouthpaw.bsky.social/post/3ll7k7psjyc2q\">claimed</a> that “No ‘war plans’ were discussed” (but also later emailed <em>The Atlantic</em> to say “we object to the release” of the texts). At the subsequent hearing, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5212727-warner-gabbard-ratcliffe-classified-details-signal/\">reiterated</a> the claim that “no classified material” was shared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a follow-up article on Wednesday, <em>The Atlantic</em> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/\">released the messages</a>. Having previously omitted but alluded to details about bombing targets in Yemen, <em>The Atlantic </em>reached out to several government agencies, since so many government officials, including President Donald Trump, have been repeatedly describing the chat content as nonclassified. Leavitt had replied, again, that the texts contained “no classified information.” <em>The Atlantic </em>proceeded to publish the unredacted messages, withholding the name of a CIA intelligence officer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to <em>The Atlantic, </em>Hegseth’s “not war plans” included:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (Mq-9s)”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1536 F-19 2nd Strike Starts &#8211; also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are currently clean on OPSEC”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Godspeed to our Warriors.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, <em>The Atlantic </em>quotes Waltz’s text: “Typing too fast. The first target &#8211; their top missile guy &#8211; we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Atlantic </em>adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance responded a minute later: “Excellent.” Thirty-five minutes after that, Ratcliffe, the CIA director, wrote, “A good start,” which Waltz followed with a text containing a fist emoji, an American-flag emoji, and a fire emoji. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Signal incident is what happens when you have the most unqualified Secretary of Defense we&#039;ve ever seen.<br><br>We&#039;re lucky it didn&#039;t cost any servicemembers their lives, but for the safety of our military and our country, Secretary Hegseth needs to resign. <a href=\"https://t.co/IjwJmvwBY7\">https://t.co/IjwJmvwBY7</a></p>&mdash; Senator Mark Kelly (@SenMarkKelly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenMarkKelly/status/1904878146068902146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this week, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?id=0B7DCE01-6993-44BD-AD21-226432CE8D6E#:~:text=You%20know%2C%20again%2C%20this%20pattern,need%20for%20friends%20or%20allies.\">called</a> this use of the Signal group chat a demonstration of a “pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information” that “is reckless, sloppy and stunning.” Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/hegseth-national-security-group-chat-atlantic-reaction-00244983\">called</a> the debacle “amateur hour.” Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-goldberg-the-atlantic-trump-officials-group-chat-signal/\">said</a> if the incident did in fact occur it &#8220;represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.&#8221; Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Don Bacon from Nebraska called it “unconscionable,” and Republican Sen. John Cornyn from Texas said, “It sounds like a huge screw-up. &#8230; Is there any other way to describe it?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Tuesday, Trump told <em>NBC News</em> that the situation <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-signal-yemen-atlantic-group-chat-4b09973f4df3711d5d5ff88e8f9f96e0\">“turned out not to be a serious one”</a> and referred to it as a “glitch.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/discuss/t/important-update-about-google-assistant-in-waze-ios/380605\">an update on Tuesday</a>, Waze said it plans on replacing it with an “enhanced voice integration solution” in the future, which is most likely Gemini.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As many of you have likely experienced, this feature [Google Assistant] has not been working as intended for over a year, and we sincerely apologize for the prolonged inconvenience,” Waze said. “Rather than simply patching a feature that has faced ongoing difficulties, we’ve decided to phase out Google Assistant on iOS starting tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the past year, many <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/waze/comments/16m9jrd/google_assistant_not_listening_ios/\">Waze users</a> on iPhones <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/waze/comments/14kqb6y/voice_recognition_not_working_on_iphone/\">have reported</a> experiencing issues with giving Google Assistant voice commands. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/waze/thread/207371443/google-assistant-not-working-in-waze-iphone-ios-16-2?hl=en\">One user notes</a> that saying “Hey Google” would open Google Assistant, but it wouldn’t detect their voice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Google Assistant for Waze on Android phones will continue to work — but the question is for how long. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/629904/google-assistant-gemini-moving-on\">Google announced plans to transition</a> more users from Google Assistant to Gemini, adding that Assistant “will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices or available for new downloads on mobile app stores” starting “later this year.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Waze has already <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284037/waze-report-incidents-voice\">begun testing conversational reporting</a> with Gemini, allowing users to report incidents while speaking naturally.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The company <a href=\"https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1904896350853960065\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1904896350853960065\">announced</a> that it will be holding a Nintendo Direct on March 27th at 10AM ET, which will feature “around 30 minutes” of news about upcoming Switch games. Notably, Nintendo says that “there will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With the launch of <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games-review/629964/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-nintendo-switch\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/games-review/629964/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-nintendo-switch\">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a></em> last week, there aren’t a lot of first-party games currently on the Switch calendar.

As she says, “On any given day, I can be evaluating anything from robot vacuums, smart locks, and lights, to smart chicken coops, smart ovens, and connected coffee makers.”</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Jennifer has been a journalist for her entire career, “starting at </em>The Daily Telegraph<em> in London, England, right out of university.”</em> <em>She’s been at </em>The Verge <em>since 2021; before that, she was a freelance journalist for publications including </em>Dwell, Wirecutter, Wired, <em>and </em>US News<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Besides installing and testing a constant influx of smart tech, Jennifer lives with her husband, two children, a dog, two cats, a rabbit, and a backyard full of chickens. We checked out her office setup and asked her how she keeps track of it all. Here’s what she told us.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>That looks like a comfortable, if somewhat crowded, space. Where in your home is it?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My office is upstairs in our two-story house in Charleston, South Carolina, in what used to be a guest room. For a while, I had my desk in our bedroom, which was not great, as my husband worked 24-hour shifts and sometimes liked to sleep during the day. So, we decided to convert this to my office / guest room (the couch is a sleeper sofa).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time, I offered my two children the option to have this as their room, and I would take over one of theirs — both of their rooms have much bigger windows, which I coveted. But this is a bigger room with a bathroom! Surprisingly, they both declined, so I got all the space to myself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I really need it — I am on a first-name basis with my UPS, FedEx, and DHL delivery drivers,&nbsp;who are at my house multiple times a week delivering or retrieving packages. I test a <em>lot</em> of gear.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0037.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;A home office that’s crowded but comfortable.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Could you tell us a bit about your L-shaped desk?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The desk was custom-built by my very handy husband from upcycled scraps of African purpleheart and Brazilian bubinga wood he bought from a woodworker on Facebook Marketplace. It was originally designed to fit perfectly in the corner of our bedroom, but luckily, it also works really well in its new home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While I knew that having a big desk would attract more clutter, I have to face the fact that I’m a clutter lover. Also, I primarily use the long part of the L-shape for photographing, tinkering, and setting up a lot of the devices I test. It’s like my workbench. The drawers below it are full of surprisingly organized little trays with a variety of batteries, screws, screwdrivers, double-sided tape, SIM tools, and other hardware I need while testing gadgets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My husband also built a very useful “tech hub” into the desk: shelving under the desk on the right where I can tuck away things like my router (currently an Eero Pro 7) and the many smart home hubs, bridges, etc. I’m running. The wires all feed through strategically placed holes that funnel to a somewhat managed cable system under the desk — basically, a plastic crate that holds all my power strips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>And your chair?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s a leather La-Z-Boy. I picked it up at Staples while back-to-school shopping a couple of years ago. I used to have a very hard bright red office chair, which looked super cool but was not comfortable. This one is comfortable, if not particularly supportive; it’s very large and super plush — leaning back in it makes me feel like an executive or a supervillain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Tell us about the various tech devices you’re using. </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a lot! My main computer is my work-issued <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\">MacBook Air with M1</a>, connected to a Dell 4K monitor via a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NDGD2V5\">truly awful Anker USB-C hub</a>, which I need to replace. The monitor is mounted on an Amazon Basics adjustable monitor mount.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/insta360-Link-Noise-Canceling-Microphones-Specialized/dp/B0B826KS4B/ref=asc_df_B0B826KS4B?mcid=b37e35b6e3d1354b9948a287bd1ecef0&amp;hvocijid=1109426934316584004-B0B826KS4B-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=1109426934316584004&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9189439&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435178098&amp;th=1\">Insta360 Link PTZ 4K webcam</a> up top, which is great if a little frustrating, as its tracking feature can be very aggressive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then I have my personal computer, an ancient (2016) MacBook Pro on a <a href=\"https://raindesigninc.com/products/ilevel?srsltid=AfmBOooQRBfHTiTN70oywv5e6hkOjtFLpc-43lYDSWXojonyxYH_7KCl\">Rain Design iLevel laptop stand</a>, which is adjustable and super handy for moving around the house when I want a change of scenery. It’s connected to a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3WMX69W\">32-inch Samsung M80C Smart Monitor</a> with a Magic Trackpad and a Seagate external hard drive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0026.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;You can’t have too many displays. (Can you?)&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0033.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Great lighting along with some books and art.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I need two screens, and my Air can only handle one. It is annoying swapping between two computers, though, so generally, I only use the M80 when I need to keep an eye on multiple things at once, like during a big event.&nbsp; The monitor has streaming built in and is a smart home hub for Samsung SmartThings, so I also use it as a TV — it’s easy to see from the couch, and I’ll sometimes have tennis on in the background on mute while I’m working. I can’t listen to music while I write; it’s too distracting, but the tennis is soothing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All the little screens you see are smart displays. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23882652/amazon-echo-hub-smart-home-controller-hands-on\">the Echo Hub</a>, which gives me easy access to control connected devices in my office, such as lights, fans, and shades. Then an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23945192/amazon-echo-show-8-alexa-smart-display-review\">Echo Show 8</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review\">Pixel Tablet</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review\">Google Nest Hub</a>. They’re primarily for testing purposes, but they also make nice photo frames.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The keyboard is something I’m testing. I usually have a huge <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166?utm_source=google&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Paid-Search&amp;utm_campaign=DEPT_FY25_QX_USA_LO_Logi_DTX-Logitech-Shopping_Google_na&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw-e6-BhDmARIsAOxxlxXcxjOTdwo1C956wmE-oX1HHUt3McBCgMz9MioAuJvXjiBa9eJhDKAaAvSFEALw_wcB\">Logitech Ergo K860 keyboard</a>, as I have had some wrist issues. This is my first time using a mechanical keyboard. It’s a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung\">Matter-enabled</a> one by Third Reality, <a href=\"https://3reality.com/product/smart-mechanical-keyboard-mk1/?srsltid=AfmBOookeR1T1OHaaALTgf0bPiF0zqQDPzgK-SLDhgNWZQ69InxDGjAM\">the Smart Mechanical Keyboard MK1</a>. I can set the function keys to control my smart home; they act as individual buttons in Matter-supported ecosystems like Apple Home, so I can turn off all my lights with the stroke of a key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pink <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23030160/logitech-lift-ergonomic-vertical-wireless-mouse-price-features\">Logitech Lift</a> mouse is my favorite mouse ever. I’ve spent a long time looking for a comfortable mouse that doesn’t aggravate my wrist, and it does the job. I love its scroll wheel, but I set up its buttons to do something useful when I first got it and have never used them since.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s the Belkin DockKit stand (more on that in a bit) and my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ember-Temperature-Control-1-5-hr-Battery/dp/B07NQRM6ML?th=1\">Ember Mug</a> — which is four years old and on its last legs; I really need to get a new one. But I love it. There’s also an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560648/apple-homepod-second-generation-sound-quality-impressions\">Apple HomePod</a> on the bookshelf next to the desk; I use it as a speaker for the Apple TV, which is hooked up to the smart monitor, and it’s also mainly for testing smart home gear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You have a lot of tech that you’ve reviewed or are in the process of reviewing. </strong><strong>How do you keep track of it all?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I have a system; it&#8217;s not perfect, but it largely works. I enter everything into a Notion spreadsheet when it arrives, then store it in various staging areas until I’m ready to test. A lot of this stuff has to be physically installed in my house, so it rarely gets set up the day it arrives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On my workbench, I have the products I’m about to start testing. Currently, there are a couple of smart locks and a few doorbells that will be going in during my next install day. The dollhouse is my daughter&#8217;s and was built by my husband, but she doesn’t have room for it anymore. So, I&#8217;ve adopted it as a thematic staging area for tech that’s next in line for installation / reviewing. I’m about to start testing some new thermostats, so you can see a few in there.&nbsp;It also houses devices I might need to test with a new gadget or compare them to; that’s why the smart displays and smart speakers are there.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0009.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reviewing smart home tech means a lot of storage space is needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0035.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old-fashioned tech is fun to have on hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s a closet in the room (behind a curtain) where I store things that either need to be sent back or are further down the line in terms of testing, along with a bunch of older gear. I’m not good at getting rid of stuff — every time I do, I always end up in a situation where I’m like, “Oh no, I needed that Fibaro Z-Wave sensor to test with this new hub.” So, I just store lots of things in lots of boxes to avoid that eventuality. I really need to do a big clear-out of that closet, but I didn’t have time this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, many things I’m currently testing are already installed in the house — which is also technically my office! I have three exterior doors, so I test multiple locks, video doorbells, and sensors on those, as well as smart lights, thermostats, kitchen gadgets, security cameras, smart displays, smart speakers, and lots and lots of robot vacuums everywhere else in the house. I have a dozen robot vacs downstairs right now, as well as the three currently in the office. When the robot revolution happens, I will be the first to go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is there a story behind that painting of the castle on the seashore?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes! A great story. It&#8217;s also not a painting; it&#8217;s a digital collage of hundreds of photos of my close-knit group of girlfriends from high school (from a company called <a href=\"https://mosapics.com/\">MosaPics</a>). They make up the main photo, which is of a tin mine in a small town called Rinsey in Cornwall, England. We’ve been going on holiday there as a group since we were 15. If those ancient walls could talk…&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I see you use an ordinary paper notebook as well as your tech.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve always been a big stationery fan; I used to hang out in Smythson and Paperchases as a teenager (my wild years). I went through a bullet journal phase for a few years, but it was hard to keep it up with this job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, I have a nice Leuchtturm notebook for note-taking during meetings and interviews, and I use tear-off <a href=\"https://www.ramonaandruth.com/products/weekly-keyboard-planner-notepad?gQT=2\">Ramona &amp; Ruth</a> monthly and weekly desk planners to keep track of what I should be doing each day and in the future. Physically writing stuff down helps me retain information much better than typing.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0015.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;In the end, paper can be the best way to keep notes.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I had to notice the typewriter and that dial phone!</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I am… not a minimalist! It&#8217;s a good thing I moved to the US in my mid-20s, which forced me to get rid of a lot of my belongings, or I would probably have all my childhood stuffies on that sofa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The typewriter is an antique <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Luxe-Typewriter-Portable-Professionally/dp/B0DRH9N4S3?gQT=1\">portable Royal Deluxe</a> I picked up at a yard sale in Idaho years ago. It has a carrying case and is so cool. It was going to be the start of my typewriter collection. However, my husband (who <em>is</em> a minimalist) was not keen on that idea and has been trying to get me to get rid of it for a while, as we could never find a good spot for it. In the end, he just built me a shelf to put it on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The phone is deceptive; it’s actually relatively modern, the buttons are push buttons, and it&#8217;s from <a href=\"https://www.potterybarn.com/products/pb-grand-phone/\">Pottery Barn</a>. It was a wedding gift. It was functional for a long time, but I no longer have a landline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>That’s a fascinating little clock / calendar.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s an iPhone in StandBy mode on <a href=\"https://www.belkin.com/p/auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit/MMA008dq05BK.html\">Belkin’s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit</a>. It&#8217;s a super handy gadget. I keep it plugged in at my desk so my phone is charging and easy to see, but it also runs on a built-in battery, so I can take it downstairs if <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7483146093451332910?lang=en\">I’m recording a social video</a> or on a FaceTime call. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/7/24023612/belkin-stand-pro-iphone-dockkit\">DockKit</a> function lets it follow me around by tracking my face and body movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You’ve got a nice, comfortable-looking couch. And a great-looking lighting arrangement above it.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thank you! The couch is a sleeper sofa. It was intended to make this double as a guest room, but the first person who slept on it said it was the most uncomfortable bed they’d ever slept in, so we now have alternative arrangements for guests until we can get a better one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it&#8217;s great as a couch —&nbsp;handy for my family to sit on when they want to come in and bother me or occasionally for relaxing during some deep work. The kitten especially loves it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lighting setup is from Nanoleaf; it’s the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24233728/nanoleaf-blocks-wall-panels-smart-lighting-ifa\">new modular Blocks LED lights</a> that I’m testing.

Called <a href=\"https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/\">Relics</a>, the expansion launches today and introduces paleontology and archaeology elements to the sci-fi exploration game; players can now unearth the bones of alien creatures, piece them together, and even erect museums.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps most interesting is that players will be able to assemble the ancient creatures however they’d like. Here’s how developer Hello Games explains it:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect. It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Naturally, since this is <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, there’s also an element of danger. Certain bones and underground treasures will be guarded by golem-like creatures and a giant new type of worm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As with all of the game’s major updates, Relics is free to download, and it joins an increasingly massive list of new content for the game since its launch in 2016. Most recently, that has included <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1\">big changes to the game’s graphics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/599537/no-mans-sky-worlds-2-update\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/599537/no-mans-sky-worlds-2-update\">the addition of trillions of new planets</a>, and just as important: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234948/no-mans-fly-fishing\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234948/no-mans-fly-fishing\">fishing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

I sat down with fellow Ars staffers Aaron Zimmerman and Lee Hutchinson to talk through what we had just seen, covering everything from those goats to the show's pacing. Warning: Huge spoilers for seasons 1 and 2 follow!</p>\n<p><strong>Nate:</strong> <em>Severance</em> season 1 was a smaller-scale, almost claustrophobic show about a crazy office, its \"waffle parties,\" and the personal life of Mark Scout, mourning his dead wife and \"severing\" his consciousness to avoid that pain. It followed a compact group of characters, centered around the four \"refiners\" who worked on Lumon's severed floor. But season 2 blew up that cozy/creepy world and started following more characters—including far more \"outies\"—to far more places. Did the show manage to maintain its unique vibe while making significant changes to pacing, character count, and location?</p>\n<p><strong>Lee:</strong> I think so, but as you say, things were different this time around. One element that I’m glad carried through was the show’s consistent use of a very specific visual language. (I am an absolute sucker for visual storytelling. My favorite Kubrick film is <em>Barry Lyndon</em>. I’ll forgive a lot of plot holes if they’re beautifully shot.) Season 2, especially in the back half, treats us to an absolute smorgasbord of incredible visuals—bifurcated shots symbolizing severance and duality, stark whites and long hallways, and my personal favorite: Chris Walken in a black turtleneck seated in front of a fireplace, like Satan holding court in Hell.

I've flown here to drift electric Polestars on an icy lake called Stor-Skabram, near the small outpost of Jokkmokk, fully above the Arctic Circle. Yet the balmy weather serves as a constant reminder of the climate change that inspires much of the narrative around the electric vehicle industry.</p>\n<h2>EVs on ice</h2>\n<p>An opportunity to get somebody else's cars sideways as much as possible on ice and snow is a particularly enjoyable way to spend a day, if you like driving cars. More importantly, automotive manufacturers rely on this kind of winter testing to fine-tune traction and stability-control programming, ensuring their cars can work well in the depths of the deepest winter. For EVs in particular, winter testing presents a more complex range of equations.</p>\n<p>First of all, an EV can't ever turn the electronic nannies off entirely, because electric motors will rev to the moon with instantaneous torque the very instant their tires lose traction. So while software uses wheel speed sensors and regenerative braking, as well as accelerometers that detect yaw rates, each EV needs to then maintain progressive output responses to driver inputs that allow for confident performance and safety simultaneously.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/how-polestar-engineers-evs-that-can-handle-brutal-winters/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/how-polestar-engineers-evs-that-can-handle-brutal-winters/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

    "description": "日本高知大学等团队利用地球永冻层的地形数据，得出结论称火星东半球地下有丰富的冰。现在火星是平均气温零度以下极度寒冷和干燥的环境。约 40 亿年前温暖湿润气候时的海水有一部分在地下以冰的形式保留下来。载人航天探测中，水是人类维持生命不可或缺的物质，氢可以用作燃料。如果能在火星上获得，就能为有限的物资运输腾出运力。在 NASA 绕火星卫星拍摄的高清图像中，该团队在实际可以探测的区域内观察了约 4800 张照片，对冰缘地貌的分布进行了调查。结果发现，以东半球为主的3个区域内，多种冰缘地貌密集分布，由此得知地下可能存在大量的冰。3个密集区域与气候模型所需的大量积雪覆盖区相吻合。如果这些冰位于相对较浅可以挖掘的范围，那么着陆时或许可以利用。另一方面，西半球几乎没有冰缘地形。",

    "description": "AI 技术对电力的狂热需求可以上溯到 2012 年的 AlexNet。当时多伦多大学的 AI 研究员 Alex Krizhevsky、 Ilya Sutskever 和 Geoffrey E. Hinton 正在为图像识别竞赛 ImageNet LSRVC 开发一种卷积神经网络。在当时图像识别是非常有挑战性的。研究人员认为他们需要一个庞大的神经网络，该网络以首席研究员的名字命名为 AlexNet，它有超过 6000 万参数和 65 万个神经元。但一大问题是如此大的神经网络如何进行训练？他们的实验室里有几张英伟达 GTX 580 显卡，每张配备了 3GB 显存，但 AlexNet 太大没办法加载到单张显卡上。研究人员设法将训练阶段划分到两张并行工作的 GPU 上——一半神经元在一张 GPU 上，另一半在另一张上运行。AlexNet 以压倒性优势赢得了 2012 年的比赛，从此 AI 模型的规模不再受限于单张显卡了，而妖精也从瓶子里释放了出来。在 AlexNet 之后，越来越强大的 AI 模型需要成千上万张 GPU。根据 Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)的报告，2010 年到 2020 年间数据中心的功耗相对平稳，原因是英伟达数据中心 GPU 的功耗同期提升了大约 15 倍，因此能保持数据中心功耗的稳定。到了 2022 年基于 transformer 的大模型的出现推动了数据中心功耗的大幅提升。大模型需要处理数百亿甚至数千亿个神经元，训练之后的推理阶段还需要处理大量数据。Open AI 在训练新模型时使用了超过 25,000 张英伟达 Ampere 100 GPU，持续了 100 天，耗电量 50 GW 时，足以满足一个中型城镇一年的电力需求。根据 Google 的数据，训练占 AI 模型生命周期总耗电量的四成，剩下的六成是推理。功耗的飙升促使科学家思考如何在不牺牲性能的情况下减少内存和计算要求。研究人员尝试了模型剪枝、量化等优化方法。",

On Monday, </em><span><em>President Donald Trump said that what the Department of Government Efficiency is trying to do by cutting jobs and spending is &#34;not necessarily a very popular thing,&#34; but he thinks it has to be done to &#34;save our country.&#34;</em></span></p><p>My first days working as an HR specialist at the Office of Personnel Management were a dream come true &mdash; I loved my boss, I had a sense of purpose, and I felt like I was starting a promising career.<strong> </strong>When I was <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/opm-probationary-workers-fired-elon-musk-doge-trump-2025-2\">fired on a mass video</a> call less than two months after starting, more than my job crumbled. Our family&#39;s careful planning crumbled, too.</p><p>Before starting my job at the federal government, I&#39;d been out of the workforce for years. Deeply impacted by 9/11, I joined the Marines straight out of high school and left in 2010. But I stayed connected to the service; I met my husband during my active-duty years, and he&#39;s a Marine to this day.</p><p>Our time together has been dotted with long-distance &mdash; he deployed to Iraq when we were dating, to Afghanistan a year after we got married, to Bahrain while I was pregnant with our third child &mdash; and cross-country moves. We&#39;ve pinged back and forth between California and Virginia, done a stint in North Carolina, and now live in New Orleans. Come June,<strong> </strong>we&#39;re back to the West Coast.</p><p>Between getting my bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees, moving so often, and raising our kids, I knew it would be hard for me to have a job. And that worked well for a while since I wanted to focus on being a mom.</p><h2 id=\"9fc76a38-7337-4af4-9d2e-48a965072ffe\" data-toc-id=\"9fc76a38-7337-4af4-9d2e-48a965072ffe\">The government was meant to be a stable job option</h2><p>By the time we moved to New Orleans in the summer of 2023, though, I was ready to get back into the workforce. All of my kids were in school and it finally felt like my moment. Not to mention, my husband is eligible to retire in 2026 and my salary could help carry us through his retirement.</p><p>I started applying for jobs in January 2024, well aware that the federal government is a good option for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/military-spouses-affected-doge-federal-job-cuts-2025-3\">military spouses and vets</a>. It&#39;s not only the flexible remote work options but also the sense of understanding that comes with working with so many other veterans.</p><p>In May, I applied for the job I eventually landed at OPM. My official offer came in October and my first day of remote work was December 16. Getting the job was no small feat; according to the posting, almost 4,500 people applied.</p><p>The first few weeks were a lot of training, onboarding, the usual. Then, on February 12, two great things happened: military spouses on remote work agreements got exemptions from return-to-office mandates and I got my very first case to tackle independently.</p><p>The next day, everything changed.</p><p>I got an invite for an all-hands meeting set to take place in an hour. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-musk-doge-terminations-reinstatements-legal-battle-maryland-2025-3\">Probationary employees</a> &mdash; people still in their first one or two years in their position &mdash; were the only ones on the chaotic call. There were technical errors and we were growing more anxious until eventually Charles Ezell, the acting director at OPM, fired all of us, just like that. He didn&#39;t even introduce himself.</p><p>We were given around 30 minutes&#39; notice.</p><h2 id=\"71123d6d-e25e-42b6-8000-b9f76022f524\" data-toc-id=\"71123d6d-e25e-42b6-8000-b9f76022f524\">I&#39;m haunted by the way I was fired</h2><p>The worst part for me has been the supposed reason I was fired. According to my termination letter, I was terminated for poor performance. I wasn&#39;t even at OPM long enough to get a performance review.</p><p>It&#39;s been devastating and, frankly, I think about it all the time. I know it was just a job, but it was my job and I worked really hard for it. And it took me a long time to get it &mdash; years of moving, of waiting for the right moment, of working up the courage to submit applications.</p><p>I hate looking at my résumé and seeing I was fired for performance reasons. I wish they&#39;d <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reinstated-fired-federal-workers-got-job-back-getting-paid-2025-3\">reinstate me</a> just to fire me again the right way. Now, I&#39;m stuck in this weird limbo, a type of grief period: I&#39;m still mourning the job and I don&#39;t have any closure.</p><p>Applying to something new isn&#39;t an option, since we&#39;re heading to California in just over two months. I can&#39;t look for a new job there yet, and probably won&#39;t be able to until the fall when my kids are settled into their new schools. With the hiring freeze, I doubt I&#39;ll be able to work for the government again, and who knows how long it&#39;ll take to find, let alone land, a private-sector gig that works for my family?</p><p>Military life has been hard. But we&#39;ve always had a sufficient paycheck; if my husband retires next year, that won&#39;t still be true. And I feel like I just lost my shot at grounding us.</p><p>The day I&#39;m talking about all of this is my daughter&#39;s tenth birthday. I wish it could just be her tenth birthday, a day of joy and candles and cake &mdash; not the day I talked to a reporter about getting fired and feeling I have nowhere else to go.</p><p>My husband and I always thought there was general appreciation for the military and its families. Now, that&#39;s all starting to feel a little fake.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/veteran-military-spouse-government-job-doge-fired-devastated-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Roughly a decade later, at 28, they&#39;ve gone against the grain with endeavors like feature-length YouTube videos amid a short-form explosion and an apparel business that doesn&#39;t even bear their names.</p><p>They said they&#39;ve kept an eye on ventures that can appeal beyond their fandom of 14 million subscribers, knowing <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/youtube\">YouTube</a> fame can&#39;t last forever.</p><p>Over time, the duo&#39;s content has evolved from exploring abandoned places to paranormal investigations &mdash; most recently at <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-island-of-dolls-2016-3\">Mexico City&#39;s Island of the Dolls</a>. Given this conceit, they&#39;re leaning into experiential business ventures. That includes the purchase of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.hauntedfarrar.com/\">a haunted elementary school in Iowa</a>, which they&#39;ve used for filming and to offer tours, as well as a forthcoming escape room inside The Escape Hotel in Los Angeles.</p><p>&#34;That sense of community is everything to our business,&#34; Golbach said. &#34;That has been the sole reason why we&#39;re able to last more than a decade on YouTube.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"dea14cf0-23dc-42fd-8539-0be006268ceb\" data-toc-id=\"dea14cf0-23dc-42fd-8539-0be006268ceb\">Zumiez and Hot Topic have been force multipliers</h2><p>Their clothing company, XPLR &mdash; short for &#34;explore&#34; &mdash; launched in 2017 in partnership with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-fanjoy-influencer-merchandise-business-youtube-david-dobrik-jake-paul-2020-4\">merch purveyor Fanjoy</a>.</p><p>&#34;We didn&#39;t want to be the face of a brand,&#34; Brock said.</p><p>While he knew items plastered with their names and faces would sell well in the short term, the duo wanted to create something with &#34;deeper meaning,&#34; and a brand inspired by the genesis of their friendship.</p><p>They retained the rights to XPLR when they took operations in-house.</p><p>&#34;We just had an epiphany moment around the end of 2022 that we were making <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-influencer-merchandise-companies-creators-youtube-tiktok-instagram-2022-2\">merch</a> and we wanted to make clothing,&#34; Golbach said of elevating the line and expanding into new categories like mugs, jewelry, and shoes.</p><p>Online sales accounted for $7.7 million in 2024, but brick-and-mortar has been a force multiplier. In 2023, Golbach and Brock linked up with retailer Zumiez through their supplier. After a successful Black Friday trial, they landed in stores nationally. Hot Topic brought the range in-store in 2024. Physical retail accounted for $5.3 million in sales last year, the duo said.</p><p>The growth of XPLR has also sparked a sense of pride among fans who&#39;ve followed along since its inception.</p><p>Golbach said a meet-and-greet at Zumiez inside <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-mall-of-america-experiences-better-than-shopping-minneapolis-2022-4\">the Mall of America</a> attended by nearly 10,000 fans last year was &#34;the best day of our lives.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"9e98cddd-a59d-4957-b8e0-a0a0a56408ed\" data-toc-id=\"9e98cddd-a59d-4957-b8e0-a0a0a56408ed\">Doubling head count to 16 employees</h2><p>As their careers have grown, Golbach and Brock have been working behind the scenes to structure their enterprise for the long haul.</p><p>They had eight employees at the beginning of 2024, and now have 16. Chief Operations Officer Kong Pham, who has been with the company since 2023, has been instrumental in building the team, they said.</p><p>Brock called entrepreneurship a &#34;big learning curve,&#34; including cultivating management skills and shaping an autonomous company culture. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/slack\">Slack</a> is key for their mostly remote teams, which include content, merch, and management.</p><p>They recently onboarded staff to dub their videos in Spanish, which resulted in the biggest spike in YouTube subscriptions and ad revenue in a single day.</p><p>And while &#34;content is the train that carries everything else,&#34; Golbach said, brand deals aren&#39;t a huge part of the equation, accounting for just $900,000 in revenues last year.</p><p>They&#39;d prefer to launch their own brands, he said.</p><p>That&#39;s an approach that&#39;s become a trend across the creator landscape, with top stars like <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mrbeast-pitch-deck-creator-marketplace-replicate-success-2025-3\">MrBeast</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/emma-chamberlain-coffee-expansion-plans-detailed-in-leaked-deck-2025-3\">Emma Chamberlain</a> focusing on their own companies.</p><h2 id=\"a7be1df9-f246-493f-9791-25c6a3bfce8f\" data-toc-id=\"a7be1df9-f246-493f-9791-25c6a3bfce8f\">Bringing feature-length YouTube videos to the big screen</h2><p>As <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/after-beast-games-hollywood-wants-more-creator-influencer-tv-shows-2025-1\">Hollywood increasingly looks to native creators</a> for streaming films and shows, Golbach and Brock were ahead of their time. Their feature-length videos have been something of an anomaly &mdash; especially amid a short-form content explosion starting around 2020.</p><p>&#34;You get to know somebody when you spend an hour and a half with them,&#34; Golbach said.</p><p>During the Halloween season of 2023, they partnered with theater chain Cinemark to distribute &#34;A Week at the Conjuring House&#34; ahead of its YouTube premiere at 170 screens nationwide.</p><p>In 2024, their film &#34;Sam and Colby: The Legends Of The Paranormal,&#34; premiered at the famed TCL Chinese Theatre and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/10/indie-film-box-office-sam-and-colby-saturday-night-the-substance-1236108706/\">debuted at the No. 6 spot at the domestic box office</a>.

This image mirrors what&#39;s happening in your brain when you&#39;ve had too much screen time.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps you sit down to watch a TV show only to find yourself scrolling through </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-dont-have-social-media-accounts-not-allowed-2025-1\"><span>social media</span></a><span>. Somehow, a video of a person frosting a cake has pulled your attention away from the show you&#39;ve been waiting to see all week.</span></p><p><span>Popcorn brain is a term coined by David Levy in his book, &#34;Mindful Tech.&#34; This term describes &#34;the tendency for our thoughts to jump from one to another with fragmented attention, increased distraction and reduced focus,&#34; </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/12231/ashwini-nadkarni-psychiatry-boston-chestnut_hill\"><span>Ashwini Nadkarni</span></a><span> MD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, told Business Insider.</span></p><p><span>The constant barrage of content and notifications can leave you feeling tired and overwhelmed. Although popcorn brain isn&#39;t a clinical term, it&#39;s become an increasingly recognized phenomenon based on how our digital media consumption drives us to multitask.</span></p><p><span>Below we asked neuroscience experts how social media contributes to popcorn brain and how to reset mentally so we can get our work done and focus on things we enjoy.</span></p><h2 id=\"dcef1a6f-9cbf-476f-a1d1-61ab50664e8d\" data-toc-id=\"dcef1a6f-9cbf-476f-a1d1-61ab50664e8d\"><span><strong>Popcorn brain occurs when our brains are flooded with content</strong></span></h2><p><span>Nadkarni said that using smartphones and laptops prompts us to multi-task but engage inattentively. For example, you might be trying to write an email while switching between online shopping and an app that gives you news alerts.</span></p><p><span>Social media delivers a steady stream of quick, bite-sized content that demands constant attention, </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://comprehendthemind.com/dr-sanam-hafeez/\"><span>Sanam Hafeez</span></a><span>, a neuropsychologist, told Business Insider. Scrolling through posts and videos trains the brain to seek instant gratification.</span></p><p><span>You begin to crave that fast-paced stimulation. &#34;This leads to shorter attention spans, where it becomes harder to focus on anything for more than a few minutes at a time,&#34; she said.</span></p><p><span>Because your brain is on high alert, you never get a moment to slow down and relax. &#34;In the long run, this overstimulation can make us feel mentally drained and less capable of </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/smartphones-gen-z-creativity-attention-jonathan-haidt-anxious-generation-careers-2025-1\"><span>deep thinking or creativity</span></a><span>,&#34; Hafeez said.</span></p><h2 id=\"4367b7ae-1e48-48c5-8f5a-b354a58ee98e\" data-toc-id=\"4367b7ae-1e48-48c5-8f5a-b354a58ee98e\"><span><strong>We rely on different forms of attention depending on the task</strong></span></h2><p><span>Attention lies on a spectrum from undivided attention to inattention, </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.drdave.io/\"><span>Dave Rabin</span></a><span>, MD, Ph.D., board-certified psychiatrist, neuroscientist, executive director of The Board of Medicine, and cofounder of Apollo Neuroscience, told Business Insider. Undivided attention means paying attention to one thing to the exclusion of everything else.</span></p><p><span>There&#39;s also sustained attention, where you </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/3-things-neuroscientist-book-optimizing-workflow-efficient-as-possible-2024-9\"><span>focus on one thing</span></a><span> for an extended period. Another form is selective attention, where you switch between different tasks.</span></p><p><span>&#34;And then there&#39;s inattention, which is when you&#39;re not paying attention at all, and you&#39;re totally distracted,&#34; Rabin said. &#34;So if we think about that spectrum, the brain has the ability to learn how to pay attention just like a muscle.&#34;</span></p><p><span>At any given moment, you might need to switch from an inattentive state to one that requires deep concentration. If you don&#39;t train your brain to pay attention, that muscle weakens, and you lose some of the ability to decide what to focus on and for how long.</span></p><p><span>Accordingly, he added that the popcorn brain describes a state of decreased attention control, characterized by scattered thoughts and difficulty staying focused on one task or topic. &#34;The good news is you can fix it,&#34; Rabin said. </span></p><h2 id=\"a56abd45-2d29-4e23-ae04-587c0c431cf7\" data-toc-id=\"a56abd45-2d29-4e23-ae04-587c0c431cf7\"><span><strong>Fortunately, we can train our brains to refocus</strong></span></h2><p><span>Two strategies can help you deal with popcorn brain. The first involves </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/how-to-meditate\"><span>practicing mindfulness</span></a><span>, and the second concerns improving your concentration by altering how you engage with your digital devices.</span></p><p><span>1) Practice being mindful</span></p><p><span>Noticing that you&#39;re experiencing popcorn brain is a critical step toward overcoming it. &#34;Action is much easier once you have awareness,&#34; Nadkarni said.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Mindfulness describes the practice of attending to the present moment without judgment to cultivate a full awareness of one&#39;s thoughts, feelings, sensations, behavior, and surroundings,&#34; she added.</span></p><p><span>One way to build self-awareness is by doing what&#39;s called a body scan. This means finding a relaxing environment where you close your eyes, notice your breath, and shift your attention to different parts of your body and your surroundings.</span></p><p><span>Rabin said other body-based practices include yoga, soothing touch, and using apps that increase attention to the body. &#34;If you can practice sustaining attention, then you are training that attention control muscle to be strong in any situation,&#34; he added.</span></p><p><span>2) Create a calming and focused environment</span></p><p><span>It might sound counterintuitive, but slowing down allows you to reset so you can tackle your next project. To tune out distractions, Hafeez suggested taking five to 10 minutes to focus on your breathing or listen to calming music or sounds, such as white noise.</span></p><p><span>If your thoughts feel scattered, try writing out a to-do list. &#34;It can help organize your thoughts, making it easier to focus on one thing at a time,&#34; Hafeez said.</span></p><p><span>Another strategy is the pomodoro technique, which involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. &#34;Knowing you have a set time to focus can make it easier to dive in and stay on track,&#34; Hafeez said.</span></p><p><span>Finally, consider setting limits on your digital devices. Nadkarni suggested using only one device at a time, turning off notifications, closing apps or tabs, and taking breaks from social media.</span></p><p><span><em>Nandini Maharaj is a freelance writer covering health, wellness, identity, and relationships.

Mike Lawler made a splashy announcement: He&#39;d secured nearly $33 million in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/which-house-members-voted-against-earmarks-government-funding-2024-3\">federal funding</a> for more than a dozen projects across his New York district.</p><p>&#34;From day one, I have been laser-focused on delivering the tangible results our communities need, especially when it comes to federal funding,&#34; Lawler said while flanked by a slew of local officials in front of the Rockland County Sheriff&#39;s Office, which was set to receive more than $7 million.</p><p>$5 million for sidewalks and traffic signals in Ramapo. $2.25 million for water tank improvements in Pleasantville. $1.25 million for a sewer system in North Salem. These <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/house-republicans-vote-against-federal-funding-earmarks-2024-3\">so-called &#34;earmarks,&#34;</a> known officially as &#34;community project funding&#34; or &#34;congressionally directed spending,&#34; are one of the most direct ways that lawmakers can help their constituents. They also happen to make for a good political talking point, and Election Day was just three weeks away.</p><p>The funding still had to be voted on, but Lawler had good reason to believe that it would eventually come. Congress has generally managed to pass full-year spending bills each year, even if far behind schedule.</p><p>The congressman went on to win reelection, but the millions in federal largesse that he promised on that October morning were ultimately never signed into law.</p><p>That&#39;s because the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-passes-government-funding-shutdown-avoided-doge-elon-musk-2025-3\">GOP-written funding bill</a> that Congress passed this month included no funding for earmarks, affecting not just Lawler and his district, but the hundreds of other House members and senators in both parties who had each worked to secure earmarks. All told, it&#39;s a loss of more than $15 billion across thousands of projects.</p><p>Those communities will have to make do without that funding, at least for now. And in an ironic twist, it&#39;s the GOP&#39;s more vulnerable members who stand to lose the most politically.</p><h2 id=\"34762c87-4c2c-4bce-92ff-2a7e4167bc10\" data-toc-id=\"34762c87-4c2c-4bce-92ff-2a7e4167bc10\"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2><p>It&#39;s a little bit complicated.</p><p>Congress was supposed to pass a bipartisan, full-year spending bill by the end of December. But after President <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> won the presidential election, Republicans pushed to delay the final passage of the spending bills into March in order to allow the president and his new majorities in Congress to shape the legislation, which was still being negotiated between top Democrats and Republicans in both chambers.</p><p>That led to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-trump-government-shutdown-looms-2024-12\">bipartisan agreement</a> on a so-called &#34;continuing resolution,&#34; which largely maintains federal spending at current levels for a short period of time. The original agreement was blown up by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a> and other hardline conservatives, and after two days of chaos, Congress passed a short-term funding bill in late December that moved the next shutdown deadline to March.</p><p>Then Trump took office, and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-department-of-government-efficiency\">DOGE</a> began shuttering federal agencies, freezing funding, and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/judge-orders-trump-reinstate-fired-probationary-federal-workers-2025-3\">firing federal workers</a>. In the midst of bipartisan negotiations over the funding bill, Democrats pushed for provisions that would stop Trump from <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-usaid-funding-government-shutdown-2025-2\">withholding funding</a> already approved by Congress.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e402e269253ccddf9a51ea?format=jpeg\" height=\"1334\" width=\"1779\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York\"/><figcaption>Rep. Mike Lawler had promised $33 million for his district. It was never signed into law.<p class=\"copyright\">Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>Republicans refused, and negotiations broke down, raising the likelihood of a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/will-government-shutdown-happen-elon-musk-doge-whats-at-stake-2024-12\">government shutdown</a>. Eventually, the GOP came up with their own solution: a continuing resolution that would extend through the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends on September 30.</p><p>But continuing resolutions are supposed to be temporary, and they don&#39;t include earmarks.</p><p>Senators in both parties had secured $7.85 billion in earmarks, while House members secured more than $8 billion. Accounting for some overlap, the total funding would have amounted to somewhere between $15 billion and $15.5 billion, according to a congressional aide.</p><p>The bill ultimately passed on a roughly party-line vote, with all but two Republicans voting for it.</p><h2 id=\"1f788392-0ecc-4ea7-8a84-f2ca8a6a11fc\" data-toc-id=\"1f788392-0ecc-4ea7-8a84-f2ca8a6a11fc\"><strong>&#39;Those types of projects really, really, help a community&#39;</strong></h2><p>For Democrats, the political argument on the loss of earmarks is relatively straightforward. Almost all of them didn&#39;t vote for the bill, in large part because it handed <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-doge-democrats-spending-2025-3\">more spending discretion</a> to the Trump administration. In the days before the GOP bill passed, Democrats argued for another short-term bill to avoid a shutdown and allow for more time to negotiate a full spending bill.</p><p>&#34;The absence of community project funding is another example of Republicans making the decision to hand over the power of the purse to Donald Trump, Elon Musk and the administration,&#34; House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters this week.</p><p>With the GOP hoping to defend their majority, it&#39;s now some of the party&#39;s more vulnerable members who are the most politically exposed by the lapse in earmarks. These aren&#39;t the kinds of DOGE-led cuts that Republicans have been cheering on. Lawmakers fought to secure that funding for local governments and organizations in their districts. And in the House, Republicans were set to receive roughly two-thirds of the funding.</p><p>Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke had secured $10 million for a water system in a small town in a remote portion of his Montana district, hoping that the investment would allow the community to build more housing. &#34;Washington, DC doesn&#39;t know where Seely Lake is. I know where Seeley Lake is,&#34; Zinke told BI. &#34;Those types of projects really, really, help a community. That&#39;s who I work for.&#34;</p><p>Both Zinke and Lawler hold seats that Democrats targeted in 2024 and are likely to target again next year. For now, both men say they&#39;re confident that most of the funding they promised to their constituents will eventually come, perhaps in next year&#39;s spending bills. &#34;We&#39;ll just resubmit it,&#34; Lawler said. &#34;They&#39;re not dead,&#34; Zinke said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the GOP chair of the House Appropriations Committee, told BI in a statement that guidance for future earmark requests will be &#34;released in the following months&#34;</p><p>Like other Republicans interviewed for this story, the spokesperson blamed Democrats for the loss of the funding, arguing that their demand for restrictions on <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-trump-impoundment-act-sweeping-power-over-government-spending-2024-12\">Trump&#39;s impoundment moves</a> was unreasonable. &#34;Democrats hurt thousands of communities by using government funding negotiations as a weapon in pursuit of their contempt for President Trump,&#34; the spokesperson said.</p><p>While some Republicans are confident that they&#39;ll be able to secure the funding eventually, Democrats now feel uncertain whether they can rely on what has long been a bipartisan process.</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re gonna ask for submissions again,&#34; Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts told BI. &#34;I mean, I don&#39;t want to waste time if they&#39;re not going to do it.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-spending-bill-continuing-resolution-earmarks-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Depending on the extent of the work and what needs to be rebuilt in the RV, their labor costs can range from $15,000 to $45,000. The cost of materials, based on the level of luxury and quality, can range from $5,000 to $15,000.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s definitely nerve-racking to tackle something as unique as a home that moves,&#34; David, 37, told Business Insider. &#34;Everything has to be flexible and lightweight, so you don&#39;t compromise on gas mileage.&#34;</p><p>The Bay-Browns have recently expanded their business to non-mobile homes: small apartments in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/verci-coworking-social-hub-gen-z-consumer-tech-startups-2025-3\">New York City</a>.</p><h2 id=\"f7495eb5-74f8-4c6c-86bd-695519899ac7\" data-toc-id=\"f7495eb5-74f8-4c6c-86bd-695519899ac7\"><strong>Getting started renovating RVs wasn&#39;t easy</strong></h2><p>The Bay-Browns became inspired to renovate <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/changed-retirement-plans-live-in-rv-travel-full-time-2024-11\">RVs</a> after renting a run-down one during a 2020 trip out west.

They taught themselves how to restore it through <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/passive-income-how-to-make-money-youtube-email-affiliate-marketing-2023-1\">YouTube videos</a> and received help from an active online community of RVers.</p><p>They stripped the RV down to a shell and replaced the ceiling, studs, walls, paneling, and subfloor.</p><p>&#34;I think we were just dumb enough to give it a try,&#34; David told BI. &#34;The rest is history.&#34;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dc44b863d72727e197c81e?format=jpeg\" height=\"3072\" width=\"4096\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Amelia and David Bay-Brown smiling at each other\"/><figcaption>The Bay-Browns in an RV they renovated.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of David Bay-Brown</p></figcaption></figure><p>Selecting a buyer for the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/retired-early-moved-to-rv-be-close-to-family-2024-8\">RV</a> was as challenging as designing it.</p><p>Originally listed for $19,790 due to its 1979 build, the price went up after 200 people expressed interest in the RV, many willing to pay above the asking price.</p><p>In the end, they chose what Amelia called a<strong> </strong>&#34;sweet family&#34; from Kansas who offered $27,000 and had fallen in love with the RV.</p><p>Looking back, the couple admits the labor they put into the renovation likely cost more than they realized.</p><p>&#34;It took about six months of full-time work to complete the renovation,&#34; Amelia said. &#34;We made a good amount, but when you factor in our time, we probably got paid, like, two cents an hour.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"fe6671ee-b3e0-4669-ace9-716094624d59\" data-toc-id=\"fe6671ee-b3e0-4669-ace9-716094624d59\">Their pandemic project became a full-fledged business</h2><p>The Bay-Browns spent two years <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/took-infant-on-a-four-month-rv-trip-across-us-2025-3\">traveling the country</a> and renovating RVs while living in a motorhome they bought for $23,000 using some of the profits from the sale of the first RV.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve helped many people move out of their brick-and-mortar homes &mdash; whether it&#39;s because they want to live on the road, have a remote job, or a combination of both,&#34; Amelia said.</p><p>While working on client projects, they stayed in their own RV either on the properties or at nearby campgrounds.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dc45dbb8b41a9673fb3c79?format=jpeg\" height=\"2268\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A renovated kitchen by the Bay-Browns.\"/><figcaption>A kitchen in an RV that the Bay-Browns renovated for a family of six.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of David Bay-Brown</p></figcaption></figure><p>The Bay-Browns told BI that they rarely take on renovation projects that require a complete overhaul. However, they always sand down the walls, reprime, and repaint each RV.</p><p>Many older RVs have plain linoleum floors and walls, making them feel less homey. The Bay-Browns renovate their RVs to have an &#34;elevated aesthetic&#34; and personality by using materials like wood, tile, wallpaper, and textured finishes.</p><p>&#34;The traditional RV manufacturing process focuses on speed of assembly and is typically not designed with aesthetics in mind for the end user, which often results in bland interiors,&#34; David said. &#34;We ask clients, &#39;What would make this feel like home to you?&#39; and build their dream space.&#34;</p><p>Their renovations often focus on maximizing space and enhancing privacy in tight spaces. For example, they&#39;ve soundproofed walls for families with multiple children or created multi-functional rooms. One project involved converting a master bedroom into both a bedroom and wardrobe for a couple who wanted the RV to serve as both a home and a film set trailer.</p><p>&#34;What we really like to do is help people come up with unique solutions for their unique needs,&#34; David said.</p><h2 id=\"96c6a050-992e-4e65-8c20-03d68e97bc02\" data-toc-id=\"96c6a050-992e-4e65-8c20-03d68e97bc02\"><strong>Their clients are from all over the US</strong></h2><p>In 2021, the Bay-Browns purchased an 18-foot-long RV named Jute, which they envisioned as a &#34;library with a view.&#34; They installed a custom desk, a projection screen, and a patio deck, allowing guests to enjoy movies on warm nights.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dc40be69253ccddf99d49c?format=jpeg\" height=\"1001\" width=\"1840\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Side-by-side photos of Amelia Bay-Brown inside an RV, one on a swing and the other in a chair.\"/><figcaption>The Bay-Browns sold their RV, named Jute, for $40,000.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of David Bay-Brown</p></figcaption></figure><p>Once the renovation was complete, they sold Jute for $40,000.</p><p>A different RV, called Elle, was renovated for $45,000 in parts, materials, and labor.

All were fake.&#34;</p><p>Prosecutors say Javice tricked bank executives into thinking that if they purchased Frank, they would become the new owners of the names, emails, and addresses of all 4 million of these Frank <em>users</em>. These users were students at the start of their financial journeys, to whom JPMorgan could market checking accounts and credit cards.</p><p>In five weeks of testimony, lawyers for Javice have sought to show that this is not what she had meant by <em>users</em> at all.</p><p>Instead, her lawyers say, she told the bank that 4 million people had merely visited the website and clicked around a bit, a number supported by Google Analytics.</p><p>Frank only ever collected personal identifying data for 300,000 account holders, not 4 million, both sides agree &mdash; a fact the bank says they only discovered months after the merger.</p><p>So a central dispute in front of jurors &mdash; as they listen to closing arguments by attorneys for the government, for Javice, and for her co-defendant &mdash; will be this: How did Javice, 32, and Amar, 50, define &#34;user&#34; in negotiations with JPMorgan? As a nameless clicker? Or as a potential Chase customer whom the bank could email and text?</p><p>US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein raised this question in court on Tuesday as part of his preparation for instructing the jury on the law before deliberations.</p><p>&#34;What about the argument that by telling Chase that &#39;We have 4.25 million users,&#39; that they were telling the truth?&#34; he asked Georgia Kostopoulos, an assistant US attorney.</p><p>&#34;It was a lie,&#34; the prosecutor quickly answered.</p><p>&#34;But we have a number exactly the same as the number of users that visited the website,&#34; the judge pushed, referring to the Google Analytics total. &#34;And they&#39;re called <em>users</em>.&#34;</p><p>Kostopoulos countered that both Javice and Amar were present at a July 21, 2021, meeting where Javice assured JPMorgan Chase that a user was someone who had provided Frank with their name and other personal identifying information as part of signing up for a website account.</p><p>The bank was also told at that meeting that at least half of these 4 million users had used their Frank account to complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, the federal prosecutor added.</p><p>According to trial testimony, filling out a FAFSA would mean these users gave Frank their Social Security numbers and other valuable personal information, such as their income and savings data.</p><p>The judge has limited closing arguments to two hours per side.</p><p>The government is scheduled to present its arguments first, followed by Javice&#39;s. After lunch, jurors will hear arguments on behalf of Amar, followed by a brief rebuttal statement by the government.</p><p>The two co-defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, along with separate counts of wire, bank, and securities fraud. They face potential maximum sentences of 30 years in prison.</p><p><em>March 26, 2025: This story was updated Wednesday to include details from ongoing closing arguments.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-javice-trial-closings-one-word-will-play-starring-role-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

She also prioritizes mobility and balance.</p><p>Although she retired from her day job at 62, MacColl is still a working actor, and her fitness has seeped into the roles she&#39;s landed in recent years. She was a stunt actor in Reese Witherspoon and Will Ferrel&#39;s new movie &#34;You&#39;re Cordially Invited,&#34; played tennis as a supporting actor on the &#34;Sex And The City&#34; sequel &#34;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/and-just-like-that-most-cringeworthy-moments-season-one\">And Just Like That,</a>&#34; and did the splits in &#34;Poms,&#34; a 2017 movie about a senior cheer squad starring Diane Keaton.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e16e11b8b41a9673fb82b3?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Ginny MacColl doing the splits at the premiere of the movie POMS.\"/><figcaption>MacColl did the splits as a cast member in the movie &#39;Poms&#39; starring Diane Keaton.<p class=\"copyright\">Ginny MacColl</p></figcaption></figure><p>MacColl told Business Insider that she wants people to know it&#39;s never too late to get fit.</p><p>&#34;If I&#39;m doing this at 73, you can too,&#34; she said.</p><p>She shared the three things that helped her get so strong.</p><h2 id=\"4ef5e329-6aa1-43ab-ba59-ebb9b31db8b6\" data-toc-id=\"4ef5e329-6aa1-43ab-ba59-ebb9b31db8b6\">Have an attainable goal</h2><p>MacColl&#39;s daughter, Jessie Graff, is also an American Ninja Warrior, and seeing how strong she is inspired MacColl to build some muscle herself. MacColl first saw Graff, who has been a Ninja Warrior since 2013, compete live in a televised Las Vegas competition in 2015.</p><p>When MacColl was growing up, the conversation around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/strength-training-women-benefits-lift-weights-celebrity-personal-trainer-2023-1\">women lifting weights</a> was non-existent, she said, but seeing Graff &#34;flying across the stage&#34; changed her perspective.</p><p>&#34;I saw her muscles, I was like, &#39;wow, she&#39;s beautiful and curvy and strong.&#39; I love that. And so I asked her how could I get stronger?&#34; she said.</p><p>MacColl had never stepped into a gym at this point, so she set herself a goal of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pull-ups-how-to-improve-do-your-first-one-2021-12\">doing one pull-up</a>. &#34;I&#39;ve always felt that you need to have an attainable goal,&#34; she said. And achieving it, motivated her to set a harder goal of five pull-ups.</p><p>&#34;I think every time you reach a goal, you just set it a little bit farther, and so you keep trying to get stronger and stronger,&#34; she said. &#34;I enjoy the satisfaction of getting through an obstacle and the learning process as I keep at it.&#34;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e16ebb63d72727e1980edb?format=jpeg\" height=\"1800\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Ginny MacColl competing in American Ninja Warrior.\"/><figcaption>In 2022, MacColl was awarded the Guinness World Record for being the oldest female Ninja Warrior competitor in the world.<p class=\"copyright\">Ginny MacColl</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"6061c7a7-c83e-460b-8bfe-0a4a46539762\" data-toc-id=\"6061c7a7-c83e-460b-8bfe-0a4a46539762\">Be consistent (and patient)</h2><p>After you&#39;ve set yourself a goal, you have to be consistent if you want to achieve it, MacColl said, and don&#39;t expect to reach it overnight. It took her a year to do her first pull-up at 63: &#34;that&#39;s a long time to stay committed,&#34; she said.</p><p>You want to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-form-new-habit-stick-to-it-6-steps-2020-12\">form a habit,</a> which might look like working out every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, she said, even when you don&#39;t feel like it.</p><p>But you can start out slowly, for example, by committing to walking for 30 minutes a day, or doing some exercise with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/fitness/how-to-use-resistance-bands\">resistance bands.</a></p><p>&#34;Then just keep getting better and better and better and get stronger and stronger,&#34; she said.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e16dab63d72727e1980e99?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Ginny MacColl holds a tennis racket backstage on the set of &#39;And Just Like That.&#39;\"/><figcaption>MacColl played tennis as an extra on &#34;And Just Like That.&#34;<p class=\"copyright\">Ginny MacColl</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"087201c7-0893-49c2-b895-654d448f2cdb\" data-toc-id=\"087201c7-0893-49c2-b895-654d448f2cdb\">Find a class or personal trainer</h2><p>MacColl recommends signing up to a class, or<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/red-flags-when-hiring-personal-trainer-from-fitness-professionals\"> finding a personal trainer</a>, particularly when you&#39;re first starting out because it&#39;ll keep you accountable.</p><p>&#34;When you&#39;re paying for it, you tend to go,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;m not sure I have the discipline to make myself do the things if I didn&#39;t have the personal trainer and the appointment to go to.&#34;</p><p>Plus, if you&#39;re lifting weights, it&#39;s important to learn the correct posture otherwise, you can injure yourself.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/73-year-old-first-pull-up-at-63-simple-steps-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Its cofounders, WNBA stars Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, made childcare a priority. The playroom is stocked with toys, comfy couches, and of course, a mini basketball hoop. Other areas have a crib and changing table and a small, quiet room for nursing.</p><p>When designing the space, Unrivaled wanted to ease the mind of players with families so they could focus on the game.</p><p>Clare Duwelius,<strong> </strong>Unrivaled&#39;s executive vice president and general manager, told BI the league wanted to make the kids &#34;feel comfortable while their parents are hard at work here too.&#34;</p><p>Some <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wnba-team-power-ranks-strongest-teams-womens-hoops-experts-2022-5\">WNBA teams</a> offer family services, including the Minnesota Lynx, which contracts a company to provide on-site day care. Athletes Unlimited, which operates women&#39;s leagues, offers a stipend for childcare while players travel and other benefits on a case-by-case basis, according to its <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://auprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2023-PBC-Report-2.pdf\">annual report</a>. The<strong> </strong>Ladies Professional Golf Association was one of the first women&#39;s leagues to provide childcare. It started in the 1990s, complete with nannies and areas for children to play while their mothers spent long hours on the golf course or practicing.</p><p>Athletes have also fought for more support. WNBA players negotiated a $5,000 annual stipend for childcare in their 2020 collective bargaining agreement. The National Women&#39;s Soccer League contract guarantees parents either a stipend or childcare supervision paid for by their team, according to the league and its players association,</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/childcare-is-unaffordable-almost-everywhere-in-america-2023-1\">cost of childcare is high</a> in the US. In 2022, the median price of full-day care was between $6,552 and $15,600, according to the National Database of Childcare Prices.</p><p>Support for working parents has been a growing topic across sports. The men&#39;s and women&#39;s national soccer teams bargained together for equal pay in 2022, and folded childcare into both their contracts. More NFL teams have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sports/nfl/game-day-daycare-boosts-players-satisfaction-nflpa-survey-shows-2025-02-26/\">invested in day care</a> programs and family rooms, as well.</p><p>&#34;Childcare isn&#39;t a women&#39;s issue only,&#34; said Victoria Jackson, a sports historian and professor at Arizona State University. &#34;Childcare is an every parent issue.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"3a9fc37b-7d87-4835-b779-b17e91a8c4e2\" data-toc-id=\"3a9fc37b-7d87-4835-b779-b17e91a8c4e2\"><strong>Women athletes once faced a tough choice</strong></h2><p>Childcare has changed a lot for mothers in all professions. Sports, in particular, had a lot of catching up to do.</p><p>Bonnie Morris, a women&#39;s sports historian and professor at UC Berkeley, told BI that sports were once considered harmful to women&#39;s bodies.</p><p>&#34;The problem in a lot of people&#39;s minds is that women&#39;s peak reproductive years are the same as her peak athletic years,&#34; Morris said. &#34;So there&#39;s the idea that you have to make a choice.&#34;</p><p>US Soccer Hall of Famer Joy Fawcett recalled her time as a new mother and professional athlete in the 1990s.</p><p>After giving birth to her first child, Fawcett returned to play less than eight weeks later. She traveled to Minnesota for the Olympic Sports Festival. The US Women&#39;s National Team stayed in dorm rooms at a local college, but Fawcett was told her baby could not stay there. She couldn&#39;t breastfeed on campus either.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m there, and I don&#39;t have a lot of money, and I&#39;m like, shoot, &#39;what am I going to do?&#39;&#34; Fawcett said. &#34;Totally freaking out.&#34;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e1746363d72727e1981008?format=jpeg\" height=\"2879\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Joy Fawcett and her daughter sitting in the grass\"/><figcaption>Joy Fawcett and her first child sit on the field after winning a game in 1995.<p class=\"copyright\">Mike Powell/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>Fawcett and her daughter stayed with a woman volunteering at the event who opened up her home to them. Over time, Fawcett figured out a system for her and her kids when she traveled for games.</p><p>But she still worried about keeping her spot on the national team.</p><p>&#34;How do you stay in shape? How do I stay fit? There was no information out there, hardly,&#34; Fawcett said. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to lose my spot. I knew I would have to earn it to stay on the team.&#34;</p><p>The LPGA began offering childcare<strong> </strong>for its professional golfers<strong> </strong>in 1993, sponsored by Smuckers. Today, it&#39;s still free for athletes to use. The childcare trailer travels to each tournament, set up with cribs and a play area stocked with toys in the exact same way each week to keep it consistent for the kids.</p><p>Golfer Stacy Lewis said she uses the tour&#39;s childcare for her six-year-old daughter upward of nine hours a day, six days a week.</p><p>&#34;It was important to me to have my daughter see what I do,&#34; Lewis said. &#34;She&#39;s seen firsthand that it&#39;s hard work.&#34;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e174c2b8b41a9673fb8418?format=jpeg\" height=\"3543\" width=\"5315\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Stacy Lewis and her daughter after winning the Solheim Cup in 2024.\"/><figcaption>Stacy Lewis and her daughter after winning the Solheim Cup in 2024.<p class=\"copyright\">Scott Taetsch/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"22ea6686-5fb3-4a0e-b6af-f54083dfecb4\" data-toc-id=\"22ea6686-5fb3-4a0e-b6af-f54083dfecb4\"><strong>There are still challenges to being an athlete-mother</strong></h2><p>While leagues like Unrivaled have made strides in improving the childcare system, some athletes say there is more that can be done to support them.</p><p>At the collegiate level, the NCAA doesn&#39;t formally offer any kind of childcare support, but some colleges and universities do for students. Others are filling the gaps. Sara Vaughn, a former collegiate athlete who juggled parenting her daughter while competing in track, founded the Vaughn Childcare Fund to provide financial assistance to parents so they can continue to go to school or play sports without having to worry about paying for childcare.</p><p>Some WNBA players, like Gray, also say the league&#39;s $5,000 childcare stipend players negotiated for doesn&#39;t go far enough.</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s usually eaten up in the first half of the summer,&#34; Gray said. The league&#39;s regular season typically runs from May to September.</p><p>Gray said Unrivaled offers a comparable stipend to the WNBA but provides game-day care on top of it, so the money seems to go further for its athletes.</p><p>The WNBA Players&#39; Association has already decided to opt out of its collective bargaining agreement, which ends with the 2025 season. There have been <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/lynxs-napheesa-collier-says-wnba-players-are-prepared-for-possibility-of-lockout-amid-cba-negotiations/\">rumblings</a> among <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwzdV-LZOSw\">players</a> of a potential lockout over salaries.</p><p>Childcare could also be in the conversation.</p><p>&#34;Luckily for me, I do have a wife who is able to be there when I am not, but what about those players that do not have somebody that can be there 24/7?&#34; Gray said.</p><p>The WNBA did not respond to a request for comment from BI.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-sports-leagues-rethink-childcare-for-athletes-unrivaled-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

He breads and fries chicken and carefully fills each box with sides, including his grandmother&#39;s potato salad recipe, out of a 200-square-foot space that I visited on a Wednesday afternoon in February.</p><p>Clark&#39;s tablet chimes every time an order comes in. He works carefully but efficiently, packing, sealing, and labeling a substantial box of fresh food in about three minutes. The final step is placing the order on a robot, which delivers the bag to a smart locker on the first floor where an Uber Eats or Doordash driver will retrieve it.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eatboxchicken.com/\">Box Chicken</a> operates out of a West Los Angeles CloudKitchens location. The three-story building houses a handful of other restaurants &mdash; Clark&#39;s &#34;neighbors,&#34; as he refers to them. &#34;It&#39;s like an apartment complex &mdash; people have to move out because they couldn&#39;t pay the rent.&#34;</p><p>That&#39;s happened a lot lately, he told me, and his part of the neighborhood on the second floor is eerily quiet. If it weren&#39;t for the interview, his kitchen would be even quieter. It&#39;s a one-man operation.</p><p>In some ways, the solitude is nice, Clark said, &#34;but, as a business owner, I see where it&#39;s hurting us.&#34; Without a storefront, he lacks visibility and brand recognition. He has to rely on creative, grassroots marketing tactics, such as approaching strangers in public and asking them to taste-test his chicken on camera for a social media campaign. That&#39;s how I first heard of Box Chicken &mdash; on the Santa Monica Promenade when Clark was handing out free samples.</p><h2 id=\"7d15c816-d23b-49cd-ac32-360ebfb85930\" data-toc-id=\"7d15c816-d23b-49cd-ac32-360ebfb85930\">Running a digital restaurant</h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dc521b63d72727e197cb3d?format=jpeg\" height=\"3000\" width=\"4000\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Box Chicken ordering storefront.\"/><figcaption>Delivery drivers pick up Box Chicken orders from the smart lockers located inside CloudKitchens.<p class=\"copyright\">Shelby Moore for BI</p></figcaption></figure><p>Clark, 34, has been working in restaurants since he was 8 and earned an allowance helping out at his family&#39;s chicken restaurant in Atlanta. His mother, Reiko Clark, and aunt, Maggie Antoine, opened their first store in the late 1990s. They closed during the financial crisis in 2008 but reopened nearly a decade later in 2017, at which point Clark was old enough to take on more responsibility in the kitchen.</p><p>The family business was beloved, busy, and eventually expanded to multiple locations throughout Atlanta. The only slow day of the year was the Super Bowl, Clark said: &#34;Not one order came through because everyone&#39;s locked in.&#34; It&#39;s different in Los Angeles. Box Chicken opened its ghost kitchen doors last year and doesn&#39;t yet have a cult following. &#34;I miss the stressful environment, I miss seeing a line, I miss seeing all the tickets printed,&#34; he said.</p><p>However, the smaller kitchen space, which Clark designed and outfitted with equipment himself, has allowed him to open and survive in an expensive and competitive market that he never wanted to be in. His family was forced to sell their original restaurant in Atlanta to their business partner and main investor after a messy split, and the noncompete agreement limited them to operating in two states: California and Hawaii, which, as a restaurateur, are &#34;the two hardest places to open,&#34; Clark said. He and his family chose to bring their food to LA, where Reiko and Maggie grew up and originally conceived their chicken tender recipe.</p><p>While studying successful LA-based restaurants, Clark came across Main Chick, which began as a ghost kitchen before expanding to multiple locations and becoming a fixture of the food scene in Southern California. He was convinced a similar strategy could work for Box Chicken.</p><p>Running hypothetical numbers solidified his decision.</p><p>&#34;We were looking at a brick-and-mortar on Sawtelle and the rent was like 16 grand or something, maybe even higher. It&#39;s like, how are these places surviving? And they&#39;re not. They&#39;re always closing,&#34; Clark said. &#34;So, it is definitely cheaper.&#34;</p><p>Plus, as a one-man kitchen, he eliminates a major industry expense: labor.</p><p>Zeus Ferrini, the cofounder of the Los Angeles-based pop-up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thearepastand.co/\">The Arepa Stand,</a> said that&#39;s his main expense. &#34;Most of your money goes to pay your employees.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"f44ab88e-abe1-4474-834c-073d8fe5d6b4\" data-toc-id=\"f44ab88e-abe1-4474-834c-073d8fe5d6b4\">The challenges of operating without a brick-and-mortar</h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dc863369253ccddf99e4e6?format=jpeg\" height=\"3000\" width=\"4000\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Box Chicken cook in the kitchen.\"/><figcaption>Box Chicken is a one-man restaurant, with Clark at the helm.<p class=\"copyright\">Shelby Moore for BI</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ferrini and his sister, Mercedes Rojas, started selling traditional food from Venezuela, their home country, at the Mar Vista Farmers Market in 2019. Six years later, they have 12 staff members who help them operate in six different farmers markets.</p><p>They don&#39;t have a brick-and-mortar, either &mdash; they prep in a shared commercial kitchen space that they rent by the hour &mdash; but their issue isn&#39;t a lack of interaction with customers. It&#39;s scalability.</p><p>The pop-up model allowed them to launch on a shoestring budget &mdash; they spent about $400 on ingredients and a couple of coolers for their first market &mdash; and test their concept before putting up more of their own savings and quitting their jobs. For about a year, they did all of their prep out of the kitchen of their shared apartment before transitioning to the commercial space. While renting a shared kitchen two days a week is cheaper than having their own storefront, it&#39;s hard to tell how much money it&#39;s really saving.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e1be0969253ccddf9a293a?format=jpeg\" height=\"2268\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Multiple meat arepas up close on a stand.\"/><figcaption>The Arepa Stand serves up authentic Venezuelan flavors with locally grown California ingredients.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Zeus Ferrini and Mercedes Rojas</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;We do prep Thursday and Friday, but we&#39;re not actually making any money those days,&#34; Ferrini said. They do some catering, but the majority of their revenue comes in on the three days of the week they&#39;re at the markets: Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday. &#34;It&#39;s not like a regular restaurant where they&#39;re making the prep in the back, but they&#39;re also selling at the same time. That&#39;s the downside.&#34;</p><p>Plus, their market revenue is capped. &#34;You can only sell so much that one day,&#34; Ferrini said.</p><p>As a pop-up restaurant, it&#39;s easy to get &#34;stuck,&#34; added Rojas, who attended culinary school in Miami and spent a decade training under chefs at various restaurants across the US before opening The Arepa Stand. Setting up and breaking down multiple stands is time-consuming and logistically complex.</p><p>&#34;It deviates from opening the restaurant,&#34; she told me while cooking arepas and frying eggs from behind their booth at the Playa Vista Farmers Market on a Saturday morning in March. She&#39;d typically be driving back and forth between their weekend markets and overseeing operations but a staff shortage meant she was an integral member of the three-person team cranking out arepas from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. that particular day.</p><h2 id=\"64e70be2-505d-4685-b831-92d4f8690649\" data-toc-id=\"64e70be2-505d-4685-b831-92d4f8690649\">A hybrid approach</h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dc5147b8b41a9673fb3f0b?format=jpeg\" height=\"853\" width=\"1280\" charset=\"\" alt=\"La Tejana restaurant.\"/><figcaption>DC-based breakfast taco joint La Tejana started as a pop-up before transitioining to a brick-and-mortar.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of La Tejana</p></figcaption></figure><p>Gus May and Ana-Maria Jaramillo, who made the leap from a nomadic pop-up in 2019 to a storefront in 2022, can&#39;t imagine continuing to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/la-tejana-founder-story-opening-brick-and-mortar-small-business-2023-9\">grow their breakfast taco concept</a> in Washington, DC, without a permanent space.</p><p>&#34;Having a brick-and-mortar presence is absolutely essential to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.latejanadc.com/\">La Tejana</a>&#39;s longevity,&#34; May said. &#34;The pop-up model is great as far as keeping overhead low, testing out your product, and for growing your brand, but the amount of work required to pull off a single pop-up is far greater than the work required to open up for service at a brick-and-mortar.&#34;</p><p>It&#39;s also created more consistent revenue &mdash; &#34;you could be planning a huge Saturday sales day and a storm swings through and slashes your projected sales by 80%&#34; &mdash; and more revenue, May said. However, their expenses, particularly labor, are much higher. &#34;We went from two part-time employees to a staff of 18 in a matter of a few months. Our profit margin percentages are less, but our overall revenue is way up. I think this is probably true across the industry.&#34;</p><p>Both Box Chicken and The Arepa Stand hope to open their first storefronts in Los Angeles this year. When they do, they plan to keep at least a version of their current setups.</p><p>The farmers market pop-ups will help get people in the door, Ferrini said. &#34;Since we&#39;re in different parts of LA, you can funnel all those people coming to the farmers market to the brick-and-mortar &mdash; and that&#39;s the plan.&#34;</p><p>Clark envisions Box Chicken locations all over the world, with ghost kitchens helping fulfill online orders and free up time and space for the physical locations to take care of its regular customers.</p><p>They have big dreams but aren&#39;t delusional. Clark is reminded more often than he&#39;d like that sustaining a profitable restaurant is incredibly difficult as he watches his ghost kitchen neighbors shutter their doors. For Ferrini and Rojas, making the numbers work is so challenging that they&#39;ve continued doing pop-ups for six years while dreaming of an eventual brick-and-mortar.</p><p>In the meantime, they&#39;ll keep making hefty, colorful arepas.</p><p>&#34;Even though it&#39;s a hard industry to be in, it&#39;s also a very beautiful industry to be in at the same time,&#34; said Ferrini. &#34;It&#39;s nice to see the different people around that love your product and stop you on the street and are like, &#39;Oh my God, we love your product.&#39;&#34;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dc5278b8b41a9673fb3f56?format=jpeg\" height=\"3000\" width=\"4000\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Box Chicken kitchen building with cook and delivery man in front.\"/><figcaption>Clark dreams of opening multiple Box Chicken locations around the US and the world.<p class=\"copyright\">Shelby Moore for BI</p></figcaption></figure><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/restaurateurs-weigh-in-on-keys-to-survival-in-big-cities-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

I&#39;ll have half a waffle for some carbs and sometimes a protein shake on the side. So it&#39;s a healthy breakfast.</p><p><strong>Sounds like a great breakfast. Is it a chore or a pleasure to eat so much for work?</strong></p><p>It&#39;s definitely a chore, which is my wife&#39;s biggest call-out with me. I really have to force myself to eat and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/burn-fat-build-muscle-by-eating-more-food-lift-weights-2023-11\">keep my calories up</a>.

Our 9-year-old eats whatever&#39;s on her plate. She was eating oysters at 3 years old. She wants to try everything, and eating is the love of her life.</p><p><strong>Do you think a lot about nutrition for your family?</strong></p><p>Yes. That&#39;s why we love working with Plezi.

And for me, getting in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-cold-plunge-at-home-benefits-not-worth-it-review-2024-5\">cold tubs</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/depression-treatment-sauna-temperature-2024-5\">sauna</a>, compression sleeves to make sure you got good blood flow in your legs, different supplements &mdash; they all give me a little boost.</p><p>If I skip one of those, I feel it, and it doesn&#39;t give me the maximum recovery that I need, especially at this stage. So, I commit to my recovery and find fun in the process because that&#39;s more rewarding than what happens on the basketball court.</p><p>It&#39;s time-consuming. It&#39;s not always glamorous, but it does work. The results are proven, and it all allows me to play at a high level, even at this age.</p><p><strong>What does your ideal evening look like?</strong></p><p>A good family dinner, for sure. Yes, I have my recovery routine, but I also make sure I&#39;ve got time to be with the family and watch a movie with the kids. We are very much homebodies and so when you have the entire family at home, it&#39;s always great to enjoy that energy and the laughs.</p><p>I then either watch a good TV show with my wife or put on a game. I watch basketball all the time, so I&#39;m always doing homework and scouting and all that type of stuff.

    "description": "China's BYD, which has overtaken Elon Musk's Tesla in EV sales,&nbsp;will continue building factories overseas without partners as it has abundant funding, Chairman Wang Chuanfu said.&nbsp; Chinese EV giant to overcome tariffs with local assembly in some countries March 26, 2025 20:58 JST SHANGHAI (Reuters) — Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD aims to double its sales outside China to more than 800,000 cars in 2025 and will look to overcome tariffs by assembling cars locally, its chairman told analysts on an earnings call on Tuesday. BYD, which sold 417,204 units overseas in 2024, expects to see “a substantial rise” in its market share in Britain, which is “very open” to competitive Chinese products, according to a transcript of the call by Wang Chuanfu that was reviewed by Reuters. The company also sees “great opportunities” to grow rapidly in Latin American and Southeast Asian countries, where the governments and people are friendly towards Chinese brands, he said. With governments abroad weighing or levying tariffs against Chinese-made cars, BYD plans to keep its cost advantage by purchasing key components from China and assembling the vehicles in local markets, Wang added, without specifying the countries he was referring to. A BYD representative confirmed the target of doubling overseas sales to 800,000 units this year, but did not respond to a request for comment on the rest of Wang’s remarks. BYD is leading an overseas push by Chinese automakers, opening showrooms in markets from Australia to Germany as it seeks a respite from a brutal price war at home. Wang said last year that BYD expects exports to help shore up profitability. During the Tuesday meeting he told analysts he expected to see the majority of BYD’s profits coming from overseas markets “at a certain stage”. He didn’t specify the timing for that to be achieved. The company will continue building factories overseas without partners as it has abundant funding, Wang added. BYD is currently building a factory in Brazil, its biggest market outside China, although the development was hit last year by allegations of labour abuses. The carmaker is also building factories in Thailand, Hungary and Turkey. In addition, Wang said that BYD had no plans to sell into Canada and the United States in the short term due to geopolitical developments. The Trump administration has maintained duties of 100% on Chinese-made EVs, as has Canada. Wang told the analysts he was confident BYD’s profitability per vehicle would exceed Toyota’s when it reached the scale of the Japanese manufacturer, saying BYD’s cost control was better. Toyota 7203.T, the world’s top automaker by sales, sold 10.8 million vehicles in 2024, while BYD sold 4.27 million. BYD, which is targeting sales of 5.5 million units this year, has roiled the Chinese auto market by rolling out more affordable models, including its entry-level Seagull electric hatchback that sells for less than $10,000. It also offers smart driving features at no extra charge on most of its lineup. BYD plans to expand the team that works on intelligent software and components such as semiconductors to as many as 8,000 people from the current 5,000, Wang said, without giving a timeline. It also intends to take its affordable smart driving technologies to the global market in 2026 or 2027 and plans to send more employees overseas to handle the plan, he added.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Currencies/Rupiah-decline-different-from-1998-crisis-says-Indonesia-central-bank",
    "description": "Bank&nbsp;Indonesia held a press briefing on March 26, after the central bank, lenders&nbsp;and investors saw a rapid fall of the rupiah in the currency market the day before.&nbsp;(Photo by Ken Kobayashi) Bank Indonesia assures drop in rupiah will not lead to repeat of past crises ISMI DAMAYANTI ISMI DAMAYANTI March 26, 2025 20:52 JST JAKARTA — Indonesia’s&nbsp;central bank on Wednesday tried to tame market concerns over the rupiah’s recent depreciation to a 27-year low, saying the situation is far from a repeat of the 1998 financial crisis. “We’ve learned a lot since then,” said Solikin Juhro, Bank Indonesia’s head of macroprudential policy, during a press briefing after the central bank, lenders&nbsp;and investors saw a rapid fall of the rupiah in the currency market on Tuesday. “We don’t need to worry too much about this because this is far from the situation in 1998 with weakening purchasing power, yet a different situation,” said Bank Indonesia spokesperson Ramdan Denny Prakoso in the briefing, echoing the macroprudential policy head. After hitting a low of 16,640 per dollar on the previous day, the weakest since June 1998 , the rupiah rebounded slightly to 16,588 on Wednesday, based on Bank Indonesia’s Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR). In 1998, the rupiah plunged from 2,800 to 16,800 per U.S. dollar amid a lack of financial market resilience and limited foreign exchange reserves. “At that time, our financial system was far more vulnerable,” Juhro said. He pointed to Indonesia’s stability during the 2008 global financial crisis as proof of progress. “We now have stronger regulations and comprehensive policy frameworks in place.” “The banking sector now has been mitigated from crisis [with an] integrated prevention protocol that we developed,” Juhro added. “Macroprudential policy aims to ensure optimal credit growth, a resilient financial system, and inclusive financing, all of which support sustainable economic growth.” Coordinating Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto expressed confidence that the rupiah will rebound, supported by strong economic fundamentals, including solid export performance and healthy foreign exchange reserves in the medium to long term. “We also have regulations in place to retain export earnings within the country,” he said. Hartarto emphasized that these export earnings will serve as a key foundation for the rupiah’s stability. “With these fundamentals, we won’t remain under pressure for long.” The recent rupiah weakening came from a combination of factors such as a widening current account deficit amid export uncertainties due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policy, early concerns over fiscal deficit, and uncertainty surrounding the initial phase of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s administration. The underwhelming market response to the launch of the Danantara sovereign wealth fund&nbsp;and rumors of Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati’s potential resignation next month also hurt the currency’s value. Teuku Riefky, macroeconomics and financial market researcher at the Institute for Economics and Social Research at the University of Indonesia, said domestic sentiment has also affected the rupiah’s decline. “Capital outflows have been driven in part by domestic factors, including political tensions with rising demonstrations in the public,” said Riefky. A wave of mass demonstrations has erupted in several cities across Indonesia over the past week, driven largely by concerns over the legalized involvement of military personnel in civilian roles. Activists and civilian groups have called the policy a setback for democratic progress. To stabilize the currency, Bank Indonesia has intervened in multiple mechanisms, including the spot currency market, the domestic non-deliverable forward market, and the government bond market. The central bank will maintain rupiah stability in line with market mechanisms and the country’s economic fundamentals, according to Juhro. “Comparing with other currencies like the Japanese yen or Korean won, they’re not on a brink of crisis [because] their fundamentals remain resilient.” Juhro also noted that corporate performance remains robust with strong financial capacity, a sign of underlying economic strength. “This helps keep household risks in check and incomes remain within a relatively safe zone.” The stock market had a breather on Wednesday, with the benchmark Jakarta Composite Index&nbsp;rising 3.8% compared with Tuesday’s close.

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/China-demand-slump-hits-earnings-at-top-consumer-goods-companies",
    "description": "Consumers in China are reining in spending, dragging down earnings at&nbsp;some consumer goods companies. © Reuters Food, household goods makers looking for overseas growth face price-dumping claims WATARU SUZUKI March 26, 2025 20:19 JST HONG KONG — China’s top food and household product companies said they would step up efforts to seek growth overseas after weak demand at home dented earnings last year. Hengan International Group, a major producer of tissues and disposable diapers, reported on Tuesday that net profit fell 18% from a year ago to 2.3 billion yuan ($317 million) in 2024. “We’ll be looking for more opportunities overseas,” Hengan International Group CEO Hui Ching Lau told reporters on Tuesday. Lau said the company will be “promoting the development of overseas business as an important strategy this year more than before,” although he did not specify targets. Lau noted that “competition is extremely fierce” in China and the company is suffering the impact of a price war between e-commerce operators such as Pinduoduo and Douyin. For example, Hengan’s 24-box tissue pack is sold for just 33 yuan on Pinduoduo compared to 62 on Taobao, which is owned by Alibaba Group. Higher raw material prices and increased spending on promotions also eroded Hengan’s profit margin. “If everyone were to operate at a loss continuously, a company wouldn’t be able to keep going,” said Lau, projecting that such a trend would persist until the market undergoes consolidation. He added that China’s tissue market remains extremely fragmented, pointing to the “several hundred” small factories operating in just the one city of Baoding, in northeastern Hebei province. Meanwhile, bottled water maker Nongfu Spring’s annual revenue and net profit grew less than 1%, dragged down by a slump in the second half of the year. In particular, its packaged water business took a sharp hit, falling 21% from a year ago to 15.95 billion yuan. The company blamed the decline on “a surge of online attacks and malicious defamation” since February last year after Chinese nationalists hurled accusations at its red-capped water bottles for resembling the Japanese flag when held up against a piece of white paper. The company later introduced a new bottle with a green cap.

Results at both Hengan and Nongfu missed analyst estimates published on FactSet. China faces deflationary pressures on the back of a property market downturn and as consumers reined in spending due to weak job prospects. The consumer price index for the first two months of 2025 slipped 0.1% annually, bogged down by declines in food and consumer goods prices. Given weak demand at home, some companies are expanding abroad but such moves have led to accusations by other countries, including the U.S., that China was dumping excess capacity overseas. Premier Li Qiang has acknowledged the issue, saying in a government work report released earlier this month that China will “take comprehensive steps to address rat race competition.” WH Group Chairman Wan Long, right,&nbsp;told reporters in Hong Kong on Tuesday that the U.S.-China tariff war will “not have a significant impact” on the meat processing company.&nbsp;(Photo by Wataru Suzuki) Other companies that have a presence overseas fared better. The world’s largest pork producer WH Group, said stronger earnings in Europe and the U.S. helped offset lower packaged meat and pork sales in China. WH Group reported an 8% decline in packaged meat sales in China, which it attributed to a “lack of effective demand from the market.” Sales in Europe, however, grew by 25%, thanks to its acquisition of Spanish meat producer Argal which was completed in March 2024. In January, WH Group listed its U.S. meat processing subsidiary Smithfield on the Nasdaq exchange. Chairman and CEO Wan Long said the company would “continue to accelerate expansion in the U.S. and Europe” through acquisitions and would not be as active in China. When asked about the impact of the intensifying trade war between the U.S. and China, Wan said the additional tariffs would “not have a significant impact” on its business due to resilient demand in the U.S. and the group’s global footprint. WH Group said it would adjust its product mix to minimize the impact. On a positive note, higher spending for collectible toys propelled Pop Mart’s net profit by 189% annually to 3.1 billion yuan. Known for its animated characters made of vinyl, the group’s revenue in mainland China grew 52%, while overseas sales jumped nearly fivefold. Pop Mart CEO Wang Ning said during an analyst meeting on Wednesday that the company aims to increase its total revenue by 50% in 2025. Part of the strategy is to raise the ratio of its overseas revenue from 39% in 2024 to over 50%. He added that domestic performance in the first quarter has “exceeded our expectations,” thanks to hugely popular figurines from blockbuster movie Nezha 2. The company’s Hong Kong-listed shares climbed over 11% after his remarks.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Annual-Thai-censure-debate-centers-on-Thaksin-Shinawatra-s-political-role",
    "description": "Thai opposition leader and People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut speaks&nbsp;during the annual&nbsp;parliamentary no-confidence debate. © Reuters Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra easily survives no-confidence vote FRANCESCA REGALADO March 26, 2025 19:49 JST BANGKOK — Thailand’s main opposition People’s Party used a two-day parliamentary censure debate to question Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra about her father Thaksin Shinawatra’s influence on the government. The prime minister easily survived a no-confidence vote on Wednesday, 319-162, but the debate allowed the opposition to air in the legislature allegations that have dogged Paetongtarn over her seven-month tenure. Opposition leader Nattaphong Ruengpanyawut said Paetongtarn “lacks the qualifications” to serve as prime minister. “She evades taxes, evades her duties, and evades reality. Therefore, she cannot be trusted to continue as prime minister,” he said in his closing remarks late Tuesday. The censure debate is an annual ritual for the Thai prime minister. A political novice at 38, Paetongtarn’s election in August came after the Constitutional Court removed then-Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. Paetongtarn was quickly selected by her Pheu Thai party’s ruling coalition, a mashup of conservative parties that previously opposed her father Thaksin. Thaksin was deposed as prime minister by a military coup in 2006, with the court dissolving his Thai Rak Thai party. His self-exile abroad ended in 2022, the day of Srettha’s election. “Twenty years ago, Thailand lost everything to get Thaksin out of the country,” Nattaphong said, referring to the coup. “But 20 years later, Thailand is about to lose everything again to get Thaksin back,” he added, a nod to how Pheu Thai achieved power. Pheu Thai was beaten in the May 2023 general election by the progressive Move Forward Party, the predecessor of the People’s Party. The two groups initially planned to form a government, until Pheu Thai joined forces with its conservative former rivals. Paetongtarn stood by her close relationship with Thaksin. “It is not a bad thing for me to listen to or use or consider Dr. Thaksin’s advice because he is a person with knowledge and ability and is widely accepted both domestically and internationally,” she said in her closing remarks. Other opposition parliamentarians questioned Thaksin’s confinement in the Police General Hospital, where he served six months of a one-year commuted sentence before receiving a royal pardon. A surprise intervention was made by former Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan. He used his first speech in parliament to criticize Pheu Thai’s plan to legalize gambling. Prawit, one of the generals that led a coup against then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra — Paetongtarn’s aunt — in 2014, split from the Pheu Thai coalition last year. “Casinos will lead the country to the most dangerous disaster because it will weaken society and create many more gray businesses,” Prawit said. The cabinet plans to submit its draft bill on so-called entertainment complexes, which include casinos, to parliament despite questions of their legality. On Wednesday, Nattaphong exchanged pleasantries with Paetongtarn on the dais after the vote. Much like Paetongtarn, Nattaphong rose to the top of his party after a Constitutional Court ruling that dissolved the Move Forward Party. The opposition’s senior leaders were also banned from politics for 10 years. During the debate, Paetongtarn accused Nattaphong in turn of being influenced by another unelected official, alluding to progressive firebrand Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Thanathorn was banned from politics for 10 years in 2020. “If the party before mine had not been politically persecuted, today we might still have a prime minister named Thaksin, and your party might have a leader named Thanathorn,” Paetongtarn said. In rebuttal, Nattaphong pressed the prime minister to act on her party’s promise to reform the constitution. Nattaphong told Nikkei Asia last year that the constitution, instituted in 2017 by the leaders of the 2014 military coup, skews the electoral process and gives the court outsize power to dissolve political parties. The debate also yielded a promise from Paetongtarn to pay taxes on share transfers. People’s Party MP Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn revealed on Monday that Paetongtarn had not paid taxes on share transfers for nine years, accruing a bill of 218 million baht ($6.4 million). Analysts expect a cabinet reshuffle now that the no-confidence vote has passed. The reshuffle will likely be limited to the ministries controlled by Pheu Thai with coalition partners holding on to their portfolios.

    "description": "Ivan Espinosa, Nissan's incoming president and CEO, speaks to reporters at a media roundtable held at the carmaker’s technical center near Tokyo&nbsp;on March 25. (Photo by Sayumi Take) Carmaker seeks to revamp corporate culture and speed up product development SAYUMI TAKE SAYUMI TAKE March 26, 2025 18:33 JST TOKYO — Nissan Motor will have “no taboos” when it comes to exploring partnerships to enhance its competitiveness, according to Ivan Espinosa, who is preparing to become president and CEO of the struggling carmaker next week. Nissan is seeking partners that can push it into “the next era of technology”, said Espinosa, currently Nissan’s chief planning officer, at a media roundtable on Tuesday. “In the next 10 years, we need to really, really focus on developing our own ability to deliver and develop the intelligent car,” he said, referring to the use of artificial intelligence and other technologies to enhance the driving experience and autonomous features. He hinted at an openness to partnerships not limited to traditional carmakers whom he said lacked some high-level traits and competencies. Teaming up with such insiders&nbsp;could unlock synergies and spread costs in sales, powertrain technology and battery investment, “But there’s another [part] happening, which is, who should you partner with in order to develop this intelligent car in the future?” Espinosa will take the helm of the ailing company less than two months after it abandoned merger talks with Honda Motor , a plan many investors saw as a potential long-term solution to its weakening competitiveness. Nissan said&nbsp;it is still committed to collaborating on electrification and auto software technologies with its Japanese rival. “The first thing that came through my mind [when&nbsp;offered the job] is, a CEO is normally dealing with one or two major crises in his or her career … but I have to deal with four&nbsp;or five,” said the 46-year-old Mexican national who was appointed to be the next leader of the company earlier this month. Espinosa highlighted the need to address “a deep morale &nbsp; crisis” within the company, along with implementing turnaround measures initially announced under his predecessor, Makoto Uchida, who will step down at the end of this month. “We are, at the moment, lacking empathy at Nissan,” he said. “It’s kind of human nature … It’s very easy to start finger-pointing at each other” when business is&nbsp;difficult, he said. “Some of the messages that I’ve exchanged one on one with new executive committee members is the need to work as one single team,” said Espinosa. “We need to work together, hand in hand … with one single direction, so we can be quick, we can be determined, no more hesitation about what we should be doing.” Nissan must also speed up decision-making and product launches. For example, the carmaker currently takes about 55 months to develop a new car but will aim to shorten that time to about 37 months or less, he said. Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003 and currently serves on Nissan’s executive committee, admitted to “regret” over not pushing earlier for cultural and other internal changes. “Changing a big company like Nissan is not easy … [but] I’m determined to do that change. Now I have the ability to do so, [and] I have very clear in my mind&nbsp;what has to change.” A pressing issue for Nissan is generating revenue. It expects a net loss of 80 billion yen &nbsp;($532 million) for the fiscal year ending this month, taking it into the red for the first time in four years. Major credit&nbsp;rating agencies have downgraded Nissan’s credit to junk status with a negative outlook. The company will update its product lineup in key markets, including the U.S., where it is struggling with declining sales. For the fiscal year starting in April, it will launch a plug-in hybrid model of the Rogue sports utility vehicle in the country to address the absence of hybrids, an increasingly popular vehicle type. Nissan is also developing a new generation model of its hybrid e-Power system, seeking to enhance&nbsp;fuel efficiency when the car is traveling at high speed&nbsp;by up to&nbsp;15% versus the current system. The updated technology will reach American consumers in fiscal 2026 via a new model&nbsp;Rogue. Nissan is&nbsp;developing a new version of the Leaf, its&nbsp;flagship EV. (Nissan Motor) On electric vehicles, the company is developing a new version of the flagship Leaf, with improved aerodynamics, energy management and driving range. It will launch the new model in the U.S. in fiscal 2025 compatible with Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS), a first for a Nissan EV. Espinosa also hopes to address Nissan’s weak brand power, which has also been blamed for the company’s poor business performance. “My vision for the portfolio, moving forward, is to have maybe five or six brand-oriented models&nbsp;that should go to as [close to] every market as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;… cars that are really describing what Nissan is about,” he told reporters. Models like the Patrol SUV, the Z sports car and the Leaf, can help customers understand that “Nissan is excitement, Nissan is technology,” said Espinosa, a longtime product specialist.",

Starlink can provide its service to a maximum of 600,000 subscriptions in Vietnam, and the pilot program must end before Jan.&nbsp;1, 2031, the government said in a statement on its website. There will be no limit on foreign ownership of Starlink service in Vietnam. However, the project still needs to ensure national defense and security. The government has assigned the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Public Security to coordinate&nbsp;and the Ministry of Science and Technology to jointly work on the project. Vietnam’s moves come just a week ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected announcement on reciprocal tariffs on April 2 that could apply to all U.S. trading partners, but he said on Monday that he “may give a lot of countries breaks.” Vietnam has been trying to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S., which was $123.5 billion last year and the third biggest trade gap for the U.S. after China and Mexico. Its finance ministry announced Tuesday that Vietnam is planning to&nbsp;cut import tariffs on several U.S. products, including liquefied natural gas, cars, ethanol&nbsp;and other agriculture products. Vietnam’s economic growth of 7.1% in 2024 was one of the strongest in the region, but it is highly reliant on exports, which grew 14% last year, and the U.S. was its biggest market. Last week, Vietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh greeted a representative of conglomerate The Trump Organization in Vietnam. The company is planning to invest around $1.5 billion in an urban complex project that includes a golf course in northern Hung Yen province , according to a report on the prime minister’s website. The Starlink services that will be allowed include fixed satellite services (internet access services and&nbsp;privately leased channel services for mobile receiving and transmitting stations) and mobile satellite services (internet access services at sea and&nbsp;on airplanes), the Vietnamese&nbsp;government statement said. The country’s remote areas still have limited access to the internet due to the high cost of infrastructure investment, so low-earth orbit systems such as Starlink can “act as a complementary solution to provide telecommunication and internet services with many advantages,” Vietnam’s Authority of Radio Frequency Management said on its website earlier this month. Vietnam’s approval of Starlink also aligns with its efforts to boost its digital transformation and attract more foreign investments, especially in high-tech sectors such as AI and semiconductors. Vietnam has urged foreign investors to boost their investments and involve local companies in their supply chains. Samsung has invested more than $20 billion in Vietnam, and&nbsp;Nvidia is opening an R&amp;D center in the country. The Starlink pilot plan may be canceled at any time if the license is withdrawn or the project violates the requirements stated by the authorities. Last week, the Italian defense minister said negotiations on a potential contract between Starlink and the Italian government have stalled, which reflected broader geopolitical tensions, Reuters reported.",

At the end of last year, the Philippine restaurant group had 9,766 outlets worldwide, including those of its flagship fried chicken Jollibee chain. This year, the company will invest from 18 billion pesos to 21 billion pesos ($312 million to $364 million) for 700 to 800 new stores, which would bring its total network above 10,000 outlets. “We’re not in all 50 states [in the U.S.]. We’re in only maybe 15 states,” Richard Shin, the company’s chief financial and risk officer, told reporters on Tuesday while briefing them on last year’s earnings, referring to its North American expansion strategy. The Jollibee chain opened its first North American store in Daly City, California, in 1998. At the end of 2024, it had 103 locations in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, the company had 266 North American restaurants under other brands. To accelerate the expansion, Jollibee will expand the franchising of its brands in the U.S., according to the company. Franchisees will be able to locate eateries in stand-alone buildings, strip malls, airports or transit hubs. “Our growth model for capital, again, is shifting to the franchise model,” Shin said. “We’ll have less and less capex [capital expenditure] requirements for store expansions.” Shin said Jollibee sees an opportunity in a North American market where Kentucky Fried Chicken, he noted, has 8,000 locations. “So you could imagine the room for growth for a brand like Jollibee,” he said, “which consistently gets voted by consumers two years in a row, 2023 and 2024, as the best fried chicken.” For the flagship fried chicken chain, “Jollibee’s projected expansion goal is to have 350 stores across both the U.S. and Canada in the next couple of years,” the company said earlier this month in a news statement when it announced a new franchising partnership in the U.S. The company’s net profit for 2024 grew 17.7% to 10.3 billion pesos, anchored by a double-digit revenue increase driven by store expansions, including acquisitions. In its earnings guidance, Jollibee indicated it expects 8% to 12% growth this year in “system wide sales” — all sales to consumers by company-owned and franchised stores. Jollibee also indicated it is shooting for its store network to grow as much as 8%. The food giant has been aggressive in acquiring brands , scooping up South Korean chain Compose Coffee in August, taking full ownership of Hong Kong-based restaurant chain Tim Ho Wan and acquiring Taiwanese wellness soup brand Moon Moon. Jollibee also has ownership stakes in Chinese fast-food chain Yonghe King, and American brands Smashburger and The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf. Additional reporting by Ella Hermonio.",

The prosecutors can appeal the ruling, which would bring the case to the Supreme Court, South Korea’s highest legal body. Speaking outside the court after the decision was announced, Lee Jae-myung&nbsp;thanked the court for what he called a “proper ruling.” The charges against Lee stem from remarks he made while running in his party’s presidential primary in 2021 when he claimed to have been unacquainted with a key figure in a property development scandal. The scandal involved a redevelopment project in the city of Seongnam, where Lee was mayor. Prosecutors argue that Lee was lying about his relationship with businessman Kim Moon-ki to hide his own culpability in the property deal. Immediately after the court’s decision was announced, Kweon&nbsp;Seong-dong, the leader of the ruling People Power Party, called verdict “regretful” and urged the Supreme Court to quickly rule&nbsp;on the case.&nbsp; Lee, a lawyer by training and veteran politician, lost the 2022 presidential election to now-impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol by the narrowest margin in South Korea’s democratic history. A protester in Seoul holds a sign calling for opposition leader Lee Jae-myung to be arrested on Dec. 31, 2024. &nbsp; © Reuters Yoon, a bitter rival of Lee’s, is awaiting a Constitutional Court verdict on his December impeachment on charges of leading an insurrection. Lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon following his attempt in early December to institute martial law, a measure he claimed was necessary to protect South Korea from “anti-state forces” in the opposition. The measure was quickly voted down in the National Assembly, but the attempt sparked a political crisis that is still unfolding months later. The Constitutional Court concluded hearings on Yoon’s case late last month and is expected to render its verdict within days, although no official date has been announced. If the court finds Yoon not guilty, he will be immediately restored to office. If it finds him guilty, a snap election will take place within 60 days. Data released last week by pollster Gallup Korea showed Lee to be the leading choice among candidates that could run in the next presidential election. Lee had 36% of support, far ahead of the No. 2 prospective contender, conservative Labor Minister Kim Moon-soo .",

    "description": "MUFG and SMBC must reaffirm their net-zero commitments and translate these pledges into actionable policies and targets aligned with climate science and the Paris Agreement. (Source photos by Yuki Nakao) MUFG and SMBC's UN climate exit signals a troubling retreat from sustainability Eri Watanabe Eri Watanabe March 26, 2025 17:05 JST Eri Watanabe is a senior Japan energy finance campaigner at Market Forces, a clean energy finance advocacy group working across Asia and Australia. Japan’s two largest banks, MUFG and SMBC, recently followed the biggest U.S. and Canadian banks in withdrawing from the United Nations-led Net-Zero Banking Alliance. These moves put global banking and investor climate initiatives under threat and place secure economies at risk. Japan’s major banks have a duty to hold firm on their net-zero commitments and accelerate efforts to minimize climate risk. The NZBA is rallying its 130 member banks, which hold $49 trillion in assets, to stay the course. Most of Asia’s banks, including those in Singapore and Malaysia, Japan’s Mizuho and Australia’s biggest four this year have held firm on their commitments to achieving net zero and retaining their NZBA membership. It’s critical that Asia’s banks avoid short-term political and financial expediency, which risks undermining their long-standing commitments to climate goals and sustainability. The transition to a net-zero economy is supercharging, and banks need to recognize that there is no turning back. To avoid losing more members, the NZBA is giving serious consideration to watering down its climate ambitions. Yet for many banks, including those jumping ship, the NZBA has enabled them to engage in greenwashing and window dressing by failing to hold coal, oil and gas companies as well as other high emitting customers to account. MUFG joined NZBA in June 2021 as the first member bank from Japan , and led the alliance’s steering group. In MUFG’s 2024-2026 management plan, the bank pledges to “drive social and environmental progress,” including “achievement of a carbon neutral society.” SMBC has long positioned itself as a green bank and in its 2023-2025 medium-term management plan highlighted its commitment to decarbonization and addressing global inequalities. However, alongside these commitments, MUFG and SMBC have funded oil and gas developments, joining the “dirty dozen” top 12-ranked global financiers of fossil fuels, according to a Banking on Climate Chaos report. The next litmus test for MUFG, SMBC and Mizuho will be whether they can effectively implement measures to support the genuine transition of high-emitting customers. Leading banks in Europe and Australia have demonstrated that financing companies with credible transition plans is core to managing climate and associated financial risks. Last year around one in four investors and shareholders called on Japan’s megabanks to improve disclosure on their assessments of the climate transition plans of their customers. Fortunately, the U.S.-led revolt against corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibilities has not yet imposed a significant impact on Asian economies. But the risk of a broader shock looms as MUFG, SMBC, Nomura and Norinchukin have jumped on the bandwagon, shunning climate science. People walk through water at a flooded area affected by rising sea levels and land subsidence in North Jakarta, Indonesia, on&nbsp;Nov. 20, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp; © Reuters If Japan’s banks fail to adhere to their net-zero commitments and continue supporting companies expanding oil, gas and coal businesses, they jeopardize their bottom lines, their reputations and send damaging signals to the markets they wish to serve. There is overwhelming evidence of immense economic risks associated with climate change. In 25 years, extreme heat, rain and flooding will cause $38 trillion in annual damages, according to the Potsdam Institute. The warning bells must be ringing loud and clear for Japanese banks. A global network of 141 central banks and regulators recently estimated that under current climate targets and policies, the Japanese economy could lose about $9.2 trillion by 2050. Conversely, if private and government leaders unite around the world to fully implement a transition to net-zero emissions by mid-century, by 2070 the global economy could win a $43 trillion windfall and 3.8% more economic growth, according to Deloitte research. Fossil fuels are like a sinking ship. Renewable energy including wind and solar are already undercutting new coal and gas plants on production costs almost everywhere in the world. The economics of coal, oil and gas expansion don’t stack up and more investors are recognizing this cold hard truth. In light of the mounting evidence and dire warnings, the financial sector must not shy away from its role as a catalyst for change and genuinely enable the transition to a net-zero economy. Despite withdrawing from the NZBA, MUFG, SMBC, Nomura and Norinchukin must reaffirm their net-zero commitments and translate these pledges into actionable policies and targets aligned with climate science and the Paris Agreement. Another test for the Japanese megabanks is whether they will continue providing finance for one of the biggest and most polluting liquified natural gas projects ever planned, Papua LNG. MUFG has acted as a financial advisor, yet the Papua New Guinea project faces severe financial, political and legal risks. So far, the Asian Development Bank, France’s biggest bank BNP Paribas, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and 10 other lenders have confirmed they will not lend to Papua LNG. Concerns extend beyond this project, especially as all three Japanese megabanks stand out among the top 10 global banks for their financing of LNG projects. Proponents of LNG have long touted the gas as a cleaner fuel compared to coal. Yet exported LNG emits 33% more greenhouse gases than coal when taking into account transport and polluting methane emissions according to findings published in Energy Science and Engineering. Japan’s obsession with LNG threatens its energy security and economic viability due to a big surplus and decreasing demand. A push to resell excess LNG imports and construct LNG power plants across Asia risks locking developing nations into a costly fossil fuel-dependent future, undermining the shift to affordable renewable energy and worsening climate change impacts. The onus is on Japan’s megabanks to determine their role in the transition to a sustainable economy. The banks’ future viability depends on their commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainable practices, which will dictate their long-term financial success in an evolving global economy and a warming planet.",

    "description": "BYD's first hybrid pickup truck in Thailand, the Shark 6, is displayed at the motor show. (Photo by Yuki Kohara)&nbsp; Bangkok auto show sees more than 50 brands on display APORNRATH PHOONPHONGPHIPHAT APORNRATH PHOONPHONGPHIPHAT March 26, 2025 15:24 JST Updated on March 26, 2025 16:27 JST BANGKOK — The 46th&nbsp;Bangkok International Motor Show opened to the public on Wednesday, with more than 50 brands from around the world participating and the offerings on display focusing more on hybrid models rather than EVs. As has been the case in recent years, Chinese manufacturers are taking center stage at the event. EV giant BYD unveiled its latest plug-in hybrid pickup truck, the Shark 6 DMO, a four-wheel drive vehicle priced at 1.69 million baht ($49,000). It is BYD’s first HV pickup truck for sale in the kingdom. The company also introduced another plug-in hybrid, the Sealion 6, a large SUV priced at 899,900 baht. “All the new models that BYD launched today will be one of the highlights of this motor show and will also play a key role in driving the Thai auto market forward,” said Pratarnwong Phornprapha, CEO of Rever Automotive, which handles BYD’s sales and distribution in Thailand. SAIC Motor, which operates the MG brand, is launching both premium hybrid and EV models in a bid to appeal to all customer bases. One offering is the all-new MG3 hybrid plus, a fuel-saving sports sedan priced at just 579,900 baht. The Bangkok&nbsp;International Motor Show runs through April 6. (Photo by Yuki Kohara) Great Wall Motor, meanwhile, is showcasing large SUV models, with its hybrid version priced at 929,000 baht and plug-in hybrid at 1.049 million baht. Japan’s carmakers, which had a 70% share of the Thai market in 2024, are also focusing on hybrids. Toyota Motor is promoting seven hybrid models at the show, including versions of its Camry, Yaris and Corolla brands as well as for its luxury brands such as the Alphard and Vellfire. GWM Vehicle is displayed during&nbsp;Bangkok&nbsp;International Motor Show on March 24. (Photo by Yuki Kohara) “Hybrid models find a good market [in Thailand],” said Nutthorn Sinives, vice president (National Marketing) of Toyota Motor Thailand. “Although many people switched to EVs, certain groups prefer hybrids.” Another key Japanese player, Mitsubishi Motors, launched its XForce HEV hybrid model at the show, with carries a price tag ranging from 899,000 baht to 1.089 million baht. Hybrid sales in Thailand rose to 117,789 units in 2024, up 26% from 2023. Consumer demand is also growing for plug-in hybrids, which can be charged from a standard power outlet, with sales in the kingdom totaling 1,753 units in the first two months of this year, up 478% compared with the same period last year. In contrast, demand for EVs fell as oversupply has triggered a price war, leading people to hold back on purchases in hopes that manufacturers will cut prices in the future. Toyota Motor is promoting seven hybrid models at the show, including versions of its Camry, Yaris and Corolla brands. (Photo by Yuki Kohara)&nbsp; Sales of EVs came to 66,732 units in 2024, down 9.2% from the previous year. EV demand in the first two months of this year remained flat as sales fell 0.12% compared with the same period last year to 14,558 units. High household debt has seen banks apply more stringent loan assessments of late, making it harder for Thais to buy new cars. Thailand’s auto industry saw total car sales drop 26% to 572,675 units for the whole of 2024. This trend has continued into 2025, as total car sales for January and February dropped 9.53% compared with the same period of 2024, to 97,395 units, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). “We need to wait and see how many cars can be sold during the International Motor Show,” which runs from March 26 to April 6, said Surapong Paisitpattanapong, spokesperson for the FTI’s automotive industry club. Thailand’s total car production is also down, dropping 13.62% on the year to 115,487 units in February, while production in the first two months of 2025 dropped 19.29% to 222,590 units. “Considering factors such as driving range, charging time, spare parts prices, charging time and after-sales service, I think hybrids offer more flexibility than EVs,” Mek Srilomsak, a 34-year-old assistant professor at King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, told Nikkei Asia. “In addition, considering Thailand’s industrial sector, which includes many OEMs (original equipment manufacturing) for internal combustion engine parts, promoting hybrids could be a good compromise that benefits both consumers and the industry.”",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Pakistan-s-dispute-over-new-canal-project-threatens-political-coalition",
    "description": "Fishermen cast their&nbsp;nets into&nbsp;the Indus River in Pakistan on March 15.&nbsp; © Reuters Experts say $750m project is impractical and unsustainable Adnan Aamir ADNAN AAMIR March 26, 2025 14:15 JST ISLAMABAD — Growing concerns over a potential water crisis from the building of a new canal have sparked opposition across Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh, with the local assembly passing a resolution against it in mid-March. This has raised fear that the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which has Sindh as its stronghold, could leave the governing coalition of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over the issue. In February, the federal government launched an ambitious agriculture project, the Green Pakistan Initiative, to enhance food security through corporate farming, with the Pakistan army taking the lead. Under this initiative, six canals will be constructed, including one in the Cholistan desert. The government will invest $750 million to build the 176-kilometer-long canal to irrigate 1.2 million acres of barren lands in the desert within the Punjab province. The government claims that the Cholistan canal will use flood water for four months a year and river water from Punjab in the remaining months. River water flows downstream from the north in Punjab to Sindh province in the south. However, on March 13, the Sindh provincial assembly passed a resolution against the construction of this canal. Politicians and rights activists in Sindh allege that the new canal will ultimately eat up the share of water in their province, which was determined by the Water Apportionment Accord of 1991, an agreement between the provinces of the country. If less water flows from the Indus River into the Arabian Sea, there would likely be a big impact on the Indus River Delta, which is home to over a million people, animals and mangrove forests, said water rights activists. “Diverting more river flows away from the delta will hasten land erosion, which has significant environmental consequences as well as implications for migration from areas with rising tides coming in,” Erum Sattar, a lecturer who researches the Indus at Tufts University in the U.S., told Nikkei Asia. Shahab Usto, a civil rights lawyer based in Karachi, warns that water availability could decrease by 30% to 40% in the coming years. “In Sindh, where 70% of the economy depends on agriculture, the [new canal] project threatens livelihoods and can fuel unrest,” he said. “If this canal is built forcefully, without consensus, it could even push the country toward internal conflict.” Experts said that the plan to build a new canal to irrigate a barren desert is impractical and completely unsustainable. “ Punjab [government] insists that the Cholistan canal will function as a flood canal, but floods are unreliable. Since 2010, the Indus River system has not experienced any major floods,” Naseer Memon, a climate change consultant, told Nikkei. “In such a situation, with a huge water deficit already existing, there is simply no surplus water available to support large-scale corporate farming projects,” he added. A farmer sprays pesticide in a field near the&nbsp;Indus&nbsp;River&nbsp;in Pakistan. The Indus River Delta&nbsp;is home to over a million people, animals&nbsp;and mangrove forests. &nbsp; © Reuters Usto, the water rights lawyer, said that all hydrologists have opposed this canal project because it’s neither viable nor sustainable. “Even India’s Indira Gandhi Canal, just across the border from Pakistan’s Cholistan, failed under similar circumstances,” he said. There is also a question about the $750 million cost of this new canal project. “Given the government’s track record of not completing projects on time, alongside frequent time and cost overruns, the reliability of these cost estimates is highly questionable,” Hassan Abbas, a water expert based in Islamabad, told Nikkei. Rights activists in Sindh argue that the federal government initiated the canal project without seeking approval from Council of Common Interests (CCI), which is a constitutional body responsible for resolving inter-provincial disputes. Usto said that any dispute over water distribution should be taken to the CCI, which then takes actions to resolve it. Memon, the climate change consultant, said that the relationship between Sindh and the federal government is likely to be strained due to the canal controversy. “Sindh is the stronghold of the Pakistan People’s Party. If the federal government does not reverse its decision [on new canals], there is a strong possibility that the PPP may eventually part ways with the coalition government of Shehbaz Sharif,” Memon told Nikkei.

    "description": "The rupee touched a year-to-date high of 85.45 to the dollar on March 24. © Reuters South Asian currency rebounds after slumping to a record low in February SOUMYAJIT SAHA March 26, 2025 14:05 JST MUMBAI — The rupee has charged to its strongest position against the dollar this year , helped in part by dollar inflows into India and the return of foreign portfolio investors, though the risk of a setback from expected U.S. tariffs remains. The rupee is also this month’s best performing major Asian currency, rising over 2% in March as of Tuesday’s close, ahead of peers like the Singaporean dollar, Philippine peso and Malaysian ringgit. The currency’s rebound comes after it plumbed record lows in February due to slow domestic growth and foreign investors stepping away from Indian assets. On Monday, the rupee touched a year-to-date high of 85.45 to the dollar. On Tuesday and Wednesday, it fell slightly lower though it remained roughly 2.7% above the all-time low of 87.992 it recorded on Feb. 10. In March, the currency has been largely boosted by financial year-end inflows of dollar-denominated corporate profits, while a return of foreign capital into the wider market has also helped, Dhiraj Nim, forex strategist and economist at ANZ bank told Nikkei Asia. Indian companies often repatriate their dollar-based earnings in March. On Tuesday, foreign investors bought nearly $630 million worth of Indian equities, according to provisional data from the National Stock Exchange. That was on top of about $1.3 billion in foreign inflows into equities over the preceding three trading sessions. As for Indian bonds, foreign inflows so far this month have amounted to about $3 billion. The rampant buying comes after months of persistent selling by foreign portfolio managers, including a net withdrawal of about $4 billion from Indian equities in February. On Tuesday, Indian equities’ winning streak reached seven days. All the buying has erased the losses for the calendar year so far, and comes after over $1 trillion was erased from the value of the equity market since its September peak. The trough reflected weak corporate earnings and foreign capital outflows. Despite the recovery, analysts warn the next set of Trump tariffs, set to kick in on April 2, could impact the rupee. “If tariffs come to have a substantial economic impact,” ANZ’s Nim said, “I think the most natural course of action should be to let the rupee weaken, as that can absorb a part of that shock.” India was on a list of countries of “particular interest” to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative when it requested public comments on trade tariffs. “We estimate India would potentially lose about $6 billion (0.16% of GDP) in exports to the US at 10% broad tariffs, with this rising to about $31 billion at 25% tariffs,” brokerage Emkay Global said in a note on Tuesday. ANZ’s Nim said India’s central bank has allowed the rupee to considerably appreciate, potentially creating “headroom” for depreciation. “If tariffs hit and [the currency] depreciates to 87.5, it is still familiar territory,” he said. “But if it goes beyond 88 or 89, then imported inflation becomes something to worry about. … The RBI rule of thumb is a 5% depreciation (in the rupee) leads to a 35 basis point bump in inflation.”",

Dubbed DeepSeek-V3-0324, the updated model has improved significantly over its predecessor, especially in advanced math and coding, according to the company’s post on Hugging Face, a U.S. open-source AI community. Benchmark tests show DeepSeek’s latest model outperforms GPT-4.5 in coding and mathematical reasoning, while GPT-4.5 remains the strongest overall in knowledge-based tasks. The new V3 model further optimizes the writing level of Chinese writing tasks based on its R1 model, with a particular focus on improving the content quality of medium-to-long-form text creation, according to DeepSeek. “From a purely technical perspective, there isn’t a major breakthrough in DeepSeek’s update compared to its previous versions, and I think all models will continue to update rapidly, but the impact won’t be as significant as the leap from zero to one,” said Eugene Lee, a Hong Kong-based AI engineer. “However, as an open-source model, DeepSeek’s updated capabilities matching GPT-4.5 are relatively rare,” he said. After taking the tech world by storm in January with its cheap-to-train but robust AI model, DeepSeek has become the poster child for Chinese AI ingenuity. The startup’s meteoric rise has rekindled optimism about Chinese innovation and bolstered Beijing’s commitment to supporting its tech players. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma were among the Chinese tech entrepreneurs who attended a high-profile gathering with Chinese President Xi Jinping last month, further fueling a tech market rally around China’s AI advancement. The Hang Seng Tech Index has surged around 25% since the start of the year.",

Han Duck-soo said Wednesday that 18 people, including four firefighters, have died in the fires and 23,000 people were evacuated from their homes. He added that 244 wildfires have occurred in South Korea this year, 2.4 times more than by the same time last year. Also, 17,000 hectares of woodland and 209 locations, such as homes and factories, have been destroyed. To combat the fires, Han said 4,652 personnel have been activated, as well as 128 helicopters, with additional support from the U.S. military stationed in South Korea. “We are fighting the worst wildfires in history using all the manpower and equipment that we can mobilize but the situation is dire,” Han said, according to a release from his office. Han expressed thanks to all emergency personnel and government workers who are engaged in battling and dealing with the fallout from the blazes. “The whole nation is watching as you work to protect your hometowns, your families and your neighbors,” he said. Wildfires tend to occur in the spring in South Korea, a time of strong winds and dry weather conditions. Officials have not pinpointed a cause of this year’s exceptionally severe blazes, but Han said Wednesday that fires lit by locals to incinerate waste are the main cause of wildfires. This week’s weather forecast is for continued dry conditions and only a low chance of rain. The disaster is taking place at a time of political chaos in South Korea, created by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s botched attempt at instituting emergency martial law in early December. Yoon is currently awaiting a Constitutional Court verdict that will either formally remove or return him to office. He was impeached in December and a verdict in his case has been hotly anticipated for weeks, since the court held its final hearing in his case in late February. Han resumed duties as acting president on Monday when the same court that will rule on Yoon’s fate decided to reject his impeachment and restore him to office. Opposition lawmakers voted to impeach Han in December, after he was named acting leader following Yoon’s impeachment.",

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Commerce Department has added 80 organizations to the Entity List for actions “contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy.” The additions to the blacklist include entities from the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Iran and even Taiwan, but most are either Chinese or linked to China. BIS, in an announcement released Tuesday in Washington, identified a key objective of preventing the Chinese Communist Party from gaining the ability to “acquire and develop high-performance and exascale computing capabilities, as well as quantum technologies, for military applications.” Exascale computing is the latest supercomputer technology enabling further development of AI. It describes computing at speeds of at least 1 exaflop, or 1 quintillion floating-point calculations per second. Another goal was to “impede China’s development of its hypersonic weapons program,” essentially, weapons that travel five times the speed of sound or faster and boast enhanced maneuverability to evade defenses. Military vehicles carrying DF-17 hypersonic missiles&nbsp;drive past Beijing’s Tiananmen Square during a National Day parade in October 2019. &nbsp; © Reuters “American technology should never be used against the American people,” Jeffrey I. Kessler, undersecretary for industry and security at the Commerce Department, said in the statement. He stressed that the Trump administration is “sending a clear, resounding message” to safeguard national security “by preventing U.S. technologies and goods from being misused for high-performance computing, hypersonic missiles, military aircraft training, and UAVs that threaten our national security.” The Commerce Department also listed the Test Flying Academy of South Africa (TFASA) to prevent the use of “U.S. items to train Chinese military forces.” Apart from China, the expanded list is also intended to “disrupt Iran’s procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related defense items.” Kessler added that the Entity List is “one of many powerful tools at our disposal to identify and cut off foreign adversaries seeking to exploit American technology for malign purposes.” China had not responded to the U.S. announcement as of publication time.",

    "description": "Then-former President Donald Trump speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in July&nbsp;2024, in Nashville, Tennessee. © AP Venture raises $550m from selling separate digital token March 26, 2025 10:27 JST LONDON (Reuters) — Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto venture will launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin, it said in a statement on Tuesday, after raising more than half a billion dollars from selling a separate digital token. The stablecoin, called USD1, will be fully backed by U.S. Treasuries, dollars and other cash equivalents and is designed to keep a value of $1, World Liberty said in the statement. Dollar-pegged stablecoins such as Tether and USDC have ballooned in recent years and now act as a key cog in the multi-trillion dollar crypto trading industry, helping move funds between different cryptocurrencies or into regular cash. Stablecoins in circulation currently total over $237 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. The tokens have become lucrative for their issuers in recent years as interest rates spiked. Tether, the issuer of the world’s biggest stablecoin, made over $13 billion in profits last year. Zach Witkoff, World Liberty’s co-founder, said “sovereign investors and major institutions” would be able to integrate USD1 “into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions.” USD1 will be “fully backed by a reserve portfolio audited regularly by a third-party accounting firm,” World Liberty said, without giving details of the accounting firm, or the date of its launch. Founded two months before his victory in the U.S. presidential election, World Liberty’s creation was announced by Trump, his three sons and the wealthy real estate businessman Steve Witkoff, who is the father of Zach and now Trump’s Middle East envoy. Trump, who campaigned on promises to be a “crypto president,” has pledged to overhaul U.S. rules on crypto and reverse a crackdown on the sector that took place under former President Joe Biden. His crypto business interests, which include a so-called meme coin launched in January, have drawn criticism from government ethics experts and political opponents over potential conflicts of interest. The World Liberty venture, which aims to allow people to access financial services without intermediaries like banks, said last week it has raised $550 million selling a crypto coin known as $WLFI. Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of New York payments infrastructure firm Borderless.xyz said USD1 would face stiff competition from incumbents such as Tether and U.S. firm Circle, the issuer of USDC. “While launching a stablecoin is easy, building an ecosystem that adopts it is a far harder task,” he said. “Is the President competing with other American businesses or will they find ways to partner?” USD1’s reserves will be held in custody by California-based BitGo, World Liberty said. BitGo’s prime brokerage service will support USD1 by “providing institutional clients with access to deep liquidity and trading,” it added. USD1 will be launched on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains – digital ledgers that underpin the movement of crypto coins. World Liberty plans to launch USD1 on other blockchains in the future, it added. Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, launched its so-called Smart Chain in 2020. It is the world’s fourth-largest blockchain by the value of assets held on it, according to CoinGecko. Binance’s founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao was last year sentenced to four months in a U.S. prison, after pleading guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering. Binance paid a $4.3 billion fine after U.S. prosecutors said it had welcomed criminals and failed to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups. A spokesperson for Binance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about how the partnership came about.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Indonesia-s-Danantara-targets-8bn-in-dividends-from-state-owned-companies",
    "description": "Pandu Patria Sjahrir, chief investment officer of Danantara, told Nikkei Asia that one of the priorities of Indonesia's new sovereign wealth fund is to professionalize the country's state-owned enterprises. (Photo by Dimas Ardian) CIO says sovereign wealth fund needs to 'explain our intentions' to skeptical investors ISMI DAMAYANTI March 26, 2025 10:16 JST JAKARTA — Indonesia’s four-week-old sovereign wealth fund&nbsp;will seek to earn $8 billion a year —&nbsp;a 60% increase on the current level — in dividends from state-owned enterprises (SOEs), according to its chief investment officer. As of this week, the fund, Daya Anagata Nusantara, or Danantara, oversees 47 SOEs with assets of some $900 billion that gave the government a total of $5.1 billion in dividends in 2024. “Every year, we [will aim to] receive dividends of at least $8 billion,” Pandu Patria Sjahrir told Nikkei Asia in an interview when asked about the fund’s target. He added, without giving specifics,&nbsp;that the longer-term goal would be to generate even greater returns. He also did not give details about when&nbsp;the extra dividend revenue would be generated or how – except through making “high-return” investments and professionalizing the SOEs, partly by making them less political.&nbsp; Sjahrir explained that Danantara will function as a super holding company, overseeing investment strategies for SOEs. “Think of us as a financier, we’re investors who invest in projects and can collaborate with operational partners,” he said. Dividends from SOEs would be reinvested while ensuring returns from these initiatives are allocated to finance government programs. “I imagine that in five years, we could have $40 billion to invest in the market,” he predicted. The optimism contrasts with the current market uncertainty about Danantara and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s broader economic agenda. Indonesia’s benchmark equity index is down 20% since Prabowo was inaugurated five months ago, with SOEs including Bank Mandiri and Bank Rakyat Indonesia among the biggest losers. The rupiah, meanwhile, has&nbsp;been one of the&nbsp;worst performing emerging market currencies this year, falling more than 3%. On Tuesday it hit its lowest level against the dollar since June 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Sjahrir responded to this by saying that one of his primary roles is to engage with investors to build confidence and clarity about the fund’s direction. “After we explain Danantara to investors, they get excited. This is such a big change [that] disrupts the&nbsp;status quo, which leads to people thinking that there’s high uncertainty. So our job is to explain our intentions,” he said. According to Sjahrir, Danantara will follow a prudent risk management approach. “We have to make money … after that, we also want to bring in partners that add value, such as technology and knowledge —&nbsp;both would be even better,” he said, adding that investments will average around $500 million and focus on Indonesia. “We’re a very large country, and we will be investing inward, focusing on growing our own economy.” “This differs from INA, which is more likely to go with smaller projects with deal sizes from $50 million to $300 million,” he said, referring to Indonesia’s other sovereign wealth fund, the Indonesia Investment Authority, which was created in 2020. Sjahrir also stressed that Danantara will remain separate from INA and allow private investors to co-invest alongside it. “This is important because we want the private sector to invest with us.” Danantara is said to be focusing on sectors aligned with government priorities to boost domestic investment, including downstream industries, energy security, food security&nbsp;and digital infrastructure. On Monday it announced 18 people who would join its management, supervisory board and steering committee, including former Thai Prime&nbsp;Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, American billionaire Ray Dalio, Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs and a former CEO of nickel miner Vale Indonesia, Febriany Eddy. American billionaire hedge fund owner Ray Dalio, left,&nbsp;former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, center,&nbsp;and U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs are among the high-profile global figures who have been appointed to roles at Danantara. (Photos by Reuters and Getty Images) Prabowo last week inaugurated the Precious Metal Refinery, owned by Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of state-owned mining holding company Mind ID, which is now under Danantara’s management. Sjahrir said that similar projects would be among Danantara’s future investment priorities. “Those types of projects bring significant value to the country, economic benefits, technological advancements, and knowledge transfer, and we should aim to establish more,” he said. “Additionally, data centers are also very interesting … especially when data sovereignty comes into play, meaning that most of the data must remain within the country.” One of Danantara’s key objectives, Sjahrir explained, is to professionalize the SOEs.&nbsp;“That’s probably the most important, because [SOEs] can behave like a full economic actor, not a state actor,” he said.&nbsp; This would involve making them less political. “That’s always been the key issue with state owned enterprises is that the mix of politics and the business are too strongly intertwined,” Sjahrir said. “We’re hoping with Danantara, we can separate and minimize the political issue and focus more on the corporate.” Additionally, Danantara is intending to redirect SOE dividends from the state budget into an investment fund, where they can be managed for long-term economic growth and value creation, rather than being immediately spent by the government. “This way, the money [goes] for working capital of the state.” Sjahrir emphasized that these changes will be a major driver in shifting Indonesia&nbsp;from a consumption-based economy to an investment-driven economy. Currently, household consumption accounts for 53.7% of Indonesia’s gross domestic product, followed by investment and trade. The government aims to double investment growth from 5% to 10%, in order to achieve annual economic growth of 8%. However, Danantara has myriad&nbsp;challenges,&nbsp;with underperforming SOEs burdened by significant liabilities, including state-owned construction companies &nbsp;and PLN, the national electricity utility. “[For SOEs] that are&nbsp;not performing, we should ask why. Should they be consolidated so they get&nbsp;bigger and then they can have economies of scale?” For companies in severe financial distress, Danantara’s approach will be clear-cut, they will either be liquidated or sold. “If [an SOE is] already at some scale, then we scale it up or we should find strategic investors,” he said. Mohammad Faisal, executive director at the Center of Reform on Economics (CORE), said&nbsp;expecting significantly higher dividends from SOEs can&nbsp;only be realistic as a medium- to long-term strategy. “In the short term, Danantara should focus on improving SOE governance, particularly in state-owned construction companies,” he said. Faisal warned that pushing for higher dividends too quickly would be “very challenging” and could place a burden on currently profitable SOEs such as state-owned banks, telecom provider Telkom, and Pertamina, the main government oil and gas company. “The government has focused heavily on promoting the long-term benefits, but in the short term, many risks may be overlooked,” he said.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Trump-administration/Trump-team-scrambles-to-handle-fallout-from-Signal-chat-blunder",
    "description": "CIA Director John Ratcliffe, right, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testify before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington on March 25. © Reuters Intel officials say no classified info shared in group discussion March 26, 2025 09:04 JST WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Trump administration sought on Tuesday to contain the fallout after a magazine journalist disclosed he had been inadvertently included in a secret group discussion of highly sensitive war plans, while Democrats called on top officials to resign over the security incident. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe — both of whom were in the chat — testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that no classified material was shared in the group chat on Signal, an encrypted commercial messaging app. But Democratic senators voiced skepticism, noting that the journalist, Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about pending strikes against Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis, “including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.” Committee members said they planned — and Gabbard and Ratcliffe agreed to — an audit of the exchange. The Senate’s Republican majority leader, John Thune, said on Tuesday he expected the Senate Armed Services Committee to look in to Trump administration officials’ use of Signal. “It’s hard for me to believe that targets and timing and weapons would not have been classified,” Sen.&nbsp;Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said at the contentious hearing, which featured several sharp exchanges. Gabbard repeatedly referred questions about the exchange to Hegseth and the Department of Defense. She and Ratcliffe will face more lawmakers on Wednesday when the House of Representatives will hold its annual “Worldwide Threats” hearing. Democrats said they planned to discuss the Signal chat. The revelation on Monday drew outrage and disbelief among national security experts and prompted Democrats — and some of President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans — to call for an investigation of what they called a major security breach. “I am of the view that there ought to be resignations, starting with the national security adviser and the secretary of defense,” Democratic Sen.&nbsp;Ron Wyden of Oregon said at the hearing. But Trump voiced support for his national security team when questioned about the incident at a White House event on Tuesday with Michael Waltz, his national security adviser who mistakenly added Goldberg to the Signal discussion. Trump said the administration would look into the use of Signal. He said that he did not think Waltz should apologize but that he did not think Waltz and the team would be using Signal again soon. Sen.&nbsp;Jon Ossoff of Georgia appeared to grow frustrated after Ratcliffe answered “I don’t recall” to a series of questions about the content of the Signal chat. “Director Ratcliffe, surely you prepared for this hearing today,” Ossoff said. “You are part of a group of principals, senior echelons of the U.S. government, and now a widely publicized breach of sensitive information.” Some Republicans also wanted to know more. Sen.&nbsp;Todd Young said he would inquire during a closed hearing later on Tuesday. “It appears to me there are some unanswered questions,” the Indiana Republican said. A former U.S. official told Reuters that operational details for military actions are typically classified and known to only a few people at the Pentagon and such top secret information is usually kept on computers that use a separate network. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said on Monday that the chat group appeared to be authentic. Sensitive information is not supposed to be shared on commercial mobile phone apps. Additionally, Signal’s ability to erase conversations would violate laws governing the retention of government records. “This is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly toward classified information … of this administration,” the committee’s Democratic vice chairman, Mark Warner of Virginia, said. Accounts appearing to represent Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth, Ratcliffe, Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and senior National Security Council officials were assembled in the chat group, Goldberg wrote on Monday. Gabbard acknowledged that she had been abroad during the chat, although she declined to say whether she was using a private phone. The White House sought to play down the incident. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Goldberg of sensationalizing the story in a post on X. Also on X, White House communications director Steven Cheung dismissed as “faux outrage” the concern over the inclusion of a journalist in a war-planning chat. Hegseth told reporters on Monday that no one had texted war plans. Goldberg, appearing on CNN on Monday, called those comments “a lie.” It remained unclear why the officials chose to chat via Signal rather than the secure government channels typically used for sensitive discussions. Signal has a “stellar reputation and is widely used and trusted in the security community,” said Rocky Cole, whose cybersecurity firm iVerify helps protect smartphone users from hackers. “The risk of discussing highly sensitive national security information on Signal isn’t so much that Signal itself is insecure,” Cole added. “It’s the fact that nation-states threat actors have a demonstrated ability to remotely compromise the entire mobile phone itself. If the phone itself isn’t secure, all the Signal messages on that device can be read.” Republican Representative Don Bacon, a retired Air Force general who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters that Hegseth needed to take responsibility for the apparent breach, which he said put lives at risk. Asked about the claim that no classified details were shared, Bacon responded, “They ought to just be honest and own up to it.”",

    "title": "Sake segues into the 21st century",
    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/Sake-segues-into-the-21st-century",
    "description": "Bottles of sake line the wall behind the counter of a bar in Niigata prefecture, where small, independent sake breweries abound. (Photo&nbsp;by Kaori Shoji) Women and foreign drinkers are lapping up Japan's traditional 'old man's' drink KAORI SHOJI March 26, 2025 08:00 JST Sake, Japan’s traditional brewed alcohol drink, has been steadily trending overseas for some time. Sure, the painstakingly crafted rice wine gained a boost last year when the knowledge and skills required for traditional sake-making were recognized by UNESCO as an intangible world heritage asset. But even without the distinction, Japan had seen sake exports climbing steadily. In 2024, 31,000 kiloliters of sake were transported overseas, up by more than 100% from the previous year. That generated revenue of more than 43 billion yen ($287.9 million at current exchange rates), up 105.8%. Companies like Takara Holdings, an acclaimed sake maker with offshore offices the world over, have seized the opportunity to expand their North American operations and work with European food and beverage companies. The Japanese have long known that sake is their cuisine’s most reliable friend, having the capacity to perk up even the humblest of foodstuffs (dried squid and sesame seeds, anyone?). Now it seems the rest of the world is catching on. Having an authentic sake-plus-Japanese food experience is one of the top five reasons why inbound tourists head to Japan. Tokyo bars are crowded with foreign travelers staring at the sake descriptions on translated-to-English menus. For the Japanese however, the strokes on the canvas are less bold. According to a survey conducted by a sake maker in Yamagata prefecture, young people in their 20s and 30s say that sake is not their drink, preferring fizzy cocktails. But sake has found a wider fan base among Japanese women. Compared with 2017, the number of women who prefer sake has doubled, according to PR Times, a Japanese business information provider. These women are in their mid-30s or older, and are discerning drinkers who have a favorite sake region and kura (independent sake brewing house) making handmade brews. They frequent small, tucked-away sake bars and are knowledgeable about which drinks to pair with foods. Sake on tap at a standing&nbsp;bar: Insert a coin into the corresponding sake of choice and you will get one pour (approximately three sips). (Photos by Kaori Shoji) A friend who was once a French wine enthusiast now says: “The pandemic, low yen [exchange] rate and soaring energy costs have messed up the imported wine market [in Japan]. These days, I’m for sake. It fills me with a sense of well-being without the additional guilt and sticker shock.” She has a point. The best sake is brewed from a sustainable ecological process that uses just three ingredients: water, rice and a rice mold known as koji . Brewed with rice grains and water, the koji releases sugars that turn the liquid into sake. The process requires a pristine water supply, which in turn calls for a pure, industry-free environment. Most independent brewing houses are family businesses tucked away in mountainous rural areas. The brewers, known as tojis , are sake artisans, and the profession is hereditary. Some tojis can trace their family lineage back to the 17th century, and their brewing methods are kept under lock and key. “All this history is thrilling,” says my friend. “I used to avoid sake because it seemed like an old man’s drink. But it’s time to share in the joys.” She now uses sake-based cosmetics and swears that her sake moisturizer has made her skin more supple. Top: A&nbsp; toji (master brewer)&nbsp;spreads steamed rice on a table in a hot room where the rice is treated with a mold called koji &nbsp;in preparation for brewing sake. (Getty Images) Bottom: Sake-based face masks and hand cream. (Photos by Kaori Shoji) It is certainly true that tojis are known for their wrinkle-free hands — the reward for years of dedicated toil. In Niigata, a prefecture famed for its large number of independent brewing houses and the highest sake consumption rate in Japan, blemish-free skin is common. Another friend, who is a Niigata native, says his grandmother used sake on everything from bruises to depression. “Sake is the cure for 100 maladies,” he says. This friend is 51 but looks 20 years younger. But even the ancient, mythical world of sake is facing upheaval. Responding to the huge spike in offshore demand, major brewing companies have made the shift to digital production: Instead of relying on tojis’ experienced hands and sensibilities, computers control and supervise the brewing process. Other companies seem to be prioritizing foreign consumers over Japanese. In 2023 the luxury sake brand Dassai made headlines by opening a brewery in New York state’s Hudson River Valley. When the company’s president moved there too, sake purists posted their disappointment on social media. “Sake is uniquely Japanese and belongs right here in Japan,” said one disappointed traditionalist. My father, who hailed from Japan’s northeast, was a big sake drinker. During winter Sundays, he started the afternoon with an atsukan (hot sake). It was my job to heat it in a ceramic carafe, in water that was heated to 85 C for 2.5 minutes. Ideally, the atsukan should be hitohada (skin temperature), but in our icy kitchen my hands often felt too cold to offer a reference point. Dassai Blue 23, a high-end sake brewed in New York state’s Hudson River Valley, was served at&nbsp;the Academy&nbsp;Awards after-party in Los Angeles in&nbsp;February.&nbsp; &nbsp; © Getty Images When finished, the atsukan would be carried by my mother to my father, waiting at the table. He would take a tiny ochoko sake cup into his hand, and she would pour the drink for him. The first sip, he said, was the most important — it indicated whether the sake was heated properly. As a matter of course, I grew up resenting sake because of this rigmarole. When I learned that there was an electric sake heater on sale at a nearby appliance store I asked my father to get one, but he refused. “The atsukan wouldn’t taste the same in an electric heater,” he said. “In a few more years you’ll understand the difference.” Now I spend winter weekends with my own heated sake, which I make in a ceramic carafe. Much as I hate to admit it, I do understand the difference. My family and friends say that I could get a job anytime in a sake bar. There are some things that humans do better than machines, and the atsukan ritual is one of them. Kaori Shoji is a contributing writer.",

    "description": "Yutaka Ofuku, left, who heads a machine parts maker in Osaka, oversees the work of his chosen successor, Vietnamese factory manager Bui Quoc Viet. (Photo by Arisa Moriyama) Immigrants may make up 10% of population by 2040s, forecast shows EUGENE LANG March 26, 2025 07:11 JST TOKYO — The owner of a machine parts maker in Osaka faced the prospect of the end of his seven-decade-old company. The small local manufacturer has big customers, including tractor maker Kubota, giving it solid earnings. But 68-year-old Yutaka Ofuku had no successor lined up, nor could he find a buyer he could trust. He was saved from this predicament by a Vietnamese employee: factory manager Bui Quoc Viet, who had joined the company 11 years earlier. The 38-year-old Bui had intended to eventually return to his home country and start his own business. He said he decided to succeed Ofuku instead “after seeing how troubled the president was.” “We won’t have to cause problems for our customers,” a relieved Ofuku said. Ofuku’s plight shows how important foreign talent has become even to the top ranks of Japanese companies as the country’s population ages. A Teikoku Databank survey found that 52% of businesses do not have a successor or have yet to decide on one. Even with the weak yen making Japan less attractive for employment, the country had a record 2.3 million foreign workers at the end of October. The Japan Research Institute has estimated that foreigners could make up more than 10% of the population as soon as the 2040s. The share could grow as high as 20% to 30% in Tokyo and Osaka, as immigrant populations worldwide tend to be concentrated in cities. Without foreign workers, a future is possible where damaged roads and bridges are left unrepaired and stores cannot be stocked daily. The Japan International Cooperation Agency predicts that 6.88 million foreign workers, triple the current number, will be needed in 2040. Money Forward, a provider of cloud-based accounting software, is ahead of the curve, with around 30% of its engineers in Japan hailing from outside the country. Although English is the official language in the engineering department, the company began providing introductory Japanese lessons in 2025 to help employees struggling to communicate at work or in their daily lives. Japanese employees, meanwhile, learn to speak a simpler version of Japanese that avoids complicated expressions, providing a compromise that helps build relationships. In Germany, where 18% of the population is foreign-born, the far-right Alternative for Germany party placed second in February’s general election on a platform opposed to mass immigration. But Japan, with its shrinking labor pool, is in a different position, argued Yu Korekawa of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. “There won’t be competition with foreigners for jobs,” Korekawa said. Rather, the priority will be working together with foreigners to ensure that society can continue on. While more foreigners are choosing Japan, the country faces competition from other work destinations. Last summer, a technical intern trainee from the Philippines who was working in Japan moved to Canada. “We are seeing an increasing number of people moving to countries with higher wages after acquiring skills here,” said the head of a human resources company. “Japan is becoming a steppingstone.”",

    "description": "The Bank of Japan has so far avoided stepping in to curb rising long-term government bond yields. (Photo by Akira Kodaka) Market watchers see room for further rise toward Tokyo's assumed debt-service rate Nikkei staff writers March 26, 2025 07:00 JST TOKYO — The Bank of Japan is taking a wait-and-see approach as yields on long-term Japanese government bonds rise, spurring commercial banks to follow suit while fueling concern in the Finance Ministry over an increase in debt-servicing costs. The BOJ opted against bond-buying operations as yields climbed after it raised interest rates at its January policy board meeting . Yields have risen further since, reaching a 16-year high of 1.57% for the 10-year JGBs this month, as investors steer clear of buying bonds . “The ceiling for rate hikes is a long way off,” said an executive at a major bank. “We can’t buy when we know that the policy rate will rise.” Market watchers are also mindful that long-term yields remain well below the Japanese government’s assumed interest rate for debt servicing costs, which was set at 2% in the fiscal 2025 draft budget. Though a BOJ insider said the central bank does not make policy decisions with that rate in mind, some investors see it essentially serving as an upper bound. Yields could rise faster than the Finance Ministry expects. Calculations published by the ministry in January used an assumed interest rate of 2.2% for fiscal 2026, working out to 12 trillion yen ($80 billion) in interest payments. But some in the ministry have begun to say that 3% would not be out of the question if current trends continue, which could affect the rest of the budget drafting process and risk a further deterioration in government finances. Japan’s ratio of government debt to gross domestic product exceeded 250% between 2020 and 2024, according to the Finance Ministry — the highest among the Group of Seven economies. A country’s finances worsen when the average nominal interest rate on outstanding government debt surpasses the nominal economic growth rate, as was largely the case for Japan in the two decades through fiscal 2010. It could face continued challenges given that interest rates are trending up. Overseas ratings agencies are paying closer attention to the risk of Japan’s fiscal position deteriorating or yields rising sharply. JGBs look unlikely to face a downgrade anytime soon. But if that did happen, fundraising would become more costly for Japanese banks and other businesses, with serious knock-on effects for economic activity. The rise in long-term yields is hitting regional banks, whose unrealized losses on domestic bonds totaled 1.96 trillion yen at the end of 2024, up about 520 billion yen from three months earlier. These banks are expected to buy new bonds when the next fiscal year begins in April, but may face the risk of more paper losses depending on how yields move. To reduce its risk of future losses, Fukuoka Financial Group shortened the average duration on its yen-denominated bond holdings to 2.86 years, from 3.59 years a year earlier. Other financial institutions are increasingly holding government bonds to maturity, meaning their book value does not need to be updated as their market valuation changes. Banks’ “skill at managing [bond] duration will be tested,” Tetsuya Akino, chairman of the Regional Banks Association of Japan, said in a news conference this month. BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda in February told parliament that the central bank would “flexibly increase government-bond-buying operations in extraordinary circumstances, such as a drastic increase in long-term yields.” The bank uses fixed-rate bond-buying operations as an emergency tool, and every rise in long-term yields brings renewed speculation that they could be brought back into play. But for the most part, BOJ officials have stayed silent out of concern that any comments could signal a return of the bank’s yield curve control policy, which sought to keep JGB yields within a specific range.",

    "description": "Pressure from the U.S. government and&nbsp;clients is pulling TSMC to expand more and more in America.&nbsp;(Illustration by Yoshiko Kawano) Pressure on Taiwan mounts amid Washington's concerns over China's aggression CHENG TING-FANG and LAULY LI March 26, 2025 06:00 JST TAIPEI — When TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei stood next to U.S. President Donald Trump early this month and announced the world’s biggest chipmaker would be investing an additional $100 billion to build five more advanced chip facilities and an R&amp;D center on American soil, many back home in Taiwan were worried about what it would mean economically and politically for the island. Taiwan has long taken a measure of comfort in its “Silicon shield,” the idea that its chip economy — the second largest in the world — makes it too important for the U.S. not to defend it should China ever invade. But the U.S. is now home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s first cutting-edge plant overseas, which went into production in Arizona late last year, with some 3,000 employees on site. The chip titan is now busy installing clean room facilities at a second, more advanced plant in the state that will start pilot production by next year. And — Nikkei Asia can report for the first time — construction on a third Arizona plant is slated to begin this year. TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei, center,&nbsp;announces the chipmaker’s&nbsp;$100 billion additional investment in the U.S. at the White House on March 3. &nbsp; © Reuters Labor shortages, ballooning material costs and cultural challenges mean it took nearly fives years to complete its first U.S. plant, but TSMC now expects the additional factories to be built closer to its usual “Taiwan speed” of roughly two years, sources told Nikkei Asia. “After a painful learning curve, we have finally connected most of the dots and know which local construction contractors we can work with in building new plants,” a chip executive with direct knowledge of the matter said. TSMC told Nikkei Asia that it still plans to start operations at the second Arizona plant, for 3-nanometer chips, by 2028, and the third one, for 2-nm and better chips, before the end of the decade. But the accelerated pace of construction, on top of the company’s massive new investment plan, is potentially worrying for anyone fearful of Taiwan losing the crown jewel of its most important industry. TSMC declined to comment on whether it is aiming to accelerate its expansion in the U.S. to a “Taiwan speed.” Back home in Taiwan, TSMC engineers and suppliers are arguably even busier, working at a feverish pace to increase production at several cutting-edge 2-nm plants that are scheduled to begin production this year in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung. TSMC told Nikkei Asia that it is continuing to expand its 3-nm plant in Tainan. Next-generation A14 and A10 chips, which will mark the start of the so-called angstrom era, are under development at a “mother plant” near the company’s headquarters in Hsinchu. The company is also building advanced chip packaging facilities in Tainan, Chiayi and Miaoli to meet soaring demand from chip developers such as Nvidia, Amazon and Google in response to the boom in artificial intelligence. But this flurry of activity cannot disguise the fact TSMC and Taiwan more broadly are facing unprecedented levels of pressure from the U.S. and China. Over the past five years, as Washington has pressed for ever more onshoring of vital chip production, TSMC’s planned investment in the U.S. has ballooned from an initial $12 billion to $40 billion by 2022, then to $65 billion, in hopes of securing subsidies under the CHIPS Act, and finally to $165 billion — more than 10 times its original commitment and its largest overseas investment ever. &nbsp; Relations between Beijing and Taipei, meanwhile, have continued to deteriorate. The Chinese Communist Party-led China views democratic, self-governed Taiwan — which it has never ruled — as part of its territory and has not ruled out taking over the island by force. China has intensified its pressure through frequent live-fired military drills around the island in the past few years, while Taiwan’s newly elected President Lai Ching-te recently described China as a “ foreign hostile force ,” which Beijing reacted to by staging another military drill. Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te visits the Songshan airbase in Taipei on March 21. Lai drew Beijing’s ire when he described China as a “hostile foreign force.” &nbsp; © Reuters Multiple chip industry executives and market experts told Nikkei Asia that TSMC’s stepped-up investment in the U.S. stems mainly from fears among customers and in Washington that growing Chinese aggression could disrupt global chip supplies. Raymond Greene, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the U.S.’s de facto embassy, warned that if a catastrophic military conflict were to break out in the Taiwan Strait, an estimated 10% of global GDP could be affected, exceeding the impact of World War II. The Semiconductor Industry Association estimates disruptions at Taiwan’s contract chipmakers could cost electronic device makers $500 billion, while Rhodium Group predicts more than $2 trillion in economic activity would be at risk in such a conflict. TSMC’s Wei said at a private gathering at the National Taiwan University that if there were no TSMC, “The world’s economy would basically stall.” “There could be half of new cars that could not be shipped, with TSMC building some 50% of chips for car brakes. … There could be no new [generations] of smartphones, no [new] washing machines on sale if there were no TSMC,” he told the gathering. While Washington has been pressing TSMC to diversify production, American clients are now adding their voice to the calls. The chipmaker cannot afford to ignore them. Seventy percent of TSMC’s revenue last year came from U.S. chip developers such as Apple, Nvidia and Intel. By comparison, revenue from China fell to 11% in 2024 from, a peak of 20% in 2019, as Washington tightened restrictions on the country’s access to advanced tech. Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia said his company, a leading TSMC client for AI chips, aims to increase supply chain agility. “If we add onshore manufacturing by the end of this year, we should be quite good,” Huang said. Nikkei Asia was the first to report that Nvidia is among the first clients of TSMC’s Arizona plant. “The geopolitical environment is very different right now,” Charles Shi, a semiconductor analyst with investment bank Needham, told Nikkei Asia. “Even if China taking over Taiwan is a low-probability event, which still looks to be the case today, it is a high-impact event if it happens. Therefore, for national security reasons, the U.S. probably is highly motivated to reshape the semiconductor supply chain, even if just a little bit.” A former TSMC executive told Nikkei Asia that expanding production in the U.S. is now “inevitable.” “Previously, many of TSMC’s clients worried that unpredictable natural disasters, from earthquakes to droughts, could disrupt chip production. However, TSMC proved its resilience and convinced them otherwise. But with rising tensions and risks involving China, this is a request TSMC can no longer avoid,” the former executive said. Trump, in touting TSMC’s decision as a major U.S. victory, said the U.S. would play a big part in the semiconductor industry should conflict break out in the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. has about 11% of the global market in advanced chip production as of 2025, and that is set to double to 22% by 2030, research company TrendForce analyst Joanne Chiao estimates, while Taiwan’s share would drop from 71% to 58% over the same period. Mark Li, a veteran semiconductor analyst with Bernstein Research, estimates the additional $100 billion in investment from TSMC could raise the U.S. self-sufficiency rate for advanced chip production to 40% to 50% between 2030 and 2032. “It will take time,” Li said. “But U.S. self-sufficiency will also rise for more advanced technologies, as TSMC gradually narrows the [tech] gap between Taiwan and the U.S. as the chipmaker brings more capacity for newer nodes to the U.S. over time.” U.S. production will also become significant for TSMC. In a bullish scenario, where U.S. wafers command a 30% price premium over those made in Taiwan, TSMC’s revenue from its Arizona plants could potentially reach 30% of the company’s total revenue by 2032. “We don’t see the tides turning overnight,” a longtime chip equipment executive told Nikkei Asia. “But in five to 10 years, if U.S. investments fully materialize, they will certainly weaken Taiwan’s role as the world’s top hub for advanced chips. You can’t expect TSMC to replicate these costly facilities in two places.” Eddie Han, research director at Isaiah Research, said establishing a major R&amp;D center overseas to improve manufacturing brings the risk of indirect technology transfers, which could impact Taiwan’s semiconductor industry in the long term. “TSMC’s massive investments on advanced nodes in the U.S. would also magnetize the investment flows of Taiwanese chip ecosystem suppliers,” Han told Nikkei Asia. Lai Ming-Kuen, general manager of facility builder Acter, told Nikkei Asia that his company would consider participating in expanding the U.S. chip ecosystem, and added that shortages of sustainable electricity, water and land could be driving TSMC to invest abroad. “Electricity, in particular, remains a concern for Taiwan,” Lai said. Some market experts are slightly conservative about how quickly advanced chipmaking can be brought onshore in places beyond Asia and say capital spending does equate to output of viable semiconductors in the short run. Simon Woo, Asia Pacific technology research coordinator at BofA Global Research, said manufacturing yield and talent are two of the most important elements required to produce semiconductors outside of Asia. Yield is a key measure of production quality in chipmaking. “Starbucks coffee tastes the same everywhere, but semiconductor chip quality can vary market by market,” Woo told Nikkei Asia. “It’s like sashimi. … It tastes the best in Japan, and for a variety of reasons, but is very difficult to replicate in scale in other parts of the world.” TSMC’s plants in Arizona will become the chipmaker’s most important&nbsp;production hub outside of Taiwan. (Photo by Cheng Ting-Fang)&nbsp; Woo said that all chip industry CEOs need to be mindful of the business risks and impact on profitability when investing billions in different geographies, as advanced chipmaking is extremely complex. Governments, too, need to take an extremely long-term view, and cannot expect immediate results in advanced chip production. In Taiwan, TSMC’s massive U.S. investment has become a political saga, prompting officials from President Lai to various ministers to repeatedly assure the public it will not harm Taiwan’s competitiveness. A recent Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation survey revealed sharp divides: 43.8% are “happy” about TSMC’s additional $100 billion investment in the U.S., while 42.8% are “unhappy.” Over 60% believe it will boost U.S.-Taiwan ties, yet more than half still doubt the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China were to invade. TSMC declined to comment on the public opinion surveys. Konrad Young, professor at the National Taiwan University Graduate School of Advanced Technology, said Taiwan needs to moves beyond its silicon shield mindset and not tie the island’s strategic importance to just one company and one industry. “We should develop ‘multiple shields,’ so governments worldwide can see Taiwan’s other values,” said Young, a former TSMC R&amp;D director and former senior advisor at Intel.. Looking forward, there are still many bottlenecks looming for TSMC as it builds more plants in the U.S. Finding enough dedicated and disciplined engineers similar to those in Taiwan, and overcoming cultural differences and language barriers in management, are just a few hurdles, according to another longtime chip industry executive who said things will not be all rosy for the company. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The AI chipmaker is just one of TSMC’s clients pushing for more diversified production. (Photo courtesy of TSMC) The supply chain is incomplete and costs are much higher. Several chip chemical and material industry executives told Nikkei Asia that they expect it will take a very long time for their investments in the U.S. to be profitable. “The [chemical] investment could only be reaching a break-even point once TSMC’s six plants in Arizona are all in production … That’s still a long way to go,” a chip chemical industry executive with knowledge of the matter told Nikkei Asia. Bill Chiu, chairman of Gudeng Precision, a TSMC and Intel supplier, said the work efficiency and cost-effectiveness of U.S. chip production remain far from ideal, making many suppliers hesitant to rapidly increase their investments in the country. An executive with a water, chemical, and gas handling equipment provider was equally reserved about the massive expansion push in Arizona. “We were shocked by TSMC’s announcement to build another five plants in the U.S.,” the executive said. “The costs are really beyond our imagination. Take the expense of welders for example. We ended up paying 10 times more in Arizona than in Taiwan.” Steel prices are also rising due to tariff uncertainties, another executive said, which could push overall costs even higher. TSMC said it is continuing to expand 3-nanometer chip production in Tainan, Taiwan. (Photo by Cheng Ting-Fang) Peter Hanbury, a partner specializing in manufacturing at Bain, said the $100 billion in additional investment would move the needle on U.S. chip production, but that success hinges on future demand. “Chip plants take years to build. It is important to consider the long-term need for the facility. In the end, customer demand will drive need,” he said. But from the U.S. point of view, Taiwan is running out of time to stick with the status quo as Beijing steps up its aggressiveness. Some in the defense community, including a 2021 Pentagon report, are warning that China could seize Taiwan as early as 2027. U.S. Stratcom Commander Air Force Gen. Anthony J. Cotton reiterated the 2027 warning at a conference in Washington last week. G. Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, said the U.S. is considering the possibility of Beijing taking over Taiwan. “Taiwan is the ‘Hope Diamond’ of technology and of geopolitics. Both the U.S. and China hope they can control it. TSMC is so critical to the world’s technology,” Hutcheson said. Ironically, while some in Taiwan worry that TSMC’s U.S. expansion will leave the island vulnerable, Hutcheson argues that the opposite may be the case. “If all the production is in Taiwan, it becomes really ripe for attack, because China is currently being held up by U.S. sanctions. If there is more production outside of Taiwan, and balanced with global production in the U.S., Japan and Germany, what that does is lower the risk [of a Beijing attack],” he said. “If you take money out of the bank, there is no reason to rob it.”",

    "description": "The government hopes to direct foreign visitors to areas difficult to reach by land. (Photo by Kosaku Mimura) Government to offer financial support to build immigration, other facilities HIROFUMI KANAOKA March 26, 2025 05:52 JST TOKYO — Japan will soon publish guidelines for ports aimed at accepting more cruise ships nationwide, with the government looking to boost the postpandemic recovery in calls and attract overseas visitors to rural areas hard to reach by land. Cruise ship calls at Japanese ports reached 2,479 in 2024 — about 85% of the pre-COVID-19 peak of 2,930 in 2018, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Calls of vessels operated by overseas companies came to 1,923, reaching 96% of the prepandemic peak. Foreign visitors entering Japan on cruise ships numbered 1.44 million in 2024 — only around 60% of the pre-COVID peak. While the popularity of cruises around Japan for in-country tourists from Europe and the U.S. has risen, vessels coming from China have been sluggish because of that country’s economic slump, resulting in a gap in recovery between port calls and inbound passenger numbers. The industry is simultaneously trending toward smaller and larger vessels. Comparing port calls in 2014 and 2024, noticeable increases occurred in both small vessels with a capacity of fewer than 500 passengers and large ships with a capacity of more than 3,000. So in addition to setting up new ports of call, terminals that have already been accepting cruise ships need to expand their capacity. The ministry will create guidelines for port administrators nationwide as early as this March that specify the facilities and functions required to accept cruise ships. For example, waiting rooms will need to seat hundreds of people. For situations where a port that does not have a passenger terminal accepts a cruise ship, the guidelines will recommend setting up temporary structures and tents for shops and customs inspections. Recommendations will also be included on the number of immigration lanes required, depending on the number of passengers. Other guidelines will include installing roofing over pathways that passengers walk along after disembarking and the use of multilingual signs. The government will introduce examples of advanced ports in Japan and overseas, including Hamburg, Germany. The ministry will provide budgetary support to ports making changes recommended in the guidelines. Ports visited by foreign cruise ships reached 97 in 2024, up from 67 in 2019. New additions included the Okinawa prefecture island of Iheya and Sukumo, Kochi prefecture. Increasing the number of ports where cruise ships can call will also attract more visitors to areas difficult to reach by land. Ocean-going cruise passengers worldwide are expected to continue to increase and to reach 39.7 million in 2027 — up about 30% from 2019 — shows data from the Cruise Lines International Association. The number of beds on cruise ships will also continue to rise. Domestic operators are also growing. NYK Cruises, a unit of major maritime shipper Nippon Yusen, will launch its second active cruise ship, the Asuka III, in July. Tokyo Disney Resort operator Oriental Land will also enter the cruise ship business in fiscal 2028.",

    "description": "Bangladeshis work at Snowtex garment factory in Dhamrai, near Dhaka. © AP Services alone will struggle to make up for further deindustrialization Priyanka Kishore March 26, 2025 05:05 JST Priyanka Kishore is the founder and principal economist at research company Asia Decoded in Singapore. The outlook for Asia has predictably dimmed in an environment of heightened trade uncertainty. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s latest forecasts show global growth slipping to 3.1% in 2025 from 3.3% in 2024. This is not good news for Asia’s export-oriented economies. The challenge, however, is not merely cyclical. The transformation of globalization and shifts in global trade corridors are heralding deeper structural changes in Asia, notably a faster deindustrialization of its developing economies. This poses a dilemma for a region that has long relied on manufacturing exports to drive convergence to high-income countries. To be sure, the trend of “premature deindustrialization” is not new. Similar to other developing regions, the relative importance of manufacturing in developing Asia, as measured by share of employment or output, or both, has peaked at a fraction of the income levels observed in today’s advanced countries. That said, the decline in manufacturing has not been rapid. Unlike Brazil, where manufacturing’s share of gross domestic product has plummeted from more than 30% in the 1980s to around 12% in the 2000s, developing Asia’s early industrializers — Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia — still have reasonably large manufacturing bases, accounting for 20% or more of domestic output over the past decade. But now, pressures are mounting. An influx of cheap Chinese imports is threatening to put local industries out of business and accelerate developing Asia’s deindustrialization. China’s low prices stem partly from Beijing’s subsidies for products like solar panels, and overproduction in sectors like electric vehicles and steel. Yet, neither detracts from the highly competitive production processes that underpin China’s edge in manufacturing and leave competitors struggling. In Thailand, more than 3,000 companies have shuttered their doors since 2021, as higher production costs, poor competitiveness and a flood of Chinese goods have made domestic production unviable in many sectors. The Thai steel industry, which has been a major casualty, has seen its capacity utilization rate drop to 28%, according to an industry association. Similar trends are evident elsewhere. From Indonesia’s textiles to India’s toy makers, the region is dealing with factory closures and job losses. The problem is only likely to get worse. Faced with increasing trade barriers in the West and a consumer demand slump at home, China is likely to direct more of its low-priced exports toward Asian neighbors. So, what should these countries do? Should they accept China’s comparative advantage in manufacturing and pivot to a services-led growth model, or double down on industrialization? The answer lies in between. There is a reason why manufacturing-led growth is considered the gold standard of development. Traditionally, manufacturing’s ability to absorb large numbers of unskilled workers from agriculture and deliver strong productivity gains through capital accumulation, technology advancements and economies of scale couldn’t be replicated by labor-intensive services. But this is changing. Thanks to the information and communications technologies (ICT) revolution and the rapid adoption of digital channels by consumers and businesses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, services trade has expanded at a strong pace in recent years. Hence, services now mirror many of manufacturing’s characteristics. They are subject to greater competition, have the potential to scale and automate, and are capable of yielding higher productivity gains. A labourer works at a garment&nbsp;factory&nbsp;in Bangkok. &nbsp; © Reuters Two caveats, however, are in order. First, low-end services that are well placed to absorb unskilled and low-skilled labor have low productivity levels. While they could benefit from technological enhancements, it is hard to envisage them delivering similar productivity gains as low value-added manufacturing given their limited ability to automate and scale. Second, high-skilled offshorable services, which embody the high productivity potential of services, require advanced skills that most of developing Asia’s workforce doesn’t yet have. Despite rapid internet penetration and improved access to basic digital infrastructure, developing Asia suffers from large gaps in advanced digital technologies like 5G and levels of digital literacy. Even in India, where the digital economy has experienced exponential growth, gains are limited to a tiny fraction of the population. Barely 1% of the labor force is directly employed by the highly productive ICT services sector. This limits services’ ability to be developing Asia’s growth engine for now. The region must first invest in advanced digital infrastructure, prioritize human capital development and strengthen and upgrade its skills base to make a productive transition to a services-led growth model. Given the substantial ground to cover and the rising importance of services in a fast-digitalizing world, this push should not be delayed. At the same time, policymakers should focus on measures to prevent a precipitous decline in manufacturing, while helping industries adapt to the new manufacturing landscape. The policy response should not be limited to industrial interventions, which are temporary fixes at best and risk creating inefficiencies in the absence of sunset clauses. A more sustainable solution is to address the root causes of manufacturing weakness, many of which overlap with the requirements for a strong services sector such as human capital accumulation and infrastructure investment. Without this dual approach, countries would run the risk of unemployed factory workers drifting back to farms or moving to gig work or other low-skilled services jobs, thereby leading to productivity and wage stagnation. Brazil’s experience serves as a reminder that an overreliance on services could stall convergence in developing countries without a well-trained workforce. Though protectionism, China’s manufacturing dominance and rising capital-intensity of manufacturing have reduced opportunities to grow through export-oriented industrialization, they haven’t completely vanished for developing Asian economies. The ongoing diversification of supply chains away from China and the emergence of new green and tech industries offer these countries windows to experience rapid manufacturing-led growth, even as they prepare to transition to a services model. They should not squander this chance.",

    "description": "Nobuhiro Torii, Suntory's new president, is a member of the founding family.&nbsp;(Photo by Kosuke Imamura) Torii seeks to repeat his success with soft drinks in Vietnam and Thailand SEI MATSUMOTO and YUIYA SHIBATA March 26, 2025 04:40 JST TOKYO — Japanese beverage maker Suntory Holdings turns its focus on the Southeast Asian&nbsp;alcohol&nbsp;market under a new president,&nbsp;part of the company’s efforts to reach 4 trillion yen ($26.7 billion) in groupwide global sales by 2030. Nobuhiro Torii, a member of the founding family, became president at the regular shareholders meeting on Tuesday. Torii will oversee overall management, both domestically and overseas. Former President Takeshi Niinami, now a chairman with representative authority, also will be involved in the overseas business. In an interview with Nikkei before the shareholders&nbsp;meeting, Torii said he wants to “place the axis of future growth in Asia, excluding China and India.” “I would like to look at&nbsp;the growth potential of alcoholic beverages, particularly in Southeast Asia,” he said, signaling plans to&nbsp;develop that region into a pillar of growth following Japan and the U.S. The company will begin a full expansion of its alcohol business in Vietnam and Thailand, where its focus has been on the production and sale of soft drinks and tea beverages. Suntory posted 3.41 trillion yen in revenue for&nbsp;2024, up 4% from the previous year, with Japan and the Americas segments accounting for about 65% combined. Revenue in the Asia and Oceania category, including Thailand, Vietnam and Australia, accounted for around 20% at 617.39 billion yen. Most of this came from nonalcoholic beverages. Suntory’s new Australia plant will manufacture both soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. (Photo obtained by Nikkei) The alcoholic drinks market in the Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow 5% annually on average from 2024 to 2029, India’s Mordor Intelligence reports. Germany’s Roland Berger reported that alcohol consumption in the Asia-Pacific is expected to reach 102 billion liters in 2027, up 7% from 2024. “We need distilled spirits that are suited to the region, like shochu in Japan and baijiu in China,” Torii said. “Because it has a large population, if the market grows as it has for Japanese whisky and American bourbon, it could be a huge opportunity.” Torii plans to combine the expertise&nbsp;of Suntory Beverage &amp; Food, which already has a foothold in Southeast Asia with soft drinks, and Suntory Global Spirits — formerly Beam Suntory, born of Suntory’s acquisition of U.S. bourbon maker Jim Beam for 1.6 trillion yen in 2014 — which has a long history in the overseas alcoholic beverage business. The aim is to approach everything from sourcing raw materials to production and product development from the perspectives of both subsidiaries. A factory that opened in Australia last year embodies this strategy. Suntory Beverage &amp; Food invested 63 billion yen and began its first joint operation with Suntory Global Spirits, which produces chuhai canned cocktails and other drinks. The plant can produce both soft drinks and canned alcoholic drinks. Sales of canned alcoholic drinks produced there will begin in July. The facility also will serve as a storage and distribution base for whisky produced in Japan. By bringing the production of soft drinks handled by other plants under the same roof, Suntory boosts efficiency in terms of transportation and inventory management. “Once we can confirm demand and establish a supply system, we would like to expand the Australian model,” Torii said. The company hopes to produce both soft drinks and alcoholic beverages in Thailand and Vietnam. Torii is focused on Southeast Asia as he seeks to replicate his&nbsp;success in the beverage business in Thailand and Vietnam. He led Suntory Beverage &amp; Food as president from 2011 to 2016, going to Southeast Asia to help cultivate demand there. Despite facing challenges, such as the decision to withdraw from the unprofitable Indonesian soft drink business in 2024, Torii’s experience in Southeast Asia deepened his confidence as an executive. “Even in a market we failed in, we could still have a chance if we change the way we do things,” he said, suggesting a possible return to Indonesia with alcoholic beverages. Sales for Suntory Global Spirits&nbsp;have more than doubled in 10 years. Overseas sales now account for over 50% of the total for Suntory Holdings, as its foothold in the North American market has solidified. Torii aims for sales of 4 trillion yen in 2030 but said he will not set a target for an increase in the overseas sales ratio. He aims to achieve growth both in Japan and overseas, including domestic alcoholic beverages, where he also serves as the top executive.",

    "description": "Amkor Technology Japan expanded production capacity at its plant in&nbsp;Kumamoto prefecture, Japan, by 50% in 2022.&nbsp;(Amkor Technology Japan) Over 20 companies to team up on manufacturing and materials YOSHINARU SAKABE March 26, 2025 02:48 JST FUKUOKA, Japan — More than 20 Japanese companies involved in back-end semiconductor manufacturing will join forces on production and material supply to strengthen domestic supply chains. The alliance of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) providers will hold an inaugural meeting on April 21 in Tokyo and Fukuoka city. Amkor Technology Japan and Aoi Electronics are among the companies taking part. The 20-plus companies expected to become full-fledged members represent 80% of the back-end chipmaking industry in Japan. The group will also recruit companies involved in chip tools and materials. Makoto Sumita, former chairman of electronics component supplier TDK, will chair the alliance. Sumita currently serves as outside director of camera maker Nikon, among other companies. Starting in the latter half of fiscal 2025, the grouping will work on creating infrastructure geared toward mutually supplementary production, as well as on mechanisms for joint procurement of materials. A database that includes the operating status of each company’s production facilities and other information will be created. Members are expected to conduct joint research with equipment manufacturers on labor-saving techniques for production lines. The group plans to collaborate with regional organizations that train back-end chipmaking professionals. Semiconductors are packaged onto substrates during back-end processes. (Photo by Shotaro Mori) Semiconductor manufacturing is largely divided into front-end processes, where circuits are etched onto wafers, and back-end processes, which involve assembly, packaging and testing. Back-end production processes are often handles overseas, mainly in Asia. Taiwanese company ASE Technology Holding is one of the top two leading OSAT providers in terms of sales, along with Amkor Technology Japan’s U.S. parent, Amkor Technology. Although Amkor Technology Japan and Aoi Electronics are major players in Japan, the OSAT sector here is mostly populated by smaller companies that originated as subcontractors for major chip companies. The alliance aims to solidify the underlying business environment to ensure steady supplies of legacy products used in a wide range of applications, such as automobiles and industrial equipment. The group also looks to partner with universities to develop next-generation back-end production technology.",

    "description": "Ukraine's coast guard on patrol as&nbsp;a cargo ship passes by in the Black Sea in 2024. © Reuters Moscow wants Washington to 'order' Kyiv to follow deal March 26, 2025 01:55 JST WASHINGTON/MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) —&nbsp;The United States said on Tuesday it has reached separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea and to implement a ban on attacks by the two countries on each other’s energy facilities. The agreements, if implemented, would represent the clearest progress yet toward&nbsp;a wider ceasefire that Washington sees as a steppingstone toward&nbsp;peace talks to bring an end to Russia’s 3-year-old&nbsp;war in Ukraine. Russia, however, said it could not trust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&nbsp;and it could therefore only sign a Black Sea deal if Washington issued an “order” to him to respect it. “We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskyy and his team to do one thing and not the other,” Foreign Minister Sergey&nbsp;Lavrov said in televised comments. It was not immediately clear whether Moscow’s demand risked derailing the deal. Zelenskyy&nbsp;has previously said Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sent his army into Ukraine in February 2022, is not to be trusted over peace moves. Ukrainian Defense Minister&nbsp;Rustem Umerov said Kyiv had agreed to both a maritime ceasefire and a pause by Russia and Ukraine in attacks on each other’s energy infrastructure. But he said Kyiv would regard any movement of Russian military vessels outside the eastern part of the Black Sea as a violation and a threat. In this case Ukraine would have the full right to exercise self-defense, he said. Seeking to fulfill a pledge by President Donald Trump to end the war quickly, the U.S. originally proposed a full 30-day ceasefire — to which Ukraine agreed in principle on March 11 — as a step toward&nbsp;peace talks. But the Americans held separate talks in Saudi Arabia with Russia and Ukraine this week to discuss more limited ceasefires on energy and at sea, after Putin responded to the wider truce plan with a long list of conditions and questions. Trump is pressing both sides to bring a swift end to the war, something he promised to achieve when he ran for president last year. At the same time he is pursuing a rapid rapprochement with Moscow that both sides say could lead to lucrative business opportunities and cooperation across a wide range of areas, from minerals to sports and space exploration. Ukraine and its European allies fear Trump could strike a hasty deal with Putin that undermines their security and caves in to Russian demands, including for Kyiv to abandon its NATO ambitions and give up the entirety of four regions claimed by Russia as its own. Ukraine has rejected that as tantamount to surrender.",

    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on April 2, though the scope remains unclear. © Reuters U.S. to focus on trading partners with high barriers to avoid administrative overload RYOHEI YASOSHIMA March 26, 2025 01:17 JST WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s much-touted plan for reciprocal tariffs is likely to focus on a limited number of economies with nontariff barriers and large trade surpluses with the U.S., with Japan, the European Union, Canada and Mexico expected to be in the crosshairs. Trump had previously said that the levies to be announced April 2 would apply to all U.S. trading partners. But the president told reporters Monday that he “may give a lot of countries breaks.” Markets with which the U.S. has trade surpluses and does relatively little trade, such as African nations, could be spared. The reciprocal tariffs are expected to target markets that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has referred to as the “dirty 15” — a set of around 15% of trading partners that impose high tariffs and nontariff barriers, though the specific criteria remain unclear. A notice on a planned review of unfair trade practices by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative named the EU, China, Canada, Mexico, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, among others, as economies of particular interest. Those economies are likely to be on the “dirty 15” list. According to the U.S. Commerce Department, Japan had a trade surplus of $68.5 billion with the U.S. in 2024 while South Korea had $66 billion and India $45.7 billion, all&nbsp;far smaller than China’s $295.4 billion.&nbsp; Because these markets account for the bulk of U.S. trade in goods, even narrowing the reciprocal tariffs to just them would still raise the “large amounts of money” anticipated by Trump, the thinking goes. A more limited approach is being considered in part because the administrative burden of implementing reciprocal tariffs globally would be too great. The U.S. sets individual tariff rates on over 12,000 product categories, for each of the 166 members of the World Trade Organization, equating to roughly 2 million rates. With nontariff barriers also being taken into account for the reciprocal duties, it would be impossible to set new rates for every one of those, said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Singapore-based Hinrich Foundation. Top officials at the USTR, which is responsible for implementing the tariffs, have only been appointed in March. It does not have a system in place to handle a complete overhaul. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration at one point considered a simplified plan that would divide U.S. trading partners into three tariff tiers with one rate for each, though the idea was scrapped. Trump also said Monday that additional tariffs targeting autos and other items would be announced “over the next few days.” The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg had previously reported that duties on such specific sectors as autos and semiconductors might not be announced on April 2.",

    "description": "The Lexus luxury brand is central to&nbsp;Toyota's EV strategy. (Photo by Tomoko Wakasugi) Fukuoka factory is part of automaker's plans for electrifying Lexus cars TAKAYUKI YAO March 26, 2025 00:38 JST NAGOYA, Japan — Toyota Motor has postponed the construction a battery plant in southwestern Japan, as the world’s top automaker reassesses its strategy in the face of slowing global demand for electric vehicles. Toyota President Koji Sato on Tuesday traveled to Fukuoka prefecture, the site of the planned plant and met with Fukuoka Gov. Seitaro Hattori. Hattori said he expects to sign a location agreement by this fall — an event originally scheduled for April. It is unknown what impact the change will have on the planned start of operations in 2028, according to Hattori. While Toyota said it will eventually move forward with construction, it will reconsider the products that will be manufactured at the site, as well as the scale. The plant was scheduled to make batteries for next-generation Toyota EVs. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry plans to provide subsidies for the construction of the factory. Toyota’s Miyata assembly plant in Fukuoka prefecture has an annual production capacity of 430,000 vehicles, with 90% of the output bound for Asia and Europe. It assembles mainly Lexus cars. The luxury brand is at the core of Toyota’s EV strategy. A potential site for Toyota’s new battery plant in Japan’s Fukuoka prefecture. (Photo by Shotaro Mori) The new factory is supposed to make batteries with a range of 1,000 kilometers, which would significantly outperform current EVs. Global demand for electric cars has become harder to predict. GlobalData has downgraded its 2030 EV sales forecast by 540,000 vehicles to 32.18 million from 32.72 million. Although the EV market is slowing in the U.S., it is expanding in China. When it comes to cars, “the choice ultimately falls to the customer, and we’ll be prepared to respond to whatever comes along,” said Yoichi Miyazaki, Toyota’s chief financial officer. In 2023, Toyota announced plans to increase global EV sales to 1.5 million vehicles a year by 2026. But last year, Toyota notified parts suppliers to prepare for an output of 1 million vehicles in 2026. This year, the production goal was further reduced to 800,000. Toyota also faces the lingering threat of U.S. tariffs. The car company built its first North American battery plant in North Carolina, and shipments will start next month. Toyota will start by producing batteries for hybrid vehicles, which are enjoying robust sales. In China, Toyota is going on the offensive in EVs, even as other non-Chinese automakers scale down operations. Toyota is building a wholly owned Lexus EV plant in Shanghai that is scheduled to begin operations in 2027. Toyota this month released a roughly 110,000 yuan ($15,200) EV for the Chinese market, marking the lowest cost EV model launched by the company. Toyota’s strategy is to generate stable profits from hybrids. Its&nbsp;global sales of hybrids last year jumped 21% to 4.14 million units, giving it an estimated market share of about 60%. Meanwhile, Toyota’s EV sales in 2024 were only about 140,000 vehicles, or 1.4% of the global market. Hattori still has high hopes for the new battery factory in Fukuoka. “In the long term, it will contribute to job creation and growth as well as the development the local economy,” the governor said.",

    "description": "The new Japanese law aims to let app makers use stores other than those of Apple&nbsp;and Google, which charge fees considered high.&nbsp;(Photo by Masaharu Ban) American group says act hurts Apple and Google, as Trump reciprocal tariffs loom RIHO NAGAO March 26, 2025 00:22 JST TOKYO — A new Japanese law aimed at boosting competition in smartphone software has been criticized by a U.S. economic group for its potential harm to American companies, a claim that could bring attention from President Donald Trump and his aggressive trade tactics. The Act on Promotion of Competition for Specified Smartphone Software, which was enacted in 2024 and takes effect later this year, falls under the jurisdiction of the Japan Fair Trade Commission. It aims to prevent market monopolies in smartphone app distribution and payment, with tech giants like Apple and Google in mind. The law is intended to benefit consumers by increasing the number of app stores and payment providers other than Apple and Google. It is hoped that small and midsize Japanese app makers, which have been charged fees from Apple’s app store and others, will be able to use other services with lower fees. A Japanese app maker industry group issued a statement in support of the law last spring. On his first day in office, Trump called on the commerce secretary and other officials to investigate U.S. trade deficits and unfair trade practices by April 1. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) then called for opinions from industry groups and others by March 11. In response, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ), which has some sway over U.S. policies related to Japan, cited alleged barriers in Japan’s digital policy. Specifically, the group named the new smartphone software act, a digital trading transparency law, a law related to collecting consumption tax on digital platforms, and criteria for a cloud platform used by the national and local governments as problematic. The ACCJ argues that the smartphone act restricts the activities of U.S. companies, complaining that it excludes Yahoo Japan — the country’s most dominant web portal — and large Chinese companies, targeting only the two American players. Additionally, the group said the act raises costs for small and midsize U.S. app makers, increases security risks for consumers and weakens the intellectual property of American tech giants. The ACCJ seems concerned that the technological innovation and associated profits that U.S. companies have built up will be lost, to the benefit of Japanese and Chinese businesses. The USTR’s investigation will be the basis for the reciprocal tariffs that Trump is considering levying to create what the administration says is a level playing field. The Japan Fair Trade Commission is developing guidelines in preparation for the new smartphone law. “We are aware that U.S. industry groups have long been concerned about the impact on U.S. companies,” a source at the commission said. “The question is whether it will be included in the USTR report, but at this point there is no change in our preparations for implementation.” The USTR report is expected to be completed soon. The ACCJ also raised concerns about a Japanese digital trading transparency law, which targets U.S. companies like Meta and Amazon Japan, due to the burden of preparing documents for the law and that administration of the law is decided within a closed-door committee. “With statements by Trump and others dominating the conversation, the U.S. government’s administrative agencies are not functioning properly,” said Masahiko Hosokawa, a Meisei University professor and a trade expert. “It is unclear to what extent the issues raised in the public comment period will be reflected in the reciprocal tariffs.”",

Now Alysa Liu is back at this week’s world championships with a renewed purpose Alysa Liu looks back on the ice as rotates on her left foot, picking up speed before she completes her triple flip-triple toe combination. A group of high schoolers on a field trip sitting in the stands erupts into applause. She gives a smile and small bow as she skates away. It’s a recovery day for her, starting with dynamic stretching and cardio before moving onto the ice with her jumps, spins, and footwork. She drives herself to the rink for a two-hour skating session. Later this afternoon, she plans to attend her brother’s basketball game. If you had asked Liu a year and a half ago if she would be preparing for another figure skating world championships, she would have told you that you were crazy. Continue reading...",

In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL’s Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether. At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player.
