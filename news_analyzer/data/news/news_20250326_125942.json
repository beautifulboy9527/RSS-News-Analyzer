    "description": "萨姆·卡布拉尔（Sam Cabral） BBC新闻，华盛顿 15 分钟前 蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Walz） 蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Walz）起初是卡马拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）的潜在副手人选中名不见经传的一位。但随着他在电视节目上的一句“这些人就是怪”走红，他一跃成为民主党副总统候选人。 现年60岁的蒂姆·沃尔兹以接地气、坦率和犀利回应共和党反对派发起的进攻。 他还拥有一份引人注目的履历——在从政前，他曾担任过公立学校教师、美式橄榄球教练和国民警卫队队员。 他曾在国会代表一个倾向共和党的选区，后来又在明尼苏达州州长任上通过了左翼政策。在美国政治两极分化的今天，他的从政经历可能具有广泛的吸引力。 教师、教练和议员 沃尔兹出生于内布拉斯加州乡村，曾在夏天务农和打猎，17岁时加入美国陆军国民警卫队。他在这支志愿部队服役长达24年。 沃尔兹的父亲是一名公立学校行政人员，曾鼓励他参军。19岁时，他的父亲因肺癌去世。 这位明尼苏达州州长曾谈到他的母亲靠社会保障遗属津贴维生，而《美国军人权利法案》帮其支付了大学学费。 凭借教师学位，沃尔兹在1989年“六四”天安门镇压事件发生前后，赴中国担任了一年教师。 后来，他与妻子格温·惠普尔（Gwen Whipple）前往中国度蜜月，还组织美国学生暑期到中国游学。 回到内布拉斯加州家乡后，沃尔兹当上了老师和美式橄榄球教练，直到他的妻子（学校另一名教师）带他回到了明尼苏达州的家乡。他们现在育有两个孩子。 作为曼卡托西高中（Mankato West High School）的教练，沃尔兹帮助学校建立了美式橄榄球项目，并带领学校首次获得州冠军。 他还因同意担任学校同志与非同志联盟的指导老师而赢得赞誉，当时同性恋在很大程度上受到人们的排斥。 他最初在明尼苏达州南部一个以农业为主的地区竞选公职，这个地区非常乡村，倾向于共和党。 但沃尔兹因在竞选中表现得温和及关注公共服务和退伍军人权益而爆冷。 图像来源， Getty Images 2007 年众议院伊拉克投票后，蒂姆·沃尔兹和南希·佩洛西等一众的留影。 观点和信仰 在沃尔兹12年的国会生涯中，很难给他的意识形态贴上标签。 他投票支持《平价医疗法案》，共同发起了包括提高最低工资法案在内的有利于劳工的措施，并支持一项未获成功的减少碳排放的限额交易措施。 但他也找到了与共和党人的共同点。 他投票支持继续为伊拉克和阿富汗战争提供资金，支持对进入美国的难民进行更严格审查，并试图阻止奥巴马时代在2008年金融危机后对银行和汽车公司的救助。 支持拥枪权的全国步枪协会曾为他的竞选活动捐款。但在2018年佛罗里达帕克兰校园枪击案发生后，他公开表示支持禁止攻击性武器，因此失去了该协会的支持。 2018年，沃尔兹在明尼苏达州州长竞选中以超过11个百分点的优势胜出，但他的首个任期因新冠疫情和明尼阿波利斯警察杀害乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）事件而蒙上阴影。 共和党人严厉批评沃尔兹在抗议活动愈演愈烈时，仍迟迟没有部署国民警卫队。 但这名州长赢得了连任。在民主党以一个席位的优势控制着州议会的情况下，他的第二个任期相当忙碌。 该州民主党人将堕胎权奉为圭臬、制定了带薪事假和病假、加强了枪支法、为学校普及免费膳食提供资金，并对经济适用房进行投资。 这一系列紧锣密鼓的活动引起了前总统贝拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）的注意，他写道： “ 如果你需要一个实例证明选举是会产生影响的，看看明尼苏达州正在发生什么。” 图像来源， Getty Images 蒂姆·沃尔兹在从政之前是一名公立学校教师、橄榄球教练和国民警卫队成员。 “这些人都很怪” 沃尔兹在全国范围内知名度并不高，但最近几周，他对共和党人的尖刻描述迅速引起了热议。 “ 另一方都是怪人。 &quot;他最近在美国媒体MSNBC上说出这个频繁使用的标签。 “ 他们想要禁书。 他们想进入你（医生）的检查室。” 但共和党人很快就攻击他在明尼苏达州的所作所为，称其对普通美国人来说过于激进。 美国众议院排名第三的共和党人汤姆·埃默（Tom Emmer）指责沃尔兹试图 “ 把明尼苏达州变成卡马拉·哈里斯的家乡加利福尼亚州。” 但包括劳工领袖在内的盟友认为，沃尔兹可以扩大卡马拉·哈里斯对农村和工人阶级选民的吸引力。 众议院民主党人安吉·克雷格（Angie Craig）正在为连任展开激烈的竞争，她称赞沃尔兹是 “ 久经考验的领导者。” 她告诉BBC，沃尔兹是 “ 公认的赢家，在许多艰难的竞选中从未失败过”，她相信他将是卡马拉·哈里斯的最佳副手人选。",

    "description": "2024年7月29日 一场由变装艺术家演绎的宴会场景引来了基督教团体的批评，认为这一幕戏虐性地模仿了重要的圣经场景“最后的晚餐”。 巴黎奥运开幕至今，尺度较大的开幕式上若干细节成为遭到热议的话题，在各项赛事开始之后，赛场上也有争议现象出现。国际奥委会、巴黎奥组委甚至已对一些事件进行解释和道歉。 以下是BBC整理的本届奥运会截至目前的几大争议场面，以及其发酵讨论过程。 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 2024年巴黎奥运会有什么独特之处？ 奥组委为开幕式冒犯感“道歉” 一场由变装艺术家演绎的宴会场景引来了基督教团体的批评，认为这一幕戏虐性地模仿了文艺复兴时期著名画家达芬奇的名画“最后的晚餐”。 这幅名画描绘的是一个重要的圣经场景。 批评者之一法国天主教会（Catholic Church in France）表示，开幕式突出了“嘲弄、蔑视基督教的场景”。 图像来源， EPA 巴黎奥运开幕式上的表演包括演绎一场晚餐，以及模仿希腊神话酒神狄俄尼索斯，引发了批评。 美国电讯公司C Spire表示，在“被开幕式上对最后的晚餐进行的嘲弄震惊”后，正在撤下奥运会的周边广告。 意大利副总理萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）、美国众议院议长约翰逊（Mike Johnson）也提出批评，认为对《最后的晚餐》的嘲弄，令全球基督徒感到震惊及侮辱。 开幕式艺术总监若利（Thomas Jolly）表示，绝没有故意嘲弄或蔑视任何人，存在争议的场景是为了代表异教徒诸神。 “很明显，从来没有故意不尊重任何宗教群体的意图。”巴黎奥组委发言人德尚（Anne Descamps）周日（7月28日）对记者表示。 她说，“与之相反，我认为若利努力歌颂社区包容。我们相信这雄心壮志已经实现，若有任何人感到被冒犯，我们真的非常抱歉。” 若利也对法国媒体表示，“这个创意是为了展示一场和奥林匹斯众神有关的、盛大的多神的派对。” “在我的作品中你看不到嘲笑任何人的意图。我想要的是把人们团结在一起、调和各方的开幕式，同时展现自由、平等、博爱的法国大革命精神。” 错将韩国当朝鲜 国际奥委会道歉 图像来源， Reuters 在韩国代表团乘船参加开幕式时，法语及英语播报员介绍他们时都用的“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国”（Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea），毫无疑问这正是朝鲜（北韩）的官方名称。 这个名字稍后又被播报，不过这次用对了地方，介绍的是入场的朝鲜代表团。 南北朝鲜自从二战结束后分治，双方的紧张局势近日还有所升温。 不过，电视字幕上提供的名字是正确的。 韩国文化体育观光部随后表示，会就此过失向法国政府进行强烈抗议和投诉。该声明说，对于这一播报表示遗憾，因为韩国代表团被介绍为了朝鲜队。 该国文化体育观光部副部长张美兰（Jang Mi-ran）还要求就此事和国际奥委会主席巴赫进行会谈。 国际奥委会已经在其官方X（前推特）账号里称，“我们要就韩国代表团在开幕式上被错误介绍一事表示深深的道歉。” 前强奸犯参赛被嘘 图像来源， Getty Images 曾经犯下强奸儿童罪的荷兰沙滩排球运动员史蒂文·范德费尔德（Steven van de Velde）首次出现在奥运赛场，收获了掌声和嘘声。 2016年他因强奸一名12岁的英国女孩被判四年监禁。一年后获假释出狱，有犯罪纪录。 他和搭档目前世界排名第10，在埃菲尔铁塔体育场的首秀中败于一对意大利组合。他们将于31日出战下一场比赛。 范德费尔德在比赛前被介绍给观众时，赛场同时出现掌声和嘘声。 在首场比赛前，一份网络请愿呼吁禁止他参加奥运会，这份请愿书获得了9万签名。 有观众对BBC体育说出了自己的观点。 一位英国观众说，“他表现出了开放和诚实……但我个人觉得他们做出了一个艰难的决定。” 另一位英国观众说，“他们应该选择其他人，以避免引起争议。如果这是一个英国人，我可不愿让他出现在我们的队伍中。” 但一位荷兰观众说，范德费尔德参赛是对的，“他已经受到了惩罚，都结束了。他可以像其他人一样继续生活。” 范德费尔德此前接受荷兰媒体采访时说，“我无法改变（观众），因此我必须承受后果。这是我人生中的最大错误。” 国际奥委会表示，运动员的选择权在国家奥委会。 范德费尔德2017年重回赛场，荷兰奥委会说，他已经满足了荷兰排球联合会关于运动员犯罪后重返赛场的标准。",

    "description": "24 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 巴黎奥运会的金银铜牌 在巴黎奥运会的拳击和田径两个项目中，夺冠的运动员获得的不仅仅是奖牌。 1896年，现代奥运会在雅典拉开帷幕，当时这是一项严格意义上的业余赛事，既没有职业运动员，也不允许提供奖金。 然而，在今年夏天的巴黎，运动员中既有年收入数亿美元的超级富豪，也有艰难负担比赛费用的参赛者。 奥运选手的收入来源多种多样：赞助商、国家给予的经济奖励，以及本届首次在奥运会上发放的奖金。 由于并非每个项目都有奖金，这一决定引发了争议，即如何最好地分配奥运会带来的财富。 2024巴黎奥运奖牌榜 张家朗、江旻憓巴黎奥运夺金 拆解香港如何成为剑击之城 仅限拳击和田径 图像来源， Getty Images 朱利安·阿尔弗雷德 (Julien Alfred) 在赢得女子 100米冠军后将获得 50,000 美元奖金以及金牌。 朱利安·阿尔弗雷德（​Julien Alfred）在夺得女子100米冠军后，将获得5万美元奖金和金牌。 在2024年巴黎奥运会的32个体育项目中，只有田径和拳击两个项目可以获得奖金。 今年4月，国际田径管理机构世界田联（World Athletics）出人意料地宣布，2024年巴黎奥运会金牌得主将获得5万美元（3.94万英镑）的奖金。 一个月后，国际拳击协会（IBA）表示，该机构也将向奥运冠军发放10万美元（7.87万英镑）的奖金，不过其中四分之一将归运动员所在国的拳击协会所有，另外四分之一归教练所有。 在这两项运动中，银牌和铜牌获得者的奖金较少。而拳击比赛中，排名前五的选手都将获得奖励。 这些奖金并非直接来自奥运会主办方，而是来自这两个项目的管理机构。 世界田联正在使用从国际奥委会（IOC）获得的部分资金，这些资金是奥运会收入的一部分。而这笔钱以前被用于更广泛的运动员培养，有人质疑设立奖金是否是明智之举。 考文垂大学（Coventry University）社会商业中心的汤姆·巴森（Tom Bason）博士专门研究大型体育赛事。他说：“奖金流向获胜者，这或许强化了顶级运动员是有偿（竞技）的事实。” “在田径项目上夺金的人，很可能已经是那些拥有巨额赞助和代言合同的人了。” “其中一种批评声是，这笔钱可以更好地用于培养运动员，把钱花在年轻运动员身上，而不是那些在比赛中名列前茅的人。” 不过，考虑到一些奥运冠军曾陷入经济困境，他们亦能从额外的收入中受益。苏联体操传奇人物奥尔加·科尔布特（Olga Korbut）在其奥运生涯中获得了四枚金牌和两枚银牌。但在2017年，她不得不以33.35万美元的价格出售了自己的三枚奖牌。 拳击比赛奖金的来源则不太清楚。国际奥委会最近断绝了与国际拳击协会的一切联系，理由是后者的运作“缺乏财务透明度。” “与以往国际拳击协会的资金一样，这笔钱的来源尚不清楚。”国际奥委会在一份公开声明中说。 巴森博士补充说：“也许有人会说，国际拳击协会这样做是为了让自己成为奥运会的一部分，并与其保持密切联系。” 民族自豪感 图像来源， Getty Images 运动员在奥运会上获得奖牌后，还有很多其他方式可以获得经济奖励。 许多运动员会因为能登上领奖台，而获得所在国家的奖励。 新加坡被认为是在支付奖金方面最慷慨的地方之一，每位巴黎的金牌得主将获得75万美元的奖金。 东道主法国的奖金为8万欧元（8.7万美元），而摩洛哥运动员的奖金更高，为20万美元。 美国则更少，该国的“黄金行动”（Operation Gold）基金向运动员发放3.75万美元。 英国等国则完全不向奖牌得主提供经济奖励。 取而代之的是，英国国家队在奥运会前会向运动员提供一定数额的资助。被认定有很大机会夺金的选手每年最多可获得2.8万英镑。 虽然这些钱绝非小数目，但与世界上最著名的运动员所能赚取的巨额财富相比，还是相差甚远。 “（参加奥运会的）运动员中，既有像美国篮球队那样拿着高薪的球员，也有靠兼职工作养活自己的运动员。”巴森博士说。 明星的力量 图像来源， Getty Images NBA 巨星NBA 巨星勒布朗·詹姆斯是奥运会上收入最高的运动员之一。 根据《福布斯》发布的年度体育富豪榜，西班牙高尔夫名将乔恩·拉姆（Jon Rahm）是2024年巴黎奥运会收入最高的运动员。据这本财经杂志估计，拉姆去年的收入为2.18亿美元，其中大部分收入来自备受争议的由沙特资助的LIV高尔夫巡回赛。 意料之中的是，收入排名第二的是美国明星篮球运动员勒布朗·詹姆斯（Lebron James）。据信，他的收入为1.28亿美元。 由于高尔夫和篮球在国际上的影响力巨大，参加奥运会可能对拉姆和詹姆斯本已丰厚的收入影响不大。 但对于知名度较低的运动员来说，赢得奖牌可以帮助他们增加收入，这是他们所急需的。 他们通常会在代言合同中写入一项条款，规定如果他们登上领奖台，就可从赞助商那里获得奖金。 这些条款一般都是保密的，但2016年耐克（Nike）和新百伦（New Balance）的一场法律纠纷披露，如果美国长跑选手鲍里斯·贝里安（Boris Berian）在奥运会上夺金，将获得15万美元的奖金。 “我想很多人看到美国顶级运动员或为欧洲球队效力的国际足球运动员，就认为每名运动员都可以动辄每周挣10万、20万美元，但事实远非如此。”巴森博士说。 “有许多运动员都在为生计而挣扎。几年前，澳大利亚曾做过一项研究，他们发现目前在为2032年奥运会进行训练的运动员中，有40%的人都有一份兼职或全职工作。” 即使是在拥有许多世界上最富有的体育明星的美国，许多选手的生活也依然不易。​ 美国奥委会和残奥委会最近的一项研究发现，26.5%的现役运动员年收入低于1.5万美元。 跳过 YouTube 帖子, 1 允许Google YouTube内容 此文包含Google YouTube提供的内容。由于这些内容会使用曲奇或小甜饼等科技，我们在加载任何内容前会寻求您的认可。 您可能在给与许可前愿意阅读Google YouTube 小甜饼政策 和 隐私政策 。 希望阅读上述内容，请点击“接受并继续”。 Accept and continue 告知：第三方内容可能包含广告 结尾 YouTube 帖子, 1 无内容 继续浏览 YouTube BBC对外部网站内容不负责任。 未来的变化 2024年巴黎奥运会颁发的每枚奖牌上，都有一小块取自埃菲尔铁塔的铁片。 向顶级运动员发放奖金是否是体育协会资金的最佳用途，这一激烈的辩论将继续，很可能会扩大到田径和拳击以外的领域。 “（各运动的）体育协会肯定会面临支付奖金的压力。”巴森博士说。 不过，这可能会给媒体曝光率较低的体育项目带来问题，从而导致资金短缺。 “田径和国际拳击是世界上最受瞩目的两项运动。&quot;巴森博士说。“这两项运动将更容易从赞助和代言中获得额外资金。” “而其他运动项目，比如皮划艇，如果它有支付运动员奖金的压力，可能就不那么容易了。” 2024年巴黎奥运会的冠军们至少可以安慰自己，他们将至少获得一枚金牌。 那金牌价值几何？ 今年的奥运金牌含有505克银和6克金——自1912年以来金牌就不是纯金的——其原始价值为950美元。 但巴黎的奥运冠军们希望，他们的夺金记忆是无价的。",

    "description": "22 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 周一日本股市盘中跌幅已经超过了1987年的“黑色星期一”。 日本股市坐上“过山车”——周一（8月5日）暴跌，经历“黑色星期一”，周二则大幅反弹。 本周一，日经225指数跌12.4%，收报31506点，已抹去今年以来所有涨幅。其盘中跌幅已经超过了1987年的“黑色星期一”，收盘跌幅12.4%则是日本股市历史上第二大跌幅。 不仅日本，亚洲股市普遍暴跌，韩国综合指数盘中跌幅一度扩大至10%，为2008年以来最大跌幅，收跌8.77%；台湾股市方面，台湾证交所加权股价指数收跌8.35%，为历史最大单日跌幅，其中台积电领跌大盘，股价跳水9.8%。此外，印度、澳洲、新加坡股指都在不同程度大跌。 到美国开盘时间，股市重挫，尤其是科技股。纳斯达克指数崩跌超过1000点，达6.34％；标普500跌3.65％。 这一轮大跌中，中国A股和香港股市躲过一劫，仅小幅下跌。 周二，日本股市又大幅反弹。开盘后一度涨幅超过10%，收复前一天大部分跌幅。韩国开盘上涨4%，台湾上涨3%。 三点原因导致暴跌 周一暴跌的原因何在？ 穆迪分析（Moody’s Analytics）列出了三点原因： 暴跌很大程度上反映了人们对美国可能走向衰退的担忧； 尽管经济数据不佳且通胀放缓，但日本央行上周三却意外上调了短期政策利率，并表示未来还将上调更多利率，日元因此飙升，而此举削弱了日本制造业的出口竞争力，因此日本股市受到打击尤为严重； 与人工智能相关的科技股也受到冲击，影响了台湾和韩国的股票估值，这些地区的芯片制造商生产了全球大部分用于人工智能应用的高端半导体。 换言之，恐慌情绪的源头来源于美国最近经济数据带来的担忧；日本因为恰好上调利率，导致日元飙升，连锁反应下，受伤尤为严重；而韩国、台湾受到连累，科技股受伤较重，而上述两国股市科技股成分较高，与美日市场关联也大。 上周五，美国公布就业数据，7 月份美国经济新增就业岗位 11.4 万个，低于投资者预期的 17.5 万个。失业率升到三年来最高水平，加重了市场对美国经济衰退的担忧，再加上中东动荡加剧，使市场抛售情绪在周一开盘时爆发。 受伤最终的日本股市更为独特。过去一年半，美联储维持高利率，日本央行则没有跟着升息，而是按兵不动。 因此，日元对美元不断贬值，投资者借机进行大量的套息交易。即投资者以日元进行廉价借贷，以美元或欧元进行高收益投资，同时拿到利息差和投资收益，这种交易蓬勃发展，使日币进一步走低。 对于日本公司而言，也乐于见到这种情况，因为日本企业有大量投资在海外，赚取美元，在日本的财报则用日元结算，使其收益增加，国际投资者在过去一年涌入日本股市，推高市场。 图像来源， Getty Image 美国纽交所交易员 但是，上周日本央行意外加息，将政策利率上调了15个基点。此举让投资者担忧；随着日本加息，日元可能升值，那么规模巨大的套息交易可能难以为继。 本周一，在美国经济预期的低迷情绪下，叠加日本加息的影响，全球投资者开始进行“套利交易逆转”（unwind）的操作，即卖出美元、港币等高利率资产，买回日元。而此前因为利差导致对日企收益的乐观情绪也不复存在，抛售就此展开。 美国经济真的要衰退了吗？ 有这种担忧，来自上周五公布的美国就业数据，7月份创造了11.4万个就业岗位，远低于预期的17.5万个，失业率也升至 4.3%，创下近三年来的新高，这触发了一个被称为“萨姆法则”（Sahm rule）的经济学法则。 该法则以美国经济学家克劳迪娅·萨姆（Claudia Sahm）的名字命名，它指出，如果三个月的平均失业率比过去12个月的最低水平高出半个百分点，那么这个国家就处于经济衰退的初期。 由此测算，美国7月份的失业率有所上升，因此三个月的平均失业率为4.1%。而去年的最低水平为 3.5%，高出0.6%，符合“萨姆法则”中衰退初期的条件。 更令人担忧的是，美国联邦储备委员会上周投票决定不降息。而其他发达经济体的中央银行，包括英格兰银行和欧洲中央银行，最近都降低了利率。 美联储维持利率不变，但其主席鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）称，9 月份降息是可以考虑的。这一表态引起了市场担忧——美联储采取行动的等待期是否太长了。 降息意味着借贷的成本更低，这在理论上应该会对经济起到促进作用。但如果就业数据表明经济已经开始下滑，那么人们就会担心美联储即便降息也为时已晚。 除此之外，还有科技公司及其股价。科技公司的股价长期上涨，部分原因是对人工智能（AI）的乐观情绪。上周，芯片制造巨头英特尔宣布裁员15，000人。与此同时，市场传言称竞争对手英伟达（Nvidia）可能不得不推迟发布新的人工智能芯片。 随之而来的是科技重镇美国纳斯达克指数（Nasdaq）的血洗。纳斯达克指数在几周前创下高点后，周五暴跌 10%。 这助长了整个市场的恐惧因素，而这正是危险所在。如果股市恐慌持续，股价继续暴跌，美联储有可能在9月份的下次会议之前介入，并降低利率。 图像来源， Getty Image 美国马里兰州一个地产项目 凯投宏观（Capital Economics）首席经济学家尼尔·希林（Neil Shearing）认为，“如果市场失调加深并开始威胁到具有系统重要性的机构和/或更广泛的金融稳定”，这种情况就可能发生。 但也有些好消息。“萨姆法则”的提出者本人在周一告诉美国媒体，“我们现在并没有陷入衰退。” 她补充说，“经济衰退并非不可避免，还有很大的降息空间。” 其他人则对就业数据持模棱两可的态度。 “虽然报告很糟糕，但并没有那么糟糕。”希林认为，最近席卷美国的飓风贝里尔可能是造成 7 月份薪资数据疲软的原因之一。其他数据显示劳动力市场正在降温，但并未崩溃。 希林补充说：“解雇人数似乎没有增加。” 而 7 月份平均每周工作时间的小幅下降并不意味着经济衰退， 他说。",

    "description": "33 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 中国官方一封文件称，要实施“网证”，这可能意味着中国网民可能未来要持证上网；此文件一出，即便在信息管理严格的中文互联网上，也引起巨大的反响，包括清华大学教授在内的学者也质疑此举监管过度。 不过，学者和大量网民的反对意见很快在中文社交媒体微博上遭删除。 该文件名为《国家网络身份认证公共服务管理办法（征求意见稿）》，由中国公安部，以及中国政府实施网络监管的主要机构“国家网信办”两部门共同起草。 值得注意的是，虽然该征求意见稿明确，意见建议反馈截止日期为8月25日，但“国家网络身份认证试点版”App已在中国多个手机应用商店上线，用户已可以通过身份核验，获得一张带有“网号”的电子网络身份凭证。同时该App试点应用已涵盖10个政务APP和71个互联网APP，包括淘宝、微信和小红书。 征求意见稿解释，网号，是指与自然人身份信息一一对应，由字母和数字组成、不含身份信息的网络身份符号；网证，是指承载网号及自然人非明文身份信息的网络身份认证凭证。网号、网证可用于在互联网服务及有关部门、行业管理、服务中非明文登记、核验自然人真实身份信息。 征求意见稿说明称，基于国家网络身份认证公共服务，自然人在互联网服务中依法需要登记、核验真实身份信息时，可通过国家网络身份认证APP自愿申领并使用“网号”和“网证”进行非明文登记、核验，无需向互联网平台等提供明文个人身份信息。“由此，可以最大限度减少互联网平台以落实‘实名制’为由超范围采集、留存公民个人信息。” 简而言之，该文件称，通过该系统，用户只需通过政府推出的App进行身份核验，而不需要把关键的个人信息交给淘宝等互联网平台，从而可以减少互联网各平台超范围采集和留存公民的个人信息。 图像来源， PA 反对意见：越权之嫌 对于征求意见期还未过，就已经开始试行。有微博网友称，征询意见的期限还没到就急吼吼地实行了，那还征询什么意见，与政府自己制定的《行政管理法》的法律法规都相冲突。 对于此征求意见稿持反对意见者众多，其中最受关注的是清华大学法学教授劳东燕。她发帖分析称，指出了其中三个问题：缺乏“上位法”，架空“自愿原则”，越权之嫌。 劳东燕称，《办法》的核心意思是准备推行网号与网证制度，但这样的举措不仅蕴含极大的社会风险，而且完全缺乏上位法的依据。《办法》虽提到自愿原则，却未对自愿原则的实现提供基本保障，考虑到自愿原则在中国语境下易于被架空的现实，该原则同样难以为网证制度提供正当依据。她说，保护个人信息只是一种幌子，目的是让社会控制变得常规化和规范化。 “我认为，以部门规章的形式推出网证制度缺乏正当性，明显存在越权之嫌，有必要提交全国人大宪法与法律委员会对《办法》进行合宪性审查。”劳东燕称。 对于上述“自愿原则”被架空的可能，北京大学法学院教授沈岿也提出担忧称，通常在鼓励推广之下，统一“网号”“网证”的使用会越来越普遍、越来越广泛。甚至，不排除实行实名制的网络平台将来直接要求用户使用“网号”“网证”登记，而不给用户选择的机会。 一篇流传颇广但已被删除的评论文章《我担心哪天我的上网证被吊销了》称，“网证”变成了一种白名单制度，即凭证才能上网，被许可后才能上网；它的危险性在于，任何人被处罚或者监管后，可能会吊销“网证”，那么是否就剥夺了个人的上网权利，而且以疫情管控为例，中国监管往往层层加码，那么这种级别的监管，终将“祸国殃民”。 图像来源， Getty Images 官方辩解：减少信息泄露 征求意见稿中有三点设置，似乎为了减少可能的争议：自愿原则、“最小化和必要性原则”、减少信息泄露。 征求意见稿提出，鼓励互联网平台按照自愿原则接入公共服务，用以支持用户使用网号、网证登记、核验用户真实身份信息，依法履行个人信息保护和核验用户真实身份信息的义务。 “最小化和必要性原则”，即公共服务平台处理个人信息不得超出为自然人提供“网号”“网证”相关服务所必需的范围和限度。 减少信息泄露。对于用网号网证通过验证的用户，互联网平台不得要求用户另行提供明文身份信息，法律、行政法规另有规定或者用户同意提供的除外。 中国政法大学副教授朱巍对中国官媒称，国家推出了统一认证的机构、统一的信息存储平台，俗称eID的“网号”“网证”制度，也可以理解成每个人在互联网上也有身份证。在统一的“网证”制度下，单个平台无法获取用户个人信息，能大幅减少信息泄露的风险。在统一的身份认证制度下，对于电信诈骗者可以全网封禁其网证，杜绝其更换平台、手机号复活的机会，有利于打击电信诈骗。 另有自媒体发文辩解称，“为社会公众统一签发‘网号’和‘网证’，实际上不是为了管理公众，而是为了治理平台。以我们现在的网络建设水平，个人的上网痕迹信息，哪怕你是匿名的，其实也被记录、可追踪，网号、网证制度不会强化既有能力。我国实行电话卡实名制已经有十一年了，我们用任何软件都需要手机号注册才能发布内容和评论，发布什么违法言论是会被查到的。我们的个人信息早已被掌握，但只要你遵纪守法，谁会去查你呢？”",

    "title": "BBC专访朝鲜“脱北”外交官李日奎: 金正恩希望特朗普当选美国总统",

    "description": "珍妮·麦肯锡（Jean Mackenzie） BBC驻首尔记者 5 分钟前 图像来源， BBC / Hosu Lee 李日奎曾经是朝鲜驻古巴大使馆参赞，于去年11月带着妻儿投奔韩国，成为自2016年以来逃往韩国的最高级别外交官。 投奔韩国的前朝鲜外交官李日奎（Ri Il Kyu 音译）认为， 平壤希望特朗普（Donald Trump 川普）当选美国总统。 因为若他重新入主白宫，那将是朝鲜（北韩）“千载难逢的机会”。 这位有着独特地位并了解平壤的外交官曾经是朝鲜驻古巴大使馆参赞。它于去年11月带着妻儿投奔韩国，成为该国自2016年以来逃往韩国的最高级别外交官，最近接受了BBC的访问。 今年52岁的李日奎曾经七次面对面与金正恩会面。当他去年与家人从古巴逃亡到首尔时，李日奎接受采访。他当时坦承，自己在平壤第一次见到金正恩时“浑身发抖，紧张不安。” 但之后的每次会面中他发现金正恩总是“微笑，心情愉悦”。 “他常常称赞别人，还会大笑，看起来像是一个普通人！”李日奎告诉BBC。 不过，李日奎又强调称他毫无疑问地认为金正恩会不惜一切代价确保自己的生存，即使这意味着要他杀了2500万朝鲜人民：“他本可以成为一个好人和好爸爸。但将他塑造成神话却使他成为了一个怪物。” 在他首次接受国际广播媒体的采访中，李日奎罕有分享他的观察，以助人们了解到这个世界上最神秘和最专制的国家想要实现的目标。李日奎强调，尽管2019年金正恩与特朗普的会谈破裂，但朝鲜仍然视这位前美国总统为可以就核武器计划与平壤谈判的人物。 朝鲜外交官为何叛逃？经济困难可能是重要原因 普京访朝：中国才是普京与金正恩背后的真正力量 闯入传说中“不存在”的朝鲜地标 历史性会面：特朗普“三八线”握手金正恩 过去，特朗普曾称赞与金正恩的关系是其任期内的一项重要成就，并还曾出了名地表示他们“敬爱对方”并互相写信。就在上个月的一场集会上，特朗普对支持者称，金正恩“想念”他,并希望他重新入主白宫。 据此，李日奎表示平壤希望利用这一亲密的个人关系来谋取利益，虽然这与平壤上月发表的一份官方声明相矛盾。该声明称朝鲜“不在乎谁当选美国总统。” 他又对BBC特别提到，称这个拥核国家永不会放弃核武，并可能寻求达成一项协议以冻结其核计划作为换取美国解除制裁之条件。但他补充称平壤不会真诚地进行谈判，而平壤同意冻结其核计划“是一个诡计，百分之百的欺骗”，与平壤在核武谈判是一种“危险的做法”,只会“协助朝鲜更强”。 图像来源， Handout 2019年特朗普跨越三八线的历史性时刻 “生死赌注” 在叛逃8个月后，李日奎现在与家人一起生活在韩国。在韩国警察保镖和两名情报人员的陪同下，他解释了自己决定背弃平壤之原因。 他表示，在朝鲜多年的生活要面对腐败、贿赂和缺乏自由。最后的导火线是他的颈椎滑脱需要动手术，但申请后被拒绝了。“我在朝鲜享有顶层阶级1%的生活，但那仍比韩国中产阶级家庭的生活还要糟糕。” 作为朝鲜在古巴的外交官，李日奎说他每月只赚500美元，因此他非法在中国贩售古巴雪茄来维持家计。当他最初告诉妻子想要逃亡的念头时，妻子吓得心脏出现问题，进了医院。之后他只在飞机起飞前6小时告诉妻子和孩子他的逃亡计划。他形容这是一次“生死赌注”。 在朝鲜，被抓的脱北者，如果是平民通常会被审问数月后获释。但对于像他这样的精英人士来说只有两种结局：被关进政治犯集中营或枪决。“担忧和恐惧让人无法承受。我可以接受自己的死，但我无法承受家人被拖进劳改营的想法！”他说。 李日奎称，尽管他从未相信上帝，但在机场门口焦急等待时他还是开始祈祷。 2016年以来，平壤最有名的高级别叛逃者是太永浩（Tae Yong-ho），他曾是朝鲜助英国副大使，最近被任命为韩国总统顾问委员会下“统一事务委员会”的新任主席。 谈到朝鲜最近与俄罗斯的更紧密关系，李日奎又说，乌克兰战争对平壤而言是一种幸运。美国和首尔估计平壤已向莫斯科出售数百万发弹药以支援其入侵行动。作为交换，朝鲜获得了食品、燃料，甚至可能还有军事技术。他强调，这笔交易对平壤最主要的好处是能够继续发展其核武器。他还解释说，俄罗斯通过这笔交易制造了一个“漏洞”（loophole）使得金正恩能够“自由发展其核武器和导弹，加强其军事防御的同时无需向美国请求缓解制裁”。 图像来源， EPA 李日奎说乌克兰战争对平壤而言是一种幸运。美国和首尔估计平壤已向莫斯科出售数百万发弹药以支援其入侵行动。作为交换，朝鲜获得了食品、燃料甚至可能还有军事技术。 但他表示，事实上金正恩明白与莫斯科的这种关系是暂时的。乌克兰战争结束后，俄罗斯很可能会断绝这种关系。因此，金正恩并未放弃与美国正常化关系的计划。 “朝鲜明白其生存的唯一道路，亦即消除遭受入侵的威胁、发展经济的唯一方式就是与美国关系正常化。” 虽然俄罗斯可能协助朝鲜暂时缓解了经济痛苦。但李日奎表示，在新冠大流行期间完全封闭国境“严重破坏了该国的经济和人民生活。”当2023年边境重新开放，朝鲜外交官准备回国时，李先生称，家人们要求他们“带回任何和所有你拥有的东西，甚至是你的旧牙刷！因为朝鲜一无所有了。” 金正恩要求其公民绝对忠诚，哪怕是一丝丝反对的气息也可能导致入狱。 但他强调，多年的痛苦生活已经侵蚀了朝鲜人的忠诚。因为，现在没有人再指望从最高领导人金正恩那里得到任何东西：“对政权或金正恩的忠诚不再是真的。那是被迫的忠诚，因为要不是忠诚，就是面临死亡。” “最邪恶的行为” 朝鲜最近的变化，主要是由于大量走私进入朝鲜的韩国电影、电视剧和音乐。这在朝鲜是非法的。据此，李日奎表示“朝鲜人观看韩国文化内容不是因为有资本主义信仰，而只是试图在单调而灰暗的生活中打发时间。但随后人们会问：“为什么南方人过着第一世界国家的生活，而我们却生活在贫苦之中?” 你的器材不支持播放多媒体材料 脱北者讲述他们在朝鲜的生活 不过，李先生说，南韩文化产品正在改变朝鲜，但由于现有的控制系统，这些产品不可能导致朝鲜政权崩溃。“金正恩非常清楚，人民忠诚度正在下降，人们正在改变，这就是为什么他加强了恐怖统治的力度。” 平壤颁布了更严酷的法律用以惩罚那些消费和传播韩国文化商品的人。BBC去年采访了一名脱北者，他表示目睹有人因分享韩国音乐和电视节目而被处死。李日奎说，朝鲜去年年底放弃了数十年的最终与韩国统一的政策，这是进一步将朝鲜人民与韩国隔离的一次尝试。 李日奎将此描述为金正恩的“最邪恶的行为。”因为，所有朝鲜人都梦想着统一。他又向BBC解释说，,尽管过去的朝鲜领导人“偷走了人们的自由、金钱和人权”但金正恩却抢走了他们所剩不多的东西：希望。 在朝鲜之外，人们高度关注金正恩的健康状况。有人认为他可能过早去世，而这也许会导致政权的崩溃。 上一周，韩国情报机构估计金正恩的体重达140公斤，并面临心血管疾病的风险。但李日奎认为，朝鲜的监视和控制的系统已经建立得很牢固，以至于金正恩即便去世也不会危及这个专制政权。“会有另一个邪恶的领导者取代他的位置。” 还有人普遍猜测金正恩正在培养他年轻的女儿（据称名为金珠爱）作为他的继承人。但李先生驳斥了这种说法。他说，金氏家族用来证明其统治正当性是来自“神圣的白头山血统”，而且这被认为只能通过家族中的男性传承。因此，金珠爱缺乏成为朝鲜领导人的合法性和人气。他又说，起初人们对金珠爱很感兴趣，但现在已不再如此了。人民质疑她为什么要参加导弹试验而不是上学，为什么要穿奢侈的品牌服装而不是像其他孩子一样穿学校制服。 图像来源， Reuters 2019年特朗普与朝鲜领导人金正恩的历史性握手 李日奎认为，国际社会不应等待金正恩生病或死亡，而是要团结起来。包括朝鲜的盟友中国和俄罗斯“持续劝说平壤改变。” 他补充说这是唯一能结束朝鲜专制的方法。 最后，他说，希望他的叛逃能激励同伴，不是要他们也脱北，而是要他们从内部推动小的改变。他说，他并没有什么大的期望，比如朝鲜人能够投票或自由旅行。他只是希望人民能选择自己的工作，有足够的食物吃并能在朋友间自由地表达自己的言论。 不过，目前李日奎的优先事项是帮助家人适应在韩国的新生活，让孩子融入社会。 在采访结束时，他向我提出了一个假设情境说：“假如我提供你一个机会，如果成功我们会大赚一笔但失败就得死。你不会同意加入这个计划吧？这就是我强加在我妻儿身上的选择，而他们默默地同意并跟随我。” “这是一笔我必须终生偿还的债。” BBC韩语组权赫（Jake Kwon）和李浩水（Hosu Lee ）共同参与了此报导。",

    "description": "阿格尼娅（Aghnia Adzkia）, 武珍（Tran Vo） BBC国际部 56 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 自去年中柬“金龙”联合军演以来，柬埔寨的云壤海军基地迅速发展，并且有两艘疑似中国“江岛级”护卫舰的船只在此驻扎七个月，这引发了对该地区稳定的担忧。 根据BBC在军事专家的帮助下对BlackSky公司的实时卫星图像的分析，几乎整个190英亩的区域现在都被建筑物、道路和码头占据，仅有约8%的区域被树木或草地覆盖，而两年前这里绿色区域占了一半。 时任中国驻柬埔寨大使王文天在2022年6月举行的开工仪式上确认。中国“援助”了云壤海军基地升级改造项目。 中国官宣柬埔寨云壤海军基地“升级改造” 时间线与战略意义 两名军事专家对BBC称，卫星图片上两艘停靠在这里的护卫舰看起来像是中国护卫舰。 “它们是‘江岛级’护卫舰，长90米，最大宽度11、14米，”一位要求匿名的军事情报分析师对BBC表示。 自2023年12月至2024年6月，这两艘船只一直在此停泊，比战略与国际研究中心（CSIS）早些时候记录的5个月时间更长。 战略与国际研究中心东南亚项目主任格雷戈里·B·波林（Gregory B Poling）表示，云壤基地将裨益中方。 “云壤基地的雷达跟踪系统可以帮助中国人民解放军在马六甲海峡和印太地区的行动，”波林在接受BBC采访时说。 在冲突情况下，该基地可以支持燃料补给、弹药和部署。 专家表示，如果中国护卫舰在基地的隐秘访问和隐藏任务继续下去，可能会引发“灾难性失败”。 位于柬埔寨西南的云壤海军基地距离新加坡只有1000公里。该基地位于重要战略位置，它靠近泰国湾的入口以及柬埔寨政府计划建设的该国最大运河的深水港西哈努克市。该基地还靠近马六甲海峡——国际航运路线的咽喉要道。 图像来源， Getty Images 地理位置示意图 基地的迅速扩建 柬埔寨雲壤海軍基地2022年以來的變化 2022年6月18日 來源：BlackSky @-moz-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-moz-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-moz-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-webkit-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-ms-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-ms-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-ms-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes gel-spin{0%{transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.bbc-news-visual-journalism-loading-spinner{display:block;margin:8px auto;width:32px;height:32px;max-width:32px;fill:#323232;-webkit-animation-name:gel-spin;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-webkit-animation-timing-function:linear;-moz-animation-name:gel-spin;-moz-animation-duration:1s;-moz-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-moz-animation-timing-function:linear;animation-name:gel-spin;animation-duration:1s;animation-iteration-count:infinite;animation-timing-function:linear} ﻿.bbc-news-vj-wrapper{font-family:\"Heiti SC\", \"黑体\", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif} 根据BlackSky给BBC提供的卫星图像分析，从2022年6月到2024年6月，两年内这里已经建成了14座大型建筑、一座码头和一片填海区域。 随着建设速度的加快，专家们认为中国帮助了柬埔寨政府。 “如果没有中国在资金、物流和建筑专业知识方面的大力援助，柬埔寨政府不可能建成这些设施，”朱拉隆功大学政治学与国际关系教授提提南·蓬苏迪拉克（Thitinan Pongsudhirak）对BBC表示。 “云壤使柬埔寨更加靠近中国主导东南亚大陆的轨道。因此，云壤将使柬埔寨在东盟成员国中坚定地成为中国的座上宾。” 他还认为，云壤基地似乎“违反了柬埔寨宪法中关于禁止建立外国军事基地的规定”。 前美国海军军官、美国新安全中心高级研究员托马斯·H·舒加特三世（Thomas H. Shugart III）也持有同样的看法，他表示，中国给予了柬埔寨的海军基地全力支持。 托马斯对BBC说：“我认为这是中国建造的，因为这些建筑让我想起我在中国海外基地吉布提和东南亚人工岛上看到的建筑。以目前的建设速度和规模，柬埔寨没有足够的能力完成。” 托马斯指出，云壤西部新建码头看起来与中国人民解放军在非洲吉布提的保障基地码头相似。 中国人民解放军驻吉布提保障基地和柬埔寨云壤海军基地对比图 “关于基地的其余部分，据传，属于中国部分的规模也与中国人民解放军在吉布提的基地规模大致相当，”托马斯补充说。 观察：中国在吉布提设军事基地干什么？ 然而，托马斯指出，他没有足够的证据向中国政府证实他的分析，因为这些只是通过卫星图像得出的。 BBC已联系中国国防部、中国外交部和柬埔寨国防部进行评论，但尚未收到任何回复。 然而，在其它地方，中国和柬埔寨均否认云壤是中国专用的海军基地。 根据中国大使王文天在奠基仪式上的讲话，中国对云壤海军基地升级项目的援助“符合两国国内法律、相关国际法律和国际惯例，不针对任何第三方”。 “中国军队将继续向柬埔寨军队提供力所能及的援助，促进两国军事合作的不断推进，达到新的水平和新进展。” 柬埔寨当地媒体表示，允许外国长年在其领土上建立基地违反了柬埔寨宪法第53条。但柬埔寨前总理洪森和其长子、现任总理洪玛奈一直向当地媒体否认这一说法。 柬埔寨宪法第53条禁止外国在其领土上建立军事基地。 第55条还规定，条约或协议应保障柬埔寨的独立、主权、领土完整、中立性和国家统一。 BBC对基地的五个区域进行的观察发现：北部、中部、东部、东南部和南部每个区域都呈现出快速扩建的趋势 。 云壤基地新建筑群 在东部，从2022年6月到12月仅仅六个月的时间，柬埔寨政府清理了大约24英亩的土地，并开始堆放一些混凝土。一年后，已经建起了四栋大楼。 托马斯认为“这可能是营房（右边两栋）或行政建筑（左边两栋），中间有一个运动场，旁边的两栋直角形建筑似乎是停车场或车辆存储地/车库”。 2023年8月到12月期间，在同一区域他们还建造了四个油罐，然后在2024年4月底将它们涂成蓝色。 在基地的中部，他们从2023年3月开始建造一个新的码头，并于2023年10月完工。两个月后，上述两艘船只停靠在码头上，至少停留了七个月，直到2024年6月。 柬埔寨政府拆除了云壤海军基地北部的旧建筑 他们从东北部开始清理土地。自2022年6月以来的大约两年时间里，他们已经建起了四栋大楼、四栋小楼和一些未知设施。 从2024年2月到6月，柬方似乎在沿海地区拆除旧建筑，并计划建造其他建筑。他们还开辟一些新路径。 大规模整理土地并在云壤海军基地南面新建一座码头 2023年10月，他们在南部清理了一些土地，随后几个月进行了填海造地工作。一年后，混凝土被铺设在那里，一些驳船似乎在新建的码头处进行着什么工作。托马斯说：“可能是运送建筑材料或其他东西来回穿梭。”2024年6月，卫星图像显示出一个新的U形码头。 在东南部，一片清理过的土地上共建起了六栋建筑。随着建筑的扩建，新修的道路清晰可见。小楼扩建旁边还有一些小的单元。 “正在建造的东西与2019年 泄露给媒体的谅解备忘录 (MOU)显示了相似之处。借助中国的技术基础设施和工人，基地面积的三分之一将用于柬埔寨海军，基地北部的三分之二将留给中国独家使用，”波林说。 “他们希望我们关注基地的南部那三分之一，并忽略北部保留为中国独家使用的其余三分之二。” “中国军人可能驻扎在基地” 疑似中国军舰在该基地停留数月引发争议。波林告诉《日经新闻》称，有可能这些护卫舰搭载了士兵进行“轮换或长期驻扎”。 “这意味着在过去的五个月里可能有中国士兵驻扎在这个基地。” 上述匿名军事情报分析员告诉BBC，两艘中国江岛级护卫舰于2023年12月1日首次停靠在云壤，和亚洲自由电台（Radio Free Asia）报道的他们在2023年12月3日抵达参加军事联合演习比起来要更早两天。 2023年12月1日至2024年5月19日，这两艘护卫舰只离开云壤三次，它们总是成对移动，“在任何时候都不会有一艘船在场而另一艘不在”。 2024年6月12日，尽管中国和柬埔寨联合演习已于2024年5月底结束，这些军舰仍停留在那里。 “这些是江岛级护卫舰，长90米，最大宽度11.14米，”该分析员告诉BBC。 2023年12月初，柬埔寨国防部长在其 脸书帖子 上确认，这些船只帮助柬埔寨海军准备联合军事训练。然而，在5月的联合军演结束后，它们似乎待了更长时间。 江岛级护卫舰 根据《高棉时报》的 报道 ，早在2020年，即这些护卫舰出现之前，柬埔寨前总理洪森就有承诺，柬埔寨政府将允许所有军舰停靠新建的现代化海军云壤基地。 “关于对云壤基地的使用权，我想声明，我们欢迎来自所有国家的船只，包括美国、法国、加拿大、印度、英国、日本、澳大利亚，而不仅仅是中国，来港口停靠或与柬埔寨共同参加演习。声称柬埔寨已经授予中国50至90年独家使用权这一说法毫无根据。” 然而，就近期中国对该基地的独家使用权问题，值得注意的是根据《高棉时报》报道，2024年2月，两艘日本海上自卫队的驱逐舰在西哈努克港、而不是云壤基地的自主港口停靠了2天。 2023年12月到2024年6月雲壤基地出現中國江島級輕護衛艦 2023年12月1日 來源：BlackSky @-moz-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-moz-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-moz-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-webkit-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-ms-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-ms-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-ms-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes gel-spin{0%{transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.bbc-news-visual-journalism-loading-spinner{display:block;margin:8px auto;width:32px;height:32px;max-width:32px;fill:#323232;-webkit-animation-name:gel-spin;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-webkit-animation-timing-function:linear;-moz-animation-name:gel-spin;-moz-animation-duration:1s;-moz-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-moz-animation-timing-function:linear;animation-name:gel-spin;animation-duration:1s;animation-iteration-count:infinite;animation-timing-function:linear} ﻿.bbc-news-vj-wrapper{font-family:\"Heiti SC\", \"黑体\", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif} 为什么中国的存在对其他国家发出了警告？ 根据美国国防部丹尼尔·K·伊诺耶亚太安全研究中心（Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies of the US Department of Defense）的亚历山大·L·维文教授（Alexander L Vuving）的说法，通过在西部的云壤基地和东部的南沙群岛掌握双向通道，也就是在中国南部海域的纷争岛之间，中国可以完全控制一个非常广阔的区域，包括整个东南亚地区的中心。 “也就是说有了一个可以实时观测监控当下发生的所有事情的雷达，更别提还有一个基地来指挥船只和车辆来控制领空、海域或附近地区了。这也是一种可能性，”维文说。 中国解放军筹划打造“全球后勤补给网”令五角大楼担忧 中国一直在南海实施灰色地带战术——这是军事术语，指的是在战争和和平之间周旋的策略，在不实施武装力量的情况下实现在当地的利益最大化。 “南海冲突不符合中国的利益。如果发生南海冲突，美国可能会作为菲律宾的盟国介入，那么对中国来说事情将变得非常棘手。”维文补充道。 美国军队在菲律宾有外国军事基地。现在随着中国在云壤基地的存在，中国可以部署民兵、军力并拦截信息。 与此观点相同，东亚政治分析师、昆士兰大学讲师艾哈迈德·乌马尔（Ahmad Umar）表示，中国在该基地的存在可能激怒其它邻国。 “首先，中国可以干扰卫星传输消息，其次，这可能破坏该地区的稳定，无法和平解决南海冲突。这也可能引发灾难性后果，不仅威胁到地区的稳定，也威胁到中美关系甚至台湾冲突。”乌马尔告诉BBC。 乌马尔认为，中国决定不将云壤宣布为其海军基地是一种军事战略，目的是阻止美国在中台冲突爆发时支持台湾。 一种转变：从美国到中国 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion 在中国获得使用基地的权利很久以前，美国一直是柬埔寨军方的积极合作伙伴。自2010年以来，美国在军事设施的北部资助了两栋建筑，并与柬埔寨共同进行军事训练。 然而在2017年，就在两国联合协作的年度训练之前，柬埔寨突然宣布暂停这项已经持续多年的合作。 2019年，有关中国和柬埔寨关于云壤基地的协议文件被泄露给媒体，并被《华尔街日报》报道。根据文件，柬埔寨允许中国军队使用该基地北半部长达30年，并在此期满后自动续约。 2020年，日经亚洲报道称，一栋由美国资助的建筑被拆除，为中国的新建设让路。 2021年6月，美国副国务卿温迪·谢尔曼（Wendy Sherman）在访问柬埔寨时，他对中国军方的存在、美国资助建筑被强拆以及在云壤海军基地设施的情况表示高度担忧。 在美国政府网站上的一份声明中，谢尔曼表示，“中华人民共和国在柬埔寨设立军事基地将损害柬埔寨的主权，威胁地区安全，并对美柬关系产生负面影响。” 在会议之后，美国国防武官马库斯·M·费拉拉上校（Marcus M. Ferrara）被邀请到基地。然而，他没有完全访问权。对此，柬埔寨政府发言人菲·西潘（Phay Siphan）回应称，他们可以基于国家安全和领土完整的理由限制访问。 “问题在于柬埔寨的行动缺乏透明度。没有人知道哪些区域是为中国保留的，因为柬埔寨和中国都没有宣布。尽管柬埔寨方面总是说他们永远不会让外国在他们的国家建立军事基地，但关于这一点的真相是未知的，”维文在接受BBC采访时表示。 来自柬埔寨未来论坛的研究员安诚波（Chhengpor Aun）告诉BBC：“这种情况（柬埔寨承接外国海军基地）将需要柬埔寨宪法的改变，这可能会引起国内和国际的强烈反对。我不认为柬埔寨政府会冒这个风险，但我无法推测整个大背景下可能会存在的其他安排。” “如果成功升级和适当部署，云壤将在柬埔寨海军防御中发挥核心作用，以加强对泰国湾的海上主权，并为该国对海上安全日益积极的贡献提供支持。” 经过两年的快速发展，中国和柬埔寨一直在积极利用这一基地进行联合军事演习——在六个月内进行了两次。 根据柬埔寨国防部，最近的演习涉及2075名士兵和武器，包括来自柬埔寨的1315名士兵和中国武装部队的760名士兵。 中国和柬埔寨的关系越来越紧密。波林怀疑柬埔寨政府邀请中国到基地的隐藏议程是由腐败政府推动的。 “柬埔寨越来越倾向于中国这一现实源于柬埔寨人民党（CPP）领导的政权，现在洪玛奈基本上正在实行盗窃统治——他们正在寻找赞助商，需要资金来维持体系。如果资金耗尽，该党将崩溃，”波林对BBC说。 “中国是他们唯一可以赚钱的地方。只要中国继续向柬埔寨注入资金，不管洪森、洪玛奈喜欢与否，他们别无选择，只能继续成为北京的客户。” 然而，他补充道：“这并不意味着柬埔寨将永远被中国逼入困境。我认为柬埔寨人民越来越怀疑中国，并将中国视为腐败之源。” “因此，只有在洪森和洪玛奈掌权期间，这个网络才能生存下去。” 制图：Aghnia Adzkia, Andro Saini, Arvin Supriyadi and Ayu Idjaja",

    "description": "5 分钟前 图像来源， Peter Cziborra/REUTERS 中华台北队女拳手林郁婷 在巴黎奥运，女子拳击选手接连陷入性别争议风波，包括阿尔及利亚代表凯莉芙（Imane Khelif）及来自台湾的林郁婷。 她们去年曾遭国际拳击协会（IBA）取消资格，理由是未能通过性别测试，指她们有XY染色体。但国际奥委会（IOC）称，国际拳击协会作出相关决定时，没有任何正当程序。 国际奥委会主席巴赫（Thomas Bach）公開为两名选手辩护，呼吁停止仇恨言论。 “我们有两位拳击手，她们作为女性出生，作为女性成长，拥有女性护照，并作为女性参加了多年的比赛。”他説。“这就是女性的明确定义。她们作为女性的身份从未有过任何疑问。” 乔安娜·哈珀：运动员、科学家和致力保障女子体育的跨性别者 东京奥运：位于话题中心的跨性别举重选手哈伯德 巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间 赛场上发生什麽？ 28岁的台湾（以中华台北队名义参赛）拳击手林郁婷，周四（8月2日）在其首场奥运比赛中胜出。 她在欢呼声中进入赛场，并於女子57公斤级8强赛事赢了乌兹别克选手图尔迪别科娃（Sitora Turdibekova），现场传出一些嘘声。 图像来源， Ueslei Marcelino/REUTERS 这场赛事打满了三个回合，两人打完短暂握手，但在五名裁判一致判定林郁婷获胜后，她们没有再握手。 图尔迪贝科娃流泪离开赛场，没有停下来接受媒体采访，和她的团队迅速离开赛场。林郁婷则短暂停留，没有回答问题。 台湾媒体引述林郁婷的教练曾自强表示，希望林郁婷不要受外界打扰，不走进采访区，“外国媒体想问相关问题，她不知怎麽回答，有点吓到了”。 此前，阿尔及利亚选手凯莉芙（Imane Khelif）在女子66公斤16强赛事，赢了意大利选手卡里尼（Angela Carini）。 图像来源， YAHYA ARHAB/EPA-EFE 後者在比赛第46秒时宣布弃赛，她拒绝与对手握手，在赛场上跪地落泪，赛後表示“我必须保住自己的生命”。 但卡里尼翌日向对手道歉，称“如果国际奥委会说她可以比赛，我尊重这个决定”。 国际拳协与国际奥委会之争 这次性别风波背後，是国际拳击协会（IBA）与国际奥委会（IOC）之争。 去年3月，有俄罗斯背景的国际拳协在世界锦标赛称林郁婷和凯莉芙“不符合规则”，取消她们的资格。林郁婷的铜牌因此被剥夺。 国际拳协当时称，此举是“为了维护比赛的公平性和最高诚信度”。俄籍主席克里姆列夫（Umar Kremlev）对俄罗斯媒体表示，该会发现有关运动员有XY染色体。 但该判决引发外界质疑，国际拳协进行了“单独且公认的测试”，但一直没有说明是哪种测试，也没有让她们接受睾固酮素检查──睾固酮是男女都有的性激素，而成年男性的睾固酮水平约是成年女性的10到20倍。 到了去年6月，国际拳协因管理不善、贪污等指控，被国际奥委会取消其世界认可地位，奥运拳击赛事改为由国际奥委会自行主持。 不过，国际奥委会上周仍在其网站仍一度引述国际拳协对林郁婷的性别质疑，几天之后才删除相关内容。 上周初，国际奥委会在其媒体信息门户网站上表示，林未能通过“基于生化测试结果的资格要求”。该网站还提到：“这是自国际拳协开始使用新测试方法以来，首次有中华台北运动员被要求进行性别资格的生化测试。” 然而，国际奥委会在几天之后删除了这些信息。 国际奥委会在周四的一份声明中表示，凯莉芙和林成为了“国际拳协突如其来且武断决定的受害者”。 声明指出：“在2023年国际拳协世界锦标赛接近尾声时，他们在没有任何正当程序的情况下突然被取消资格。” “根据国际拳协网站上的会议记录，这一决定最初是由国际拳协秘书长和行政总裁单独做出的。国际拳协董事会仅在事后才批准了该决定，并随后要求在未来类似情况中制定和反映在国际拳协规章中的程序。记录还指出，国际拳协应该‘建立一个明确的性别测试程序’。 “对这两名运动员的当前攻击完全基于这一武断的决定，这一决定是在没有任何正当程序的情况下做出的，尤其是考虑到这些运动员已经参加高水平比赛多年。 “这种做法违反了良好治理原则。” 国际奥委会是根据运动员护照来定义性别。在争议声中，国际奥委会主席巴赫8月3日为两位拳手辩护，表示从没怀疑两人是女性。 图像来源， Carlos Perez Gallardo/REUTERS 巴赫说现在看到的是，有些人想要拥有女性的定义。“我只能请他们提出一个基于科学、新的女性定义。为什么一个出生、成长、参加比赛并拥有女性护照的人不能被视为女性？” 他强调国际奥委会愿意倾听，愿意调查，“但我们不会参与出于政治动机的文化战争”，又指社交媒体上一切“仇恨言论”和政治动机引发的辱骂完全不可接受。 一些台湾媒体去年报道称，林郁婷未通过测试是由于“体重控制和月经周期”药物影响了荷尔蒙水平。 “我男变女，喜欢女生，一点不柔弱”：专访香港罕有跨性别武术家 林郁婷是谁？ 28岁的林郁婷身高175厘米，至今取得40胜14负，曾三次获得世锦赛奖牌，两次获得亚洲冠军。 图像来源， Peter Cziborra/REUTERS 台湾媒体报道，林郁婷1995年出生於新北莺歌，小时候和哥哥一起观看日本知名拳击动漫《第一神拳》，主角幕之内一步本来是性格懦弱、受霸凌的高中生，後来转变成为职业拳王。林郁婷受啓发，从练田径转为练拳击。 而她的教练曾自强曾经透露， 林出身於家暴家庭，她希望保护母亲而学习拳击。 她留短头发、打扮中性，去年被国际拳协剥夺铜牌后曾形容，自己好像岳飞被冠上了莫须有罪名。 “我参与这个协会的比赛那麽多次，光世锦赛就七次，怎麽只有这次说我有问题。不能因为我的长相打扮不同於传统女性的样貌，就这样对我。他们也没有公布检测过程，直接给出一张纸就说结果不符合，这就是违反流程的事。” 凯莉芙是谁？ 25岁的凯莉芙身高178厘米，从2018年开始参加比赛，以9胜5负的战绩进入巴黎赛。 她上届在东京首次参加奥运会，在八强赛事中输给爱尔兰选手哈灵顿（Kellie Harrington），当时她并没有被质疑性别。 去年她进入新德里的世锦赛决赛，但开赛前一天被主办方取消资格。 图像来源， Ramzi Boudina/REUTERS 凯莉芙父亲 这次在巴黎奥运再被质疑性别，凯莉芙的父亲对天空新闻表示：“我的孩子是个女孩。” “她从小就被当作女孩养大。她是一个坚强的女孩。我教育她要勤奋勇敢。她有很强的工作和训练意志。” 他向路透社表示，女儿从六岁起就热爱体育运动，以女儿为荣，并展示凯莉芙的出生证明文件说：“这是我们家的官方文件，1999 年5月2日，伊曼-凯莉芙，女。这里写着，你可以看一下，这份文件不会说谎。”",

    "description": "李澄欣 BBC中文记者 30 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 江旻憓（左）的教练是罗马尼亚的塔维（右）。 香港剑击队在巴黎奥运三天内夺两金，30岁的江旻憓先反胜东道主法国选手在女子重剑（Épée）封后，紧跟着27岁的张家朗卫冕男子花剑（Foil）金牌，成为68年来该项目卫冕第一人。 根据国际剑击联会（FIE）最新排名，香港运动员占据两个单项排名世界第一——江旻憓以总分262分保持女子世界一姐地位，张家朗则以252分重返男子世界第一。 香港人口仅700多万，却能持续出现世界一流剑手，站稳世界顶尖队伍之位。圈内人士称，全港习剑人数保守估计多达2万人，主要来自大中小学校队以及香港剑击总会旗下近50间私人剑校。 BBC中文采访多名剑击队运动员、教练和学者，拆解香港剑击运动的崛起缘由，并回溯这项运动如何从殖民地贵族项目发展成为今天在中产阶级普及的运动。 香港奥运代表团历史佳绩和未能摆脱的政治阴影 香港赢得久违奥运金牌 张家朗获得男子花剑冠军 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间 东西合璧的训练体系 “她一定没问题的。”江旻憓决赛落后法国对手时，在电视直播节目以运动员身分当旁述的朱嘉望淡定地说。 图像来源， Getty Images 她没有说错，江旻憓最终逆转胜夺金。朱嘉望接受BBC中文访问时说：“我当时这么坚定地说，是因为我很相信Vivian（江旻憓）的实力。我看过她跟同一位对手打过很多次，每一次都是前段落后、后面追赢。” 29岁的朱嘉望是江旻憓的队友，上届东京奥运她们首次打入奥运女子剑击团体赛，两人都是香港体育学院（体院）的全职精英运动员，每周训练六天共25至30小时，上午炼体能，下午进行对打和技术训练。 该队以前由华人担任教练，2011年总教练郑兆康上任后大幅改革，聘请一批欧洲世界级教练，包括张家朗的法国人教练Gregory Koenig（Greg）和江旻憓的罗马尼亚教练Octavian-Petru Zidaru（Tavi）。郑兆康形容，十多年来打下的基础，现在是“收成期”，朱嘉望也表示这彻底改变了队内训练文化，给运动员全新的思维。 “Greg的风格是给运动员多一些放松时间，但一练习就很专注和高强度，这样才更加平衡，让人更加享受到练习和比赛。Tavi的风格也是不会把你逼得好紧，反而较讲究技术和细节。” 图像来源， Getty Images 张家朗的教练是法国人格雷各（Gregory Koenig，Greg） 她说教练团队也有来自香港本地、中国大陆和韩国的亚洲人，亚洲教练较重视基本功，因此港队成员都有“教科书水平”的标准手势和步法，打剑速度也非常快，在此基础上接受欧洲教练的训练就更上一层楼。 “不同国籍的教练互相配合很重要，以我们女子重剑为例，Tavi用欧洲模式做主，而中国教练姜海涛会配合他，他更了解亚洲人的身高、体型特性，知道如何把欧洲那一套改良和应用在我们身上。”朱嘉望对BBC中文说，“这样我们东西方的优点都兼备，而始终剑击是欧洲主导的运动，熟悉欧洲人的思维就更适合打欧洲对手。” 在巴黎卫冕金牌的张家朗也曾受访透露，法国教练格雷各加盟港队的第一法则是“你必须open-minded（思维开放）”，他要求运动员改掉“苦练就是好”的观念，鼓励他们了解自己而不是盲目遵守规矩，这启发了张家朗打剑时不只看招式的表面，还要思考每一个“为什么”。 图像来源， Moonie Chu 从左到右依次为中国教练姜海涛、江旻憓、余缮妡、陈渭泠、朱嘉望以及罗马尼亚教练Tavi 心态与海外经验 张家朗在决赛对战意大利的马基（Filippo Macchi），对方及其教练在整场赛事都被指十分“火爆”，失分时手舞喧叫及向裁判施压。“决一剑”时，双方曾两度刺中对方，裁判判定攻击无效，直到第三剑才判张家朗获胜，过程充满戏剧性。 而江旻憓决赛对阵东道主法国的剑手玛露比顿（Auriane Mallo-Breton）时，现场法国观众呐喊声沸腾，法国总统马克龙也亲自到场观战，她在巨大压力下初段落后，三个回合后追平并“决一剑”胜出。 图像来源， Getty Images 两人能在短时间内调整心态被视为致胜关键，没有受现场气氛或对手情绪干扰。对此，同为港队成员的朱嘉望认为，除了教练的启发，体院的运动心理中心也应记一功。 她说该院有数名心理学家，其中两位负责照顾剑击队，经常在训练期间观察运动员的心理状态，并会随队一同去亚锦赛、世锦赛、奥运等重要赛事。 “我们和他经常见，他很熟悉我们，我们也随时可以找他聊天，是他教会了我冥想，怎样在高压环境下把专注力放在当下，这些思想的练习对于比赛帮助很大。”朱嘉望说，“因为剑击好像下棋，不是斗体力，更多的是斗智、斗心、斗经验，心理质素是关键。” 另一方面，香港剑击队非常重视海外交流，运动员每年要到海外参加七、八个比赛，包括剑击世锦赛、亚锦赛和世界杯，教练会在赛事之间安排为期两周至一个月的海外集训，每年至少四次，让运动员适应时差和累积国际经验。 “所以我们经常去法国，每个剑击队成员都很熟悉巴黎。”朱嘉望笑道。 她说在海外集训也是跟着原有教练，但气氛会比平日更专注，也可以与各国对手切磋，并观摩其它国家教练的教法。“例如在去年世锦赛前的集训，一位日本教练带领了一个环节，教所有剑手脚法，我们学到以前从没学过的技巧。” 朱嘉望补充指，全世界的剑击队都有海外集训，是常态，但港队在这两届奥运前的预备时间里，明显投放了更多资源，“总教练安排给我们的集训多了很多，而成绩也反映出是值得的”。 殖民地时期的历史渊源 香港剑击队有今天的“收成期”，有赖过去几十年来播下的种子。而追溯剑击运动在香港的历史渊源，得回到港英时代。 图像来源， Getty Images 除了张家朗、江旻憓之外，香港还有年轻剑手崭露头角，例如19岁新星陈诺斯（前排右二）。 剑击是欧洲运动，香港作为前英国殖民地，二战前已有剑击爱好者，主要是洋人，一批葡藉剑手在二战期间移居澳门并接受前葡萄牙奥运选手训练，战后回流香港，其后在港的英军剑手也开始参与本地剑击活动，促成1949年成立香港业余剑击总会，并获加入英联邦剑击协会。 上世纪五十年代，这项运动慢慢打进华人精英阶层，喇沙、拔萃等由教会办学的传统名校陆续成立剑击校队，1960年举办第一届校际剑击比赛，带动其它名校的剑击风潮。 “英国人到海外拓展殖民地，都会把英国的运动文化输出去，包括剑击、足球、羽毛球等，而这些变成英联邦体育文化，香港受影响很深。”香港教育大学健康与体育学系高级讲师雷雄德博士对BBC中文说。 这些传统名校可说是香港第一代剑击运动员的摇篮，以剑击闻名的前财政司司长曾俊华，就是60年代初中就读喇沙书院时首次接触剑击。 他高中移居美国后继续学剑，大学时曾任麻省理工学院读书剑击队队长，80年代回港后到母校喇沙担任义务剑击教练，一教就是30年，不少港队现役剑手都曾是他的学生，包括曾出战上届东京奥运、目前世界排名第20的男子花剑运动员蔡俊彦。 时至今日，会剑击的小孩报读名校时仍可获加分，足见剑击在香港精英阶层的传统地位。 而剑击从上世纪六七十年代的名校小圈子运动，到八十年代逐渐普及化，转捩点也跟殖民地政策息息相关。 “二战前后，各国把体育纳入国家政策，关乎教育、生产力、军事训练和国家荣誉。但香港不是一个国家，殖民地政府也不重视体育，情况在六七暴动后改变。”雷雄德博士说。 1967年“六七暴动”后港英政府改变治港方针，引入多项社会改革，开始重视青年政策并注重体育发展，举办包含竞技比赛在内的“香港节”，1973年成立康乐体育局。 “政府认为年轻人太多‘剩余精力’无处发泄才会参与暴动，所以开始推广体育。英国政府在处理英国本土青年犯罪问题时也是这个思维。”雷雄德博士说，“在学术上，体育本身就有凝聚社会的功能，可以净化社会不安。” 两万剑手的城市 1982年，港英政府与赛马会合资在沙田成立银禧体育中心，即香港体育学院前身，负责培训精英运动员及推广体育活动，成立之初剑击已是九个重点项目之一，正式把剑击带到社区。 图像来源， Getty Images 雷雄德忆述，他上世纪八十年代初刚从师范学院体育系毕业，曾参加教育司署与银禧合办给体育教师的课程，进修冷门项目如剑击、独木舟、射击等。“教师学会了，带回一般的中小学，基层学生才接触到，造就年轻人有兴趣。现在的剑击总会高层当初也是这样学剑的。” 与此同时，银禧训练出一批精英剑击运动员，九十年代退役后成为教练人才，纷纷在民间开办私人剑击学校。 53岁的前剑击港队成员李永强就是其中一人，他1998年曾代表香港出战亚运会，退役后担任教练，2012年开办私人剑校香港剑击学院，见证着剑击社群壮大。“我30年前玩剑击，全香港才500多人，现在只是一个小学学界比赛已经有两三千人。” 他对BBC中文指出，以前剑击是贵族活动，但随着香港经济起飞、中产阶级崛起，可负担的家庭越来越多，小孩也越来越早开始学习，从中学阶段逐渐提前至小学、幼稚园，最早的甚至3岁就开始学。他说以中小学学界比赛分别有两三千人参加，加上幼儿、大专和成人，保守估计目前全港习剑人数多达2万人。 “张家朗也是这样出来，基层越多人玩、越早开始玩，我们选材基础就越扩大，选出来的精英就越强。体院集中训练精英，私人剑校负责基层推广，这30年来做了很好的分工，建立了整个系统——所以金牌不是突然冒出来的，是三代人的努力。” 新一代剑手 香港剑击运动的成就能否持续，要靠第四代人的努力。张家朗在巴黎奥运卫冕后受访时说，香港是个很小的城市，但“只要相信自己，不要因为（生于）一个很小的地方而放弃”。 图像来源， Getty Images 和他同代学剑的年轻教练贺扬则认为，正正是香港地方小，有很大优势，参加比赛很方便。 “外国地方大，小孩要去别的剑会比赛，可能要整个家庭一起出行、去好几天，但香港胜在够密集，一个尖沙咀已经有六七间剑校，就算去澳门或内地也很近，可以当天来回，这样我们的比赛经验相比其他国家的人更丰富。” 三年前东京奥运后的张家朗效应，让香港剑校如雨后春筍，目前香港剑击总会旗下属会有近50家。 贺扬也是在两年前创办剑校英汇剑击学院，他说他这一辈人棒做社区推广，开始革新教学模式，“不想像以前那种高压教育，把小孩逼得很紧，反而是营造快乐打剑的气氛”。他又认为新一代的剑校文化已经改变，更愿意互相合作，相信可吸引更多人投身剑击运动。 “我小时候学剑的体验很差，你愿意给钱他都未必肯教，就算教也是挤牙膏式，山头主义很严重。但我们这一代，成长于网络时代，所有资讯都很透明，更加愿意分享资源和合作，这样对整个剑击界都有好处。” 除了私人剑击学校，一般的中小学也对剑击持更开放态度。 本身是剑击教练的何莉恺在新界沙田区一家中学任教，她一年前在校内成立剑击队，目前有13人。她说当初向校长提出建议后，校方爽快答应。 图像来源， AFP “首先要多谢张家朗效应，让所有香港人认识了剑击。”她笑道。 “其次是用成本说服校长，其实剑击没有大家想像中那麽贵，教练费跟篮球队差不多，场地一个羽毛球场已经符合要求，只是买个裁判器，一般学校都可以承担。” 她补充指，自从国际剑联认可中国制造的服装和器材，市面上已有大量平价装备可供选择，投身剑击的门槛大大降低，现在背景较基层的南亚裔学生也积极参与，种族更多元化。 对此，学者雷雄德和前港队成员李永强都表示乐见，相信随着基层选手人数增多、种族更多元，香港剑击队将一代胜过一代。 “其实现在的学生，已经比张家朗小时候更厉害，以后的成绩非常令人期待。”李永强说。",

    "description": "12 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 拜登看着格什克维奇在抵达美国后给母亲一个大大的拥抱。 包括《华尔街日报》记者伊凡·格什科维奇（Evan Gershkovich）在内的三名美国人在与俄罗斯进行的囚犯交换协议中获释。美国囚犯都已安全返回美国领土。美国总统拜登（Joe Biden）和副总统卡马拉·哈里斯（kamala harris）亲自前往机场迎接他们，获释囚犯每个人都与家人拥抱。 32岁的格什科维奇是从俄罗斯监狱被交换的16名囚犯之一。俄国并接回了8名在美服刑的俄罗斯囚犯。 此次被称为冷战结束以来美俄两国最大规模的换囚行动。 这个在土耳其机场进行的换囚行动释放了前美国海军陆战队员保罗·惠伦（Paul Whelan）以及拥有俄美双重国籍的另一名记者阿尔苏·库尔马谢娃（Alsu Kurmasheva）。 在抵达马里兰州的美军安德鲁联合基地后，格什科维奇等三人从飞机上走下来，受到现场人员的热烈欢呼。 他们在机场跑道上停留拍照和交谈，不到一小时就离开了空军基地。拜登的车队也随后离开。 在他们返回美国之际，拜登在机场欢迎他们获释归来，并称“他们受的残酷折磨已经结束了”。 拜登在现场说：“想像一下，若你被不公平地扣押而你的孩子就在家里，你会有什么感受？” 他又补充称“想像在监狱里，不知何时才能回家。不知道孩子们的状况，他们晚上是否哭着入睡？每天你不在他们身边都是如何度过的？这些都很重要。” 拜登亦赞扬了美国盟友特别是德国和斯洛文尼亚所发挥的作用，并将格什科维奇等三人获释以及克里姆林宫批评人士弗拉基米尔·卡拉-穆尔扎（Vladimir Kara-Murza）的释放称为“外交成就”。 三名获释的美国公民将被送往德州的布鲁克陆军医院进行健康检查。 美伊完成换囚：美国解冻60亿美元伊朗资金，五名被押美公民飞离伊朗 美俄换囚 女篮明星与“死亡商人”各自获释返国 普京80年代的东德特工证件在德国曝光 澳大利亚华裔记者成蕾获释回国 曾遭“泄密”指控和判刑 图像来源， US Government 白宫发布的照片显示格什科维奇(左)、库尔马谢娃(右)和惠伦(右二)等人在从俄罗斯被囚中获释后登上飞机。 谈判历时18个月 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion 事实上，此次交换协议的谈判历时超过18个月。 关键在于莫斯科要求返还在德国服刑的俄国杀手瓦季姆·克拉西科夫（瓦迪姆·克拉西科夫）。他被指控曾在柏林市中心公园被毒杀流亡海外的前车臣叛军指挥官甘戈什维利（Zelimkhan Khangoshvili）。 克拉西科夫现已返回俄罗斯。 土耳其总统府则称，共有24名来自7个不同国家的囚犯在土耳其安卡拉交换，其中包括美国、德国、波兰、斯洛文尼亚、挪威、俄罗斯和白俄罗斯的囚犯。其中10人（包括2名未成年人）被遣返至俄罗斯，13名囚犯被送至德国，3人送抵美国。 在俄罗斯，普京在莫斯科机场亲自用花束迎接获释的俄罗斯人。他在红毯上热情地拥抱了他们，并表示他们将获得国家奖励。除了克拉西科夫，还有一对在斯洛维尼亚被判间谍罪的俄罗斯夫妇，他们和两个孩子一起返回俄罗斯。 北约和欧洲联盟都欢迎这次释放并称这是由土耳其斡旋达成的。德国公民李科·克里格尔（Rico Krieger）此前在白俄罗斯被判处死刑，但本周白俄罗斯领导人卢卡申科对他进行了赦免，他也已获释。 事实上，此前关于交换囚犯的讨论曾包括当时被监禁的俄罗斯反对派领袖阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexander Lukashenkoe）。但是当他在今年2月份于北极监狱以不明原因去世时，此交换方案濒临报废。他的遗孀尤利娅·纳瓦尔娜（Yulia Navalnaya）称此次换囚让她感到欣喜。 在换囚前几天就有消息传出各国即将进行的一次重大换囚。而且在此之前，数名在俄罗斯被监禁的异见人士和记者被从监狱转移到不明地点。尽管俄罗斯秘密转移囚犯较常见，但知名的囚犯大量失踪并不寻常。 过去最近一次高调换囚发生在2022年12月。当时美国篮球明星布兰妮·格莱纳（Brittney Griner）在阿布达比机场被交换回美国，莫斯科换回了在美监狱服刑12年的俄罗斯军火商维克多·布特（Viktor Bout）。 上一次类似的换囚发生在2010年的维也纳。当时10名在美国被捕的俄罗斯间谍与4名涉嫌在俄罗斯担任双重间谍的人交换。其中一人是前军事情报官员谢尔盖·斯克里帕尔（Sergei Skripa），他在2018年被毒杀于英格兰西南索尔兹伯里市（Salisbury）。 近年来莫斯科与西方的紧张局势不断升高，尤其是自2022年2月普京发动入侵乌克兰以来。 图像来源， Getty Images 2023 年 10 月在喀山被拘留的记者库尔马舍娃 (Alsu Kurmasheva) 在女儿们之间 分析：可能不会是最后一次 BBC俄罗斯事务编辑史蒂夫·罗森伯格（Steve Rosenberg） 这是自冷战以来最大规模的东西方囚犯交换。西方政府将欢迎国人获释，以及俄罗斯一些最著名的政治犯获得自由。莫斯科则将庆祝其特工的归来。 双方都会声称这是一笔好交易。 但如果俄罗斯像过去一样认定“人质外交”可行，令人担忧的是这种利用囚犯作为筹码的做法可能不会是最后一次。",

    "title": "巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-69236684",
    "description": "黄思琪（Kelly Ng） BBC记者 35 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 汤慕涵是征战巴黎奥运会的中国队31名游泳选手之一。 世界反兴奋剂机构（WADA）表示，由于中美两国的地缘政治紧张局势蔓延到奥运会舞台，该机构被“不公平地卷入”中美之间的争执中。 在遭遇一系列兴奋剂指控之后，中国的顶尖游泳运动员被置于聚光灯下，随后美国声称世界反兴奋剂机构掩盖此事，这引起了争议。 前往巴黎参赛的中国游泳运动员接受药检的次数是一些其他国家选手的两倍，这反过来又引发了对中国运动员受到阴谋干扰的指控。 世界反兴奋剂机构在周二的声明中说，它被卷入了“超级大国之间的地缘政治紧张局势，但却只能置身事外”。 “（美国）某些人纯粹是想通过这些涉事运动员是中国人来捞取政治筹码。”世界反兴奋剂机构媒体关系总监詹姆斯·菲茨杰拉德（James Fitzgerald）对BBC说。“结果是，这在反兴奋剂系统内部造成了不信任和分裂。” 贸易战、地缘政治对抗以及北京与俄罗斯的友好关系已经使中美这两大经济体的关系恶化。 在竞技体育中出现这样的紧张情势并不奇怪，但现在它们似乎正在引发一场更强硬和严厉的对立。 上周，世界反兴奋剂机构表示，它正在考虑就“诽谤性”指控对美国反兴奋剂机构（USADA）采取法律行动。 后者指责世界反兴奋剂机构和中国反兴奋剂中心（Chinada）是“掩盖阳性检测结果和压制勇敢举报人声音的黑手”之一。 美国议员也指责世界反兴奋剂机构未能妥善调查针对中国游泳运动员的兴奋剂指控。本周二，他们提出了一项法案，赋予白宫削减该机构资金的权力。 “当国会议员和参议员们把自己融入反兴奋剂这个技术性很强的领域时，这就不再是科学和法律分析的问题，而是滑向了政治领域。”菲茨杰拉德说。 受污染食品和营养补充剂 在世界反兴奋剂机构周二发表声明之前，《纽约时报》报道了一起此前未公开的案件，涉及两名中国游泳运动员，其中包括一名今年的奥运代表队成员，他们因涉嫌服用兴奋剂而受到调查。 他们在2022年被检测出体内一种禁用类固醇呈阳性，但他们被允许参加比赛。中国反兴奋剂中心的结论是，这两名运动员很可能是在食用受污染的汉堡时，在不知情的情况下摄入了类固醇。 美国反兴奋剂机构指责世界反兴奋剂机构让中国“在一套不同的规则下比赛，使赛场向他们倾斜”。 但世界反兴奋剂机构为这一说法进行了辩护。该机构称，运动员的营养补充剂和毛发检测结果均为阴性，两名游泳运动员在一次检测呈阳性前后几天提供的对照样本也均为阴性。 它补充说，这两名游泳运动员被禁赛一年多，然后便结案了。 该机构说，他们的案件是“涉及来自不同运动项目的（中国）运动员的一系列更广泛案例”的一部分，并补充称，“根据案例数量，显然在全球多个国家都存在污染问题”。 在6月的一份声明中，世界反兴奋剂机构指出，吃肉的运动员如果摄入了瘦肉精，有时会出现药检呈阳性的情况。瘦肉精是一种被禁用的物质，被用作家畜的生长促进剂。 在回答《纽约时报》的问题时，该机构表示正在调查中国以及墨西哥、危地马拉和其他国家的污染事件。 巴黎奥运2024：奖牌榜上哪个国家或地区领先？ 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 巴黎奥运会开幕式如何与众不同？这些是目前已知的要点 巴黎奥运：从性别平等、独特开幕式到俄罗斯运动员，你可能忽略的一些重要细节 图像来源， Getty Images 美国官员指责世界反兴奋剂机构“不公平地”偏袒中国游泳运动员。 巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？ 巴黎被指为奥运清理流浪者：“这对难民来说是一场噩梦” 该机构的负责人奥利维尔·尼格里（Olivier Niggli）当时指出，美国媒体“只问有关中国的问题，而肉类污染在许多国家都是个问题”，并提到“有人试图将反兴奋剂政治化”。 今年4月，《纽约时报》报道称，在2021年东京奥运会前几个月，23名中国游泳运动员在被检测是否服用提高成绩的药物时呈阳性，这掀起了轩然大波。 但在中国官员发现药检结果是由污染造成后，他们获准参赛。这支30人的队伍在东京奥运会上赢得了六枚奖牌，包括三枚金牌。其中11名药检呈阳性的运动员还被选入出征巴黎奥运会的中国游泳队。 美国游泳运动员、11枚奥运奖牌得主凯蒂·莱德基（Katie Ledecky）曾表示，在23名中国游泳运动员药检阳性的消息传出后，她对反兴奋剂监管机构的信心降到了“历史最低点”。 然而，世界反兴奋剂机构的调查发现，它“无法否认污染的可能性”是这种治疗心脏病的药物曲美他嗪（TMZ）的来源。 该机构表示，有鉴于受检运动员中，“曲美他嗪的浓度一直很低，且没有服用兴奋剂的模式”，这些因素都支持了污染的可能性。也就是说，运动员们几天的测试结果不一致，在阴性和阳性之间摇摆。 一项独立调查发现，世界反兴奋剂机构没有处理不当，也没有对中国游泳运动员表现出偏向性。 美中巨头间的冲突 这些丑闻加大了反兴奋剂官员的压力，当中国游泳队抵达巴黎时，他们接受的药检远远超过了标准。 据负责监管水上运动的世界泳联（World Aquatics）称，自今年1月以来，中国游泳队的31名队员平均每人接受了21次不同反兴奋剂组织的药检。 相比之下，澳大利亚的41名游泳运动员平均接受了4次药检，美国的46名游泳运动员平均接受了6次药检。 这一系列检测引发了另一系列指控。中国官方报纸《环球时报》指责西方大国“滥用兴奋剂检测扰乱中国游泳队”。 图像来源， Getty Images 张雨霏在100米蝶泳比赛中获得铜牌。 上海一位国际政治学教授在接受《环球时报》采访时，指责美国主导了反兴奋剂规则。 沈毅称，“苛刻和不道德的检测”扰乱了中国队的训练，并称这是“奥运会的耻辱”。 保持着男子200米蛙泳世界纪录的中国游泳选手覃海洋说，这些药检表明“近几年中国游泳队的成绩让欧美强队感受到了威胁”。 “一些小把戏意图扰乱我们的备战节奏，摧毁我们的心理防线。但我们不会惧怕。”他在中国社交媒体平台微博上说。 覃海洋曾在去年的世锦赛上夺得50米、100米和200米蛙泳金牌，他在周日的男子100米蛙泳决赛中获得第七名。 中国前跳水冠军高敏也提出了同样的批评。她说，苛刻的测试“干扰了我们中国游泳队”，并称覃海洋的表现是“这两年所有比赛中最差的一次”。 中国目前的奖牌总数为一金两银两铜。 中国的“蝶后”张雨霏在东京奥运会上获得了100米蝶泳银牌。在周一，她为自己获得铜牌而流泪，但表示兴奋剂检测对她没有太大影响。 她说，虽然兴奋剂检测是“有点烦躁”，但更多的是“远远大于”想象的压力。 梁艳婷（Annabelle Liang）补充报道。",

    "title": "上半年经济形势堪忧 中共政治局会议传递了哪些信息",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-69234753",
    "description": "21 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 去年下半年尤其是四季度，中国经济增长较快，使今年下半年达到较高增速难度加大。 7月30日举行中共政治局会议主题是“分析研究当前经济形势，部署下半年经济工作”，中共高层表示要“坚定不移完成全年经济社会发展目标任务”。 对于中国经济而言，亟待回答的问题是，能否完成“5%左右”的全年经济增长目标？ 今年一季度，中国经济增长势头不错，GDP增速5.3%；第二季度却大幅低于各机构预测，仅为4.7%，使得上半年整体经济增速为5%，与全年目标持平。 专家表示 ，今年下半年的基数效应将有所减弱，使得通往5%的道路充满挑战，如果要实现这一目标，可能需要看到进一步的政策支持。 GDP增速是基于去年同期经济数据计算的增长速率，去年下半年尤其是四季度，中国经济增长较快，使今年下半年达到较高增速难度加大。 分析指出，这次政治局会议传递出的四个发力方向能否兑现，还需要进一步观察。 中国到底有没有“产能过剩”？为何事关欧美？ 欧盟打了中国最疼爱的“孩子”：对华电动车关税落地 最高48.1% 二十届三中全会：300多项改革出台 2029年中国人的生活将是什么样？ 宏观政策：刺激可能加力 宏观政策，通常指各国政府通过“货币政策”或“财政政策”来调节经济，通俗而言，就是“印钱”和“撒钱”。 对比4月30日的政治局会议，对下阶段宏观政策的表述明显不同：上次会议称“要靠前发力有效落实已经确定的宏观政策”；这次会议称“宏观政策要持续用力、更加给力”、“要加强逆周期调节”、“加大宏观调控力度”等。 安邦智库分析称，上次会议到这次会议之间，中国的宏观政策均处于观望期。这是因为此前美国尚未传递出明显的降息信号，中国降息空间没有打开。 但这一形势发生了变化，一方面二季度经济增速低于预期，中国需要在下半年切实提振经济以完成全年增长目标；另一方面市场估计美联储最近几月可能降息。 安邦智库认为，会议字里行间的表述意味着下半年积极的财政政策将通过发行更多的国债和地方债来完成，而在“防风险”和“稳增长”之间，财政政策真正能够“加力”的空间，仍需要依靠发行特别国债等“国债财政”来实现。 “外部压力的增加，包括特朗普的潜在回归，凸显了刺激国内经济的紧迫性。”经济学人智库（EIU）首席中国经济学家苏月向BBC中文表示，假定其它因素保持不变，特朗普上台后如果中国对美出口额外增加 10%的关税，会使中国2025和2026年的GDP 增长率平均下降0.3-0.4个百分点。那么更果断的国内政策和财政扩张才可减轻部分影响。 图像来源， Getty Image 中国经济形势发生了变化，一方面二季度经济增速低于预期，需要在下半年切实提振经济以完成全年增长目标；另一方面市场估计美联储最近几月可能降息。 安抚民营企业 2020年底，习近平在一次企业家座谈会上提到“弘扬企业家精神”。但之后新冠疫情中实施的严厉封控，以及政府先后对对房地产、互联网、教培等行业的强力监管，让很多民营企业的日子不好过，信心严重受损。 今年7月15日的二十届三中全会的文件中再次出现“企业家精神”，本次政治局会议则试图强调民营企业的重要性： 比如，防止和纠正一些地方利用行政、刑事手段干预经济纠纷；要有力有效支持发展瞪羚企业、独角兽企业；要弘扬企业家精神，在改革创新和公平竞争中加快建设更多世界一流企业。 苏月解释称，会议特别关注民营企业、高增长企业和独角兽企业，并再次强调保护产权。会议没有过多提及国有企业，这表明下半年的重点将放在民营企业上。 “会议旨在通过提出切实可行的改革措施，解决以往政策执行不力的问题。会议还强调要遏制地方政府利用行政和刑事手段干预经济纠纷，完善市场机制。”苏月预计，这些政策方向将对信心产生“轻微的积极影响”。 首提防“内卷式”恶性竞争 图像来源， Getty Image 近期中国官方避免使用“产能过剩”一词，而防“内卷式恶性竞争”首次出现在政治局会议的通稿中。 “内卷式”恶性竞争首次出现在政治局会议的通稿中——“要强化行业自律”，“强化市场优胜劣汰机制，畅通落后低效产能退出渠道”。 近期中国官方避免使用“产能过剩”来形容这一问题。 苏月称，“内卷式”恶性竞争的提法可以理解为官方对产能过剩问题的回应，有助于缓解贸易压力。 在今年4月之前，对“产能过剩”的讨论和担忧，广泛存在于中国自己的官方语境和媒体舆论中。 比如，去年年底召开的中央经济工作会议指出，进一步推动经济回升向好需要克服一些困难和挑战，其中即包括“部分行业产能过剩”。今年3月的“两会”上，政府工作报告对此予以重申。 而上一次“产能过剩”出现在中央经济工作会议上，还是五年前。 2023年末，中国汽车制造、计算机通信电子、纺织业、食品制造业、医药制造业和电气机械等行业的产能利用率，甚至低于2016年末。 到今年4月，“产能过剩”突然成为中国对外贸易的热词——4日到9日，美国财长耶伦访华，点名了三个中国的产业产能过剩，可能会伤害美国；16日，德国总理朔尔茨访华，再提对“产能过剩”的关切。到了7月，欧盟对中国电动车加征额外的关税。 此后，中国避免使用“产能过剩”来描述供给侧的问题，而开始强调防“内卷式”恶性竞争。 “这与此前电池、光伏退出落后产能的相关政策一脉相承，也是从中央层面上明确定调要实施供给侧改革。”安邦智库表示，在当下的经济低迷期，需求萎缩造成产能过剩，很多行业出现了所谓的“内卷式”恶性竞争，例如新能源车、光伏、锂电池等。 “不过，实施供给侧改革政策的主要考量何在？‘内卷’行业如何自律？过剩的产能如何出清？是否会通过技术标准以行政手段强行关停一些项目？以及是否会在信贷上收紧来强制出清竞争力不足的企业？这一系列后续仍有待观察。” 图像来源， Getty Image 分析指，在当下的经济低迷期，需求萎缩造成产能过剩，很多行业出现了所谓的“内卷式”恶性竞争。 如何拉动消费 此次会议频繁提及增加收入、促进消费。 会议指出，“要以提振消费为重点扩大国内需求，经济政策的着力点要更多转向惠民生、促消费，要多渠道增加居民收入，增强中低收入群体的消费能力和意愿，把服务消费作为消费扩容升级的重要抓手，支持文旅、养老、育幼、家政等消费。” “中央政府非常重视保持扶贫成果，并将重点放在对低收入群体的转移支付上。”不过，苏月提醒，中等收入家庭的收入增长乏力与房地产行业的困境息息相关，这凸显了制定以家庭为重点的财政政策的必要性。 安邦智库注意到，促进消费的重点将放在以文旅、养老、育幼、家政为代表的服务消费上，实际上服务业在就业结构中占据了很大一部分，推动服务消费也可以解决就业的问题。 “但就多渠道增加居民收入而言，通过哪些渠道？如何才能让老百姓增加收入？这些并未提及。”安邦智库分析认为，在消费这个问题上，采取修修补补的设备更新和智能化改造措施是没问题的，但要真正拉动“消费—收入”的循环链条，还要回归到能否扭转市场对未来经济的预期上。",

    "description": "28 分钟前 图像来源， EPA 哈马斯高层则表示该组织陷入了震惊状态。 伊朗指责以色列周三（7月31日）在首都德黑兰暗杀了哈马斯领导人伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚（Ismail Haniyeh）， 并威胁对以色列实施“严厉惩罚”。以色列并未直接对哈尼亚的死发表评论。 然而，以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡则称，近日他的国家对敌人“迎头重击”，在黎巴嫩击毙一名黎巴嫩真主党高级指挥官。 他向色列民众表示“艰难日子即将到来”，因为中东局势正在升温，对于该区域爆发更大规模军事冲突的忧虑越来越高。“自贝鲁特行动以来， 我们听到各方的威胁，”内塔尼亚胡在电视讲话中表示。 “我们已做好准备应对任何情况，我们将团结一致、坚定不移，”他强调。 不过，联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯警告不要让局势“危险升级”。 哈尼亚被杀重创以巴停火前景。哈马斯武装部门表示，被广泛视为该组织政治领袖的哈尼亚遇刺将“战斗推向新的境界”并造成重大影响。哈马斯去年10月7日在以色列境内发动攻击造成约1200人丧生。 此后，以色列誓言摧毁哈马斯。 哈马斯称领导人哈尼亚在伊朗遇刺身亡 誓言进行报复 中国站在以色列与哈马斯面前的三个问题 一文看懂巴以冲突关键角色：哈马斯是谁？ 以巴冲突：揭开哈马斯高层人物的面纱 哈尼亚在曾在加沙停火谈判中扮演重要角色。他在周三出席伊朗新总统梅赫迪·巴哈达德·岛加德就职仪式后不久遇害。 一名哈马斯高官向BBC强调，哈尼亚此次遇刺地点是他此前访问伊朗时曾停留过的同一栋大楼。当时还有3名哈马斯领导人和数名警卫与他同在这栋楼内。 哈马斯高层哈利勒·阿勒-哈亚在记者会上引述一名目击者的话称，一枚导弹直接命中了哈尼亚。 哈尼亚从20世纪80年代末开始成为哈马斯的重要成员。作为位于卡塔尔的政治局主席，他负责与地区政府的联系，也是哈马斯与德黑兰及其在中东地区的代理人组织之间的核心人物。数月来，他一直是以色列当局通缉的目标。BBC了解到，因为安全考虑，他最近一次前往黎巴嫩的行程被他的保安小组否决。 但是他很少参与哈马斯的军事行动，因此可能感到自己比一些同伙更能公开行动。这也反映在自10月7日以色列遭遇袭击事件后，他曾有过三次前往伊朗的行程。 根据报导，在哈尼亚遇袭身亡之前，关于他的继任问题已开始浮现。根据哈马斯的宪法，政治局主席最多只能连任两届，新的候选人原定于2025年选出。 图像来源， EPA 哈尼亚周二出现在伊朗议会。周三（7月31日）出席伊朗新总统就职仪式后不久遇害。 哈尼亚的去世可能会加速该组织内部的权力角力。阿拉伯外交官普遍认为，与其他哈马斯高层相比，哈尼亚是一个较为务实的人物。他主导了哈马斯与区域政府的政治接触，而非偏向军事行动。这种战略与穆罕默德·代夫等领导人的取向不同，因为后者领导着哈马斯的军事部门。就在本月初以色列声称在加沙的空袭击中了代夫，但未能证实其是否遇难。 一名哈马斯官员告诉BBC：“哈马斯是一个理念，是一种意识形态。领导人的被杀并不会改变它，亦不会让哈马斯投降或让步。” 这似乎是试图淡化组织内部可能存在的紧张局势。 此外，就在哈尼亚遭杀害前几个小时，以色列称，其已在贝鲁特击毙黎巴嫩真主党高级指挥官福阿德·舒库尔（Fuad Shukur）。以色列认为，他策划了上周末对戈兰高地发动的火箭弹攻击，这次袭击造成12人死亡。但真主党否认参与其中。 但真主党的报复是很可能发生的。因为这个受伊朗支持，实力强大的组织过去曾在领导人被杀害后，向以色列发射大量火箭弹作为回应。 美国已更新了对公民的旅行指引，警告他们说，因为“局势紧张升高”，不要前往黎巴嫩。英国外交大臣也敦促本国公民离开黎巴嫩。一些国际航空公司业已取消了飞往贝鲁特之航班。预计联合航空、达美航空和英国航空也将宣布暂停飞往以色列特拉维夫的班机。 图像来源， WAEL HAMZEH/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock 一名哈马斯高官向BBC强调哈尼亚此次遇刺地点是他此前访问伊朗时曾停留过的同一栋大楼。 分析：以色列的豪赌 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion BBC国际事务编辑杰里米·鲍文（Jeremy Bowen） 以色列给予其敌人两次重创。 虽然以色列并未承认他们在德黑兰杀害了哈马斯政治领袖伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚，但很难想到还有谁能比以色列更想要他的命。 至于黎巴嫩真主党指挥官富阿德·舒克尔，以色列则表示他在贝鲁特遭到一次“基于情报的消除行动”中丧生。 对以色列而言，哈马斯内部任何大人物都是他们猎杀的目标。因为去年10月7日哈马斯的攻击造成了自1948年以来以色列最惨重的单日伤亡。 以色列表示，杀害舒克尔是因为这位资深的真主党指挥官，要为导致12名儿童和年轻人在以色列占领的戈兰高地丧生的火箭弹攻击负责。 真主党确认舒克尔在贝鲁特的突袭行动中丧命，但他们否认发动了在戈兰高地的攻击。 无论如何，中东再次充斥着自去年10月7日以来，即将到来的全面战争的恐怖猜测。而且，残酷且讽刺的一点在于双方都不希望爆发这场战争，但却越来越准备冒险。 以色列一直受到美国盟友的压力，要求他们对真主党的报复保持克制，并在不引发毁灭性报复和引发更大规模战争的情况下去打击真主党。 但这两次暗杀行动等同于一次巨大的赌博。 压力下，以色列希望对真主党造成打击但不引发毁灭性报复。但真主党领导人哈桑·纳斯鲁拉仍可能作出这样的决定：因为以色列对他们在贝鲁特南部的大本营发动攻击，真主党就应该对特拉维夫进行同样力度的回击。 以色列可能也已经评估过，在伊朗境内及层层保护下杀害了这名巴勒斯坦领导人，德黑兰也不会对其宣战。 哈尼亚刚会见了伊朗新任总统就丢了性命，这无疑是以色列战力的一次戏剧性展示。 伊朗伊斯兰共和国称，在今年4月对以色列发射数百枚导弹和无人机后已重建了抵御敌军的战力，但这一说法现已被证实是空洞的。当时发动的炮击是报复以色列之前空袭了位于大马士革的伊朗大使馆并杀害了2名伊朗将军。 现在看来伊朗、其盟友黎巴嫩真主党或其代理人很可能会再次进行报复。亲伊朗的伊拉克民兵已明确表示，针对暗杀事件，他们也指责并要求华盛顿负责。在红海地区，也许也会看到胡塞武装分子从也门（叶门）加大对以色列的攻击。 因为数月来来在加沙地带遭受以色列猛攻，哈马斯反击能力有限。而以色列对在其占领的西岸或在国内遭受攻击的可能性都有高度警惕。 众人必须认知到，中东地区已陷入了一场区域性战争，而且情况可能会变得更加糟。在这个世界上最动荡地区，战争的风险即严峻又清晰可见，我们很容易想像并构建各种战争情景。但即便如此，这一轮杀戮和报复也未必会引发全面战争。 一次又一次化解，无法减少全面战争的可能性。这也使得建立一条远离全面冲突威胁的外交途径变得更加困难。 如何降低中东致命高温？唯一有效的第一步就是加沙停火。",

    "description": "艾奥内·威尔斯（Ione Wells）&amp; 凡妮莎·布施施吕特（Vanessa Buschschlüter） BBC记者 发自加拉加斯和伦敦 11 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 在南美国家委内瑞拉总统选举的争议“结果揭晓”后，首都加拉加斯街头爆发了新一轮的示威。 数千人聚集在委内瑞拉首都市中心，抗议现任总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicolas Maduro）宣称拿下胜利。 许多人认为，他们不会停止抗议，直到出现新政府。有些人还说，只有当国家安全部队加入反对派示威，新政府才会出现。 但是该国军队和警察到目前为止仍然忠诚于马杜罗，并开始对一些抗议者发射催泪瓦斯和橡胶子弹。 委内瑞拉地方官员称约有750人被逮捕。该国两家主要的非政府组织表示，至今已有数名民众死亡，数十人受伤。 周二（7月30日），委内瑞拉国防部长将抗议活动称为是一场“政变”。 被武装部队的保护下，弗拉基米尔·帕德里诺（Vladimir Padrino）将军宣读了一份声明称，马杜罗总统拥有军队的“绝对忠诚和无条件的支持。” 此外，马杜罗的亲密盟友、委内瑞拉检察长说，在反政府抗议活动中一名士兵已被杀害。 委内瑞拉：中俄印六大国选边站队各有考量 委内瑞拉危机：伊朗油轮与美国军舰或在海上对峙 中国向委内瑞拉再伸援手 习近平马杜罗各有所图 委内瑞拉危机：七张图帮你梳理头绪 图像来源， Getty Images 示威者向BBC强调他们发现大选舞弊证。 反对派领袖玛丽亚·科琳娜·马查多（Maria Corina Machado）呼吁抗议活动保持和平。她说：“我们必须以和平的方式行事。我们不应陷入政府设下的挑衅陷阱。他们想让委内瑞拉人彼此对抗。” “我们的候选人赢得了70%的选票。我们团结了一个国家，曾经相信马杜罗的委内瑞拉人今天过来与我们站在一起了。” 害怕遭到安全部队报复而不愿具名的一名示威者向BBC强调，他们发现了大选舞弊证据。 他说：“我们绝对确定选举被偷走了。我在投票站工作。政府不承认这一点，他们在半夜停止了所有投票计票。他们不想让世界知道他们输了。” 示威者又解释，过去支持前领导人查韦斯（Hugo Chavez）的委内瑞拉公民，即所谓的“查维斯主义者”（Chavistas）现正在收回对现任总统马杜罗的支持。 “这是一个非常和平的抗议活动。这是加拉加斯的富人区。但我们昨天看到的情况相当暴力。我相信以前是查维斯主义者的人现在已不再是了。”示威者说。 “我认为人们都希望有所改变。情况很可能会演变成暴力冲突。” 图像来源， Reuters 反对派领袖玛丽亚·科琳娜·马查多呼吁和平示威。 抗议活动在该国全国选举委员会（CNE）主席宣布马杜罗“成功连任”第三届总统任期后爆发。这位主席是马杜罗所属政党的成员，也曾是后者的法律顾问。 委内瑞拉全国选举委员会此前宣布马杜罗以51%的得票率当选，领先于反对派埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯 （Edmundo González）的44%。 但委内瑞拉选举机构至今未公布详细的投票统计数据。因此，反对派认为大选结果存在舞弊。 美洲国家组织（OAS）指责委内瑞拉政府完全扭曲了选举结果。支持贡萨雷斯的反对派联盟说，他们已经审查了73.2%的投票统计数据，坚持认为贡萨雷斯以很大优势胜出。 图像来源， Reuters 这些年来，近780万人逃离了在马杜罗政权下饱受经济和政治危机的母国 “我们有记录显示我们的胜利是绝对的，在数学上是无可逆转的胜利。”贡萨雷斯对外强调。然而本周委内瑞拉全国选举委员会仍宣称所有票数均已统计完毕，结果是现任总统胜出。 此外，长期支持马杜罗的检察长塔雷克·萨布（Tarek Saab）警告称，被捕者将被指控“颠覆政府”，并且在最严重的情况下将会涉嫌“恐怖主义”。 委内瑞拉反对党“人民意志”（Popular Will）强调，现在被拘留的包括该党的全国政治协调员佛莱迪·苏帕拉诺（Freddy Superlano）。 该党又警告称，执政党政府正加强力度镇压要求政府公布投票数据的人士。 图像来源， Reuters 马杜罗的支持者也走上街头，坚称他赢得了公平的胜利。 住在佩特雷市（Patera）的朱利奥·德比斯（Julio Derbis）向BBC强调：“我们将战斗下去。我们希望通过街头压力能够推翻总统想要继续掌权的企图。” “警察是我们的邻居。我们生活在一起，他们需要明白需要加入争取所有人共同利益的战斗。” 另一名示威者卡里娜·平托（Karina Pinto）向BBC解释此次抗议与之前的反政府示威不同。 她说：“我们必须走上街头，因为这是唯一的方式。我们不支持暴力，但政府很暴力。我们必须作出回应。 “安全部队必须站在我们这一边，他们也是委内瑞拉人。他们不能反对我们，因为我们跟她们一样都是人民。” 不过在该市内另一个区域，马杜罗总统的支持者也聚集在街头，坚称他公平获胜。 跳过 YouTube 帖子, 1 允许Google YouTube内容 此文包含Google YouTube提供的内容。由于这些内容会使用曲奇或小甜饼等科技，我们在加载任何内容前会寻求您的认可。 您可能在给与许可前愿意阅读Google YouTube 小甜饼政策 和 隐私政策 。 希望阅读上述内容，请点击“接受并继续”。 Accept and continue 告知：第三方内容可能包含广告 结尾 YouTube 帖子, 1 无内容 继续浏览 YouTube BBC对外部网站内容不负责任。 一名支持者南希·拉蒙斯（Nancy Ramones）说：“我没有在抗议任何事情，我在支持我的政府，就是那个获胜的政府。尼古拉斯·马杜罗总统。我支持他，因为他是代表和平的人。” “反对派说的那些都没有证据。如果他们说选举存在舞弊就必须证明。事实上没有发生任何舞弊。反对派总是有一些隐藏的政治目的。” “这是我们不会允许的政变，因为我们是爱国者。我们是委内瑞拉人，我们热爱和平。”拉蒙斯说。 另一位民众米拉格罗斯·亚罗查（Milagros Arocha）向BBC强调：“在这里，真正获胜的是尼古拉斯·马杜罗。这里是代表尼古拉斯·马杜罗的人。我们要和平。” 在普遍的不满情绪中，委内瑞拉反对党已经团结一致支持贡萨雷斯参选，试图在马杜罗执政11年之后推翻他的政府。 这些年来，近780万人逃离了在马杜罗政权下饱受经济和政治危机困扰的委内瑞拉。 联合国人权事务高级专员沃可·特尔克（Volker Turk）表示，他对委内瑞拉日益紧张和暴力的局势深感担忧。他呼吁当局尊重所有委内瑞拉人和平集会和抗议的权利。",

    "description": "彼得·鲍尔（Peter Ball）和劳拉·加西亚（Laura Garcia） BBC国际部记者，巴黎报道 14 分钟前 桥下走道上摆放着棱角分明的尖顶混凝土块。 2024年奥运会的目标不仅是一场体育盛会，也是主办城市巴黎的可持续发展和复兴。但该计划受到活动人士的质疑，他们声称当局一直在强迫脆弱的移民和无家可归者离开街道，并将他们驱散到法国各地。 在巴黎一座横跨运河的桥下，坐落着数十个巨大而棱角分明的尖顶混凝土块。 活动人士表示，这些石块的用途是在2024年奥运会期间，让流浪者和移民远离街头。 法律倡导组织“巴黎团结协会”（Paris Solidarity Bar）的奥莱丽亚·胡特（Aurelia Huot）说：“今天，街上再也没有人了。” “你可以看到桥下的这些石块。”她指着一片片混凝土块补充道。“警察会来巡逻，以免移民们回来重新搭建营地。” 巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？ 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 巴黎奥运2024：奖牌榜上哪个国家或地区领先？ 奥莱丽亚·胡特（Aurelia Huot）为法律倡导组织“巴黎团结协会”工作。 大约在奥运会开幕式前一周，一群流浪者从这里搬走。这是奥运会开幕前几个月当局清理的一长串据点和营地中最新的一处。 法雷斯·阿尔卡利·优素福（Faris Al Khali Youssouf）就是受影响者之一。他是一名来自乍得的移民，他和其他大约500人住在离奥运村只有几百米远的一栋建筑里，该建筑曾经属于一家混凝土工厂。 今年4月，防暴警察对这栋楼进行了清场，居民们被告知，他们将被安排在巴黎地区或数百公里外的图卢兹市暂住。 “你不得不说，这对难民来说简直就是一场噩梦。”法雷斯说。 “这是我们所有同胞目前都在经历的事情——他们在购买地铁票时被拦下，被截住并被转移到拘留中心。” 你的器材不支持播放多媒体材料 巴黎被指为奥运清理流浪者：“这对难民来说是一场噩梦” “难民正面临压力。” 从部署混凝土块的地方沿着运河步行几分钟后，活动人士保罗·阿劳兹（Paul Alauzy）在不同的桥下描述了另一次清场的过程。 “这里曾经有好几年都是帐篷城，有三年都有人在这里。”他指着人们曾经扎营的柱子之间的缝隙说。“到处都是帐篷，有时有100、200或300人。” 保罗为“奖牌的另一面”（Le Revers de la Médaille）组织工作。他称，在奥运会筹备期间，约有1.3万名移民离开了巴黎街头。 这是一项长期战略的一部分，活动人士认为，随着奥运会的临近，这项战略正在加速推进。 优素福表示，他在非洲国家乍得受到政治迫害后逃亡到法国。 当局已经为迁离街头的人们提供了住所，但这些住所往往是临时性的，而且远离巴黎，分布在法国各地的不同城市。 “当你把巴黎街头的人们送到很远的小城市时，他们就没有了同样的团结网络。”保罗说。 “当然，我们不希望人们呆在外面，我们希望他们有地方住。”他补充说。 “但如果你像这样驱散，而不提供长期的解决方案，你将永远无法解决问题。” 图像来源， Getty Images 巴黎警察清理了优素福曾经居住过的占屋区。 他说，在巴黎为移民群体开发的大型社区之外，人们很难获得所需的支持和医疗服务，最终只能搬回首都，重新流落街头。 在之前的奥运会上也有类似的抱怨。在东京，流浪者群体抱怨说，他们被迫离开曾经露宿的公园；在里约热内卢，整个贫民窟棚户区都被清空了。 然而，巴黎当局坚持认为，让人们离开街头是改善他们生活的关键。 图像来源， Getty Images 在奥运会筹备期间，巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）表示：“我也希望能解决为流浪者提供住房的问题”。 在奥运会筹备期间，巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）表示：“我也希望——这也是我们正在与国家讨论的议题之一——能解决为流浪者提供住房的问题”。 “据我所知，在现阶段，阻碍事情发展的是国家可以分配的财政资源。” 巴黎市政厅对BBC表示，“流浪者问题是奥运筹备工作的核心，在奥运会期间，巴黎市政厅将继续保持警惕，为弱势人群提供住宿。” 该部门还补充说：“巴黎市政府不会运用对流浪者有敌意的城市设施”。 该部门说，放置在桥下的混凝土块并不在巴黎市的土地上，而是属于邻近的卫星城欧贝维利耶（Aubervilliers）。欧贝维利耶市政当局表示，其正在使用“劝阻性”的街道设施，以防止“移民和吸毒者”回流。 活动人士保罗·阿劳齐讲述桥下移民营地如何被当局清理掉。 不过，许多活动人士仍对此深表担忧。 “对我来说，简而言之，这就是一场社会清理。”保罗说。 “你把人们赶出去，防止他们再回来，你只是把苦痛藏在地毯下，因为这只是短期的解决方案。”",

    "description": "25 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 本周一，习近平与梅洛尼在北京钓鱼台国宾馆举行了会谈。 7月27日至31日，意大利总理乔治亚·梅洛尼（Giorgia Meloni）对中国进行正式访问，访问期间，她会见了中国权力排名最高的三个领导人：国家主席习近平、总理李强、人大委员长赵乐际。 在会见习近平时她表示，中国是应对全球紧张局势的“重要对话者”；会见李强后，签署了一项加强经济合作的三年行动计划。 梅洛尼是意大利右翼政治家，2022年执政后退出习近平的标志性对外政策“一带一路”倡议，此前意大利是唯一加入该倡议的G7国家。 2022年11月，梅洛尼与习近平在巴厘岛G20峰会期间进行了双边会谈；此次是她上任后首次访华。梅洛尼称，此行为了“重启”意大利与中国的关系。 做了什么，说了什么 梅洛尼带着自己8岁的女儿抵达北京开启访华行程。 上周日她与中国国务院总理李强会面，梅洛尼表示，“我很高兴来这里展开本届政府的首次正式访问，在此之前，我们已经举行了数次高级别会议，这表明了我们开启新阶段的意愿，在我们全球战略伙伴关系建立20周年之际，重新启动我们的双边合作。” 会谈后，在梅洛尼和李强的见证下，中意两国签署三年行动计划，梅洛尼称其为“尝试新的合作形式”。 北京方面声明称，此举旨在增加两国在中小型企业在造船、航空航天、新能源、人工智能等领域的互利合作。 周日晚些时候，梅洛尼和李强出席了中意商业论坛，并在论坛上宣布了六项新协议，涉及电动汽车和可再生能源等不同领域。 梅洛尼在论坛上说，意大利与中国签署了一份工业合作备忘录，涉及电动汽车和可再生能源领域，这些是“中国已经运作了一段时间的前沿技术行业……（中国）正与合作伙伴分享新的前沿知识”。 一带一路：G7唯一参与国意大利正式退出 意大利大选极右翼政党获胜 有望诞生首位女总理 “一带一路”倡议十周年 改变世界的成败与未来 图像来源， Getty Image 两国领导人会谈。 本周一，梅洛尼在北京钓鱼台国宾馆与习近平会谈，她表示，“国际上不安全因素日益增多，我认为中国不可避免地成为应对所有这些情况的一个非常重要的对话者。 她说，两国必须 “共同思考”，以保持稳定和保障和平。 意大利总理办公室其后发布声明称，两国领导人讨论的问题包括乌克兰战争、中东局势进一步升级的风险以及印度洋-太平洋地区日益加剧的紧张局势，以及“从人工智能到应对气候变化和联合国安理会改革”等一些最重要的全球治理问题。 习近平则敦促罗马和北京“秉持丝绸之路精神”，使东西方关系“重回新时代”。 他说，“双方都面临着共同发展的重要机遇”，并补充说，“北京欢迎意大利企业来华投资，也愿意进口更多高质量的意大利产品”。 意大利通讯社（ANSA）报道称，习近平还表示中国有意与意大利探索在电动汽车和人工智能等新兴领域的合作。意大利是中国在欧盟的第四大贸易伙伴，该国因此仍热衷于寻求与北京建立强有力的经济关系。 在梅洛尼访问期间，两国还共同纪念意大利探险家马可·波罗逝世700周年。 值得一提的是，梅洛尼还在上述商业论坛上说：“中国在意大利的投资约为意大利在中国投资的三分之一。我希望以正确的方式缩小这一差距”。除了投资外，贸易也不平衡，去年双边贸易额达717.58亿美元，其中主要是中国对意大利的出口。 尴尬的前奏 梅洛尼访华过程中，中意双方在公开讲话和声明中，绝口不提“一带一路”倡议。只有习近平在会谈时表示，“中国和意大利分处古丝绸之路两端”，“弘扬丝路精神”，但未直接谈及中国雄心勃勃的“一带一路”倡议。 2019年，意大利成为第一个签署“一带一路”倡议的七国集团国家，这引起了美国和其他欧洲国家的担忧，认为这可能导致中国控制关键技术和基础设施。 然而，彼时在野的梅洛尼长期以来一直对“一带一路”倡议持批评态度，梅洛尼称其为 “一个大错误”。2022年梅洛尼上台，2023年12月正式通知中国政府将于年底退出该倡议。 投资银行“那提西银行”（Natixis）亚太区首席经济学家阿莉西亚·加西亚·埃雷罗（Alicia Garcia-Herrero）向媒体表示，“每个加入（一带一路倡议）的国家都知道，中国是第一位的，而他们是第二位的，我不认为意大利作为七国集团（G7）成员希望与俄罗斯、巴基斯坦或斯里兰卡被归为一类。” 她补充说：“如果没有‘一带一路倡议’（成员资格），梅洛尼与中国的接触就会处于不同的层次——不再是附庸，而是合作伙伴。” 不过，当时许多意大利公司担心中国政府可能会采取报复行动，影响它们在中国的投资或者与中国的贸易。 不仅如此，梅洛尼上台后还阻止一家中国国有企业控制轮胎制造巨头倍耐力（Pirelli）。 图像来源， Getty Images 中国的国有化工巨头中化集团是倍耐力的最大股东，持有这家拥有151年历史的米兰公司37%的股份。 去年六月，倍耐力在一份致投资者的声明中对外表示，意大利政府已裁定，只有倍耐力老板马尔科·特隆切蒂·普罗维拉（Marco Tronchetti Provera）控制的卡姆芬公司（Camfin）才能提名首席执行官候选人。 倍耐力还表示，政府已决定，该公司针对公司治理的任何变化都应接受官方审查。 在最近中国和欧盟的贸易摩擦中，意大利也支持欧盟委员会提高对中国进口电动车关税的决策。 早在2008年，梅洛尼作为已故总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼（Silvio Berlusconi）政府的青年部长，她曾敦促意大利运动员抵制2008年北京奥运会开幕式，以抗议中国的人权记录，尤其是在西藏的人权问题。 外界认为，这些都成为与中国改善关系过程中的阻碍。 重启之路 但中国有可能不计前嫌，跟意大利修补关系——路透社表示，意大利对中国具有重要的战略意义，因为该国以前曾独自与中国进行过合作，并可能成为欧盟、G7等集团内部一个对华温和的声音。 曾倡导罗马在2019年加入“一带一路”倡议的意大利前政府官员米歇尔·杰拉奇（Michele Geraci）说，中国政府可能也会渴望摆脱最近的挫折。 “中国的目标是假装一切顺利，&quot;他说。“他们对强调意大利退出‘一带一路’倡议并无太大兴趣。他们不喜欢这样，不喜欢大惊小怪。” 图像来源， Getty Image 中意两国国旗 梅洛尼的公开发言似乎表明，意大利也有意向中国靠拢，并成为中国在欧盟中的朋友之一。梅洛尼称，“我认为，意大利也可以在（中国）与欧盟的关系中发挥重要作用，并在此尝试建立尽可能平衡的贸易关系。” 路透社表示，虽然意大利去年迫于美国压力最终退出“一带一路”，但罗马在周日签署了一项为期三年的行动计划，表明它仍希望与这个亚洲巨人建立更牢固的贸易关系。 中国国际问题研究院欧洲研究所所长崔洪建说，面对地缘政治的不确定性，包括美国大选带来的不确定性，中国的首要任务是稳定两国关系。中方告诉意方“我们需要在两国关系中增加一些韧性”。 但这并不意味着重启关系之路会一帆风顺。梅洛尼本人一直对中国持警惕态度，对中国的人权问题直言不讳，还指责中国的不公平贸易行为，并警告欧洲在战略供应链中过度依赖中国公司可能带来风险。 即便是气氛颇为友好的访华之旅期间，她在上述商业论坛上，对企业高管们说，“显然，我们不能掩盖严重失衡的问题，这对意大利来说是一个重要的逆差”，并提到了改善中国市场准入和加强知识产权保护的必要性。 李强在会面时也表示，“希望欧盟客观看待中国的发展......深化对话与合作”，“保护主义无法保护竞争力”。",

    "title": "巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/sports-69230112",
    "description": "詹姆斯·菲茨杰拉德（James FitzGerald） 巴黎报道 1 小时前 图像来源， EPA 这本该是2024年巴黎奥运会的一大亮点：铁人三项运动员在塞纳河中竞逐，让游泳回归巴黎市中心。但出于对水质的担忧，首场比赛不得不推迟一天进行。 我们来到原计划起点稍下游的荣军院桥（Pont des Invalides）上，当地人和游客向我谈起他们是否想亲自下水游泳。 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 “这是一条美丽的河流。”在七月的炎热日子里，巴黎人赫达（Reda）看着塞纳河波光粼粼的水面说道。 “但我永远不会潜入水中，即便他们清理了很多年。” 塞纳河已经在本届奥运会中成为主角。在上周五晚淅淅沥沥的雨中举行的开幕式上，塞纳河接待了数以千计参加游船巡游的运动员。 一个世纪以来，由于水质问题，当局一直禁止市民在塞纳河中游泳。但通过一项大型改造项目，在塞纳河里畅游将成为本届奥运会的重要遗产之一。 就在本周一，组织者还表示他们有信心铁人三项比赛将按计划进行。但周末的大雨使这一计划落空。 巴黎的“单一系统”排水设施已经饱和，来自厨房、厕所和街道上的雨水等额外水源被排入河中。 巴黎人赫达说自己永远不会潜入塞纳河水中。 巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）最近在塞纳河中游泳，以强调为清洁塞纳河所做的努力。 此前的检测结果显示，塞纳河中的大肠杆菌水平超过了体育协会规定的上限。这种细菌可导致呕吐和腹泻等疾病。 BBC记者休·肖菲尔德（Hugh Schofield）当时也加入了伊达尔戈的行列。他不小心吞下一口河水，但他说水的味道还不错。 我在荣军院桥上与许多游客交谈时，他们都说在本国露天水域游泳并非难事。 来自英国、德国、荷兰和捷克的游客都表示，他们曾在本国的河流、湖泊和运河中游泳，如果有证据表明塞纳河是安全的，他们也会这么做。 埃斯米（右）表示，这条河看上去“没有那么糟糕”。 “我愿意试试。”来自荷兰的女士埃斯米（Esmee）说，“从这里看并没有那么糟糕。” 法国在优质浴场水质方面落后于欧盟平均水平。根据欧洲环境署（European Environment Agency）的数据，2023年约有75%的法国浴场水质被评为优，而整个欧盟的这一比例为85%。 该机构在今年5月发布的报告中指出，虽然在欧盟的大多数浴场游泳都是安全的，但沿海水域的游泳条件普遍优于河流和湖泊。 塞浦路斯以97.6%的浴场水质优良率位居榜首，其次是奥地利的96.9%和克罗地亚的96.7%。 由于该数据只针对欧盟国家，因此不包括英国。尽管塞纳河已开始允许游泳，但目前英国只有泰晤士河的一个河段——牛津郡瓦灵福德附近——被指定为游泳场所。 欧洲环境署特别提到了巴黎10年前开始的耗资14亿欧元（11亿英镑；15 亿美元）的清理行动。 作为这项行动的一部分，巴黎建造了一个巨大的雨水蓄集池。它可以储存相当于20个奥林匹克游泳池的水量。这是阻止污水在暴雨期间流入塞纳河的机制的一部分。 丹妮勒表示，她期待着在这条著名的河流中畅游。 在男子铁人三项比赛前夕，并非所有来到大桥的游客都对清洁问题感到困扰。一些人表示，只要天气足够暖和，无论如何他们都会考虑跳进河里。 一位来自巴西的男子说，他和他的同胞就是这么做的。他承认：“在我的城市圣保罗，河水也不干净。” 但许多巴黎人都认为，一条干净、适于游泳的河流将成为奥运遗产中令人兴奋的一部分。 大学教授丹妮勒（Danielle）说，她“绝对会”在塞纳河中游泳。 “我早就想这么做了。”她笑着说。 对于一个名叫达米安（Damien）的男子来说，保持塞纳河的清洁是一项“大工程”，但值得一做。 “这对所有巴黎人来说都是一个好机会。”他说。 目前，塞纳河的水质每天都会被进行检测。 2024年巴黎奥运会运营总监兰比斯·康斯坦丁尼蒂斯（Lambis Konstantinidis）说，目前有若干备用计划，包括使用补赛日。 他在星期一对BBC说，只有在“非常、非常极端的情况下”，才会考虑将铁人三项赛降级为铁人二项，并完全取消游泳比赛。 劳伦·特纳（Lauren Turner）补充报道",

    "description": "In today’s newsletter: With elbows up on both sides, two very different political operators – Mark Carney and the Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre – attempt to fend off threats from the south Good morning. When Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning as Canada’s prime minister in January, he did so amid surging support for the Conservative opposition and a sense that its Trump-adjacent leader, Pierre Poilievre, might be the right candidate for a new political era. The Liberals’ near-decade in power appeared to be close to an end. Now, Trudeau’s successor, the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, has called a snap general election against a dramatically different political backdrop. With Donald Trump’s tariff war and musings about Canada’s future as a 51st state the inescapable mood music, many voters who had given up on the Liberals appear ready to give them another hearing – and Poilievre is trying to distance himself from the president whose methods he was once so happy to adopt. Trump administration | A catastrophic security leak triggered outrage in US politics after senior Trump administration officials accidentally broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along. The stunning breach implicates key figures in the Trump administration including the vice-president, JD Vance. Domestic violence | Domestic abusers are driving their victims to suicide , police have warned, as they admitted to past mistakes and pledged to investigate more “hidden” cases of violence against women. The concession came as deaths by suicide among victims of domestic abuse surpassed the number of people killed by an intimate partner for a second year in a row. UK economy | Rachel Reeves will put £2bn into affordable housing in a bid to “sweeten the pill” of the spending cuts being announced at this week’s spring statement. The chancellor will set out one of the tightest budget buffers on record, with the Office for Budget Responsibility expected to put the government about £5bn in the red. Turkey | Turkish authorities have arrested more than 1,100 people including journalists , while bombarding the social media platform X with requests to block hundreds of accounts after tens of thousands took to the streets in the largest anti-government demonstrations in years. Archaeology | One of the biggest and most important iron age hoards ever found in the UK has been revealed, potentially altering our understanding of life in Britain 2,000 years ago. More than 800 objects were unearthed in a field near the village of Melsonby, North Yorkshire dating back to the first century. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Researchers say findings ‘challenge myth’ about monogamy while also showing no significant gap in sexual satisfaction Non-monogamous people are just as happy in their love lives as those with only one partner but are not “significantly” more sexually satisfied than traditional couples, research suggests. Polyamory, open relationships and swinging are among the many forms of consensual non-monogamy. Polyamory has become increasingly mainstream, with a recent poll showing that one in 25 Britons have experienced it. A further one in 14 said they would be open to exploring it. Continue reading...",

The findings, from the UK’s fertility watchdog, mean that about 40,000 people a year wanting to conceive are spending money on acupuncture, supplements and drugs, even though they are largely unproven. Some patients are facing increasingly long waits for care, of up to two years, especially for NHS fertility treatment. 51% of patients who used donor sperm got it from abroad, where rules on the maximum number of families that can be created by one donor are looser than in the UK. While 73% of patients are satisfied with their fertility treatment, Asian and black patients are less likely to be satisfied. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The Amazon Spring Sale has arrived, bringing a slew of discounts on household essentials, fashion, outdoor gear and even furniture. We at Engadget are focused on tech, and while the selection this time around isn’t quite as good as that of Amazon Prime Day in July, there are some decent discounts to be had. Some of our favorite robot vacuums, air purifiers, headphones and storage gear are on sale right now for some of the best prices we’ve seen this year so far. Below, you’ll find all of the best tech deals we could find in the Amazon Spring Sale.

Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge.

Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off): A version of one of our favorite air fryers , this air fryer toaster oven has 11 cooking modes including air fry, broil, bake, roast and more, and it has a large capacity that can fit up to six slices of bread at once or a 13-inch pizza. The Pro model is also on sale, down to $320 from $400. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $20 (43 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget streaming device can play content at 1080p/60fps and now its remote can also control your TV&#39;s power and volume. There&#39;s also Alexa support built into the remote, so you can use voice commands to search for content. Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $169 ($80 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you&#39;re on the market for a new desktop, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Blink Mini 2 for $20 (50 percent off): Blink&#39;s latest wired, indoor security camera is one of our favorites , particularly if you&#39;re just starting out building a security camera system. It&#39;s easy to set up and use, and it works seamlessly with Amazon&#39;s Alexa. Plus, if you want a local storage option, you can buy the Blink Sync Module 2 and a thumb drive to store video clips locally. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 ($30 off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. Levoit Core 400S air purifier for $187 ($33 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier for most people, the Core 400S has easy-to-use onboard controls, powerful filtering technology that isn&#39;t too loud and relatively affordable replacement filters. It reliably improved air quality in our testing, and even though its mobile app is a little overstuffed, it gives you another way to control and monitor the device. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "description": "Gaming journalism stalwart Game Informer has risen from the ashes. More than thirty years after its debut issue back in August 1991, the media outlet was officially shut down by parent company GameStop in August 2024. Since then, the rights to Game Informer were acquired by Gunzilla Games and, in an all-to-rare win for today&#39;s media world, the entire team that worked for Game Informer at the time of its closure will return to their jobs. Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller posted the details about how the outlet was saved from the brink and noted that Gunzilla Games will be a hands-off boss. &quot;The new owners insisted on the idea of Game Informer remaining an independent editorial outlet,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They felt just as strongly as our team did that the only path forward was with an editorial group that made 100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so, without any influence from them or anyone else.&quot; “We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry,&quot; Gunzilla CEO and Co-Founder Vlad Korolov said . The website and its back catalog of content have been republished online. Game Informer &#39;s staff have also published reviews of more than two dozen games that came out during the site&#39;s hiatus and belatedly compiled their requisite best games of 2024 list. The print magazine is also expected to resume activity, and Miller said more details will be forthcoming about subscription and membership options. Gunzilla Games, which counts Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp among its leadership, made a battle royale shooter called Off the Grid and also developed the GUNZ blockchain platform.

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale tech deals under $50: The best sales on our favorite budget gear",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-tech-deals-under-50-the-best-sales-on-our-favorite-budget-gear-091512204.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon kicked off its latest Big Spring Sale today, and though the week-long event mostly focuses on things like apparel and outdoor goods, it still includes a few notable discounts on electronics. We have a big roundup with the best of those , but if you’re on a tighter budget, below we’ve dug up a few decent tech deals that are available for less than $50. Generally speaking, this sale doesn&#39;t emphasize tech nearly as much as Black Friday or Prime Day, but the offers below bring several accessories we recommend near their all-time lows. As a reminder, the event runs through March 31, and you don’t need to be an Amazon Prime member to see most of the price drops. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals under $50 Anker PowerConf C200 for $48 ($12 off MSRP) : The PowerConf C200 is our favorite webcam for those on a tighter budget due to its crisp video quality, easy setup, solid microphones and built-in privacy cover. Its USB cable is on the shorter side, and it can’t match the overall accuracy of our top pick, but it’s still a clear upgrade over a built-in laptop camera for a much lower price. This is another deal we’ve seen numerous times in the last year, but it’s as low as the camera usually goes. Anker 525 Charging Station for $30 ($36 off) : We recommend this reliable desktop charging station in our remote worker gift guide . It can’t provide the absolute fastest charge to your smartphone or laptop (topping out at a quick enough 67W), but it packs four USB ports — two USB-C, two USB-A — and three AC outlets in a frame that’s small enough to fit on a crowded desk. This deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen. The Anker 525 Charging Station. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anker Nano Charger 30W for $13 ($10 off) : It’s hard to have too many portable wall chargers on standby. This one from Anker should be particularly useful for traveling: At just over an inch thick, it’s small enough to fit in a pocket, while its 30W USB-C port is enough to top up recent iPhones at full speed. (That’s not enough for some newer Android phones , though.) This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Amazon Music Unlimited 3-month trial for free ($24 off) : Amazon is offering new subscribers three months of its Music Unlimited streaming service for free. Normally, it gives new users a one-month trial. Though Music Unlimited isn’t a top pick in our guide to the best music services , it still gets you lossless streaming quality and an extensive library of both music and podcasts. You could do worse if you just want to bum a few months of music streaming for no cost. Just note that your subscription will auto-renew once the trial period ends until you cancel. The Blink Mini 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Blink Mini 2 for $20 ($20 off) : This deal ties the lowest price to date for the Blink Mini 2, which is the budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras . This one comes with its share of trade-offs for the low price — its image quality isn’t the best, it locks certain features behind a paywall and it won’t automatically arm when you leave the house — but it still provides functional 1080p video, color night vision, motion alerts and Alexa support in a weather-resistant frame. It’s fairly simple to set up, too, though you’ll need to buy an external module if you want to store clips locally. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Unlike the AirTag, it can also attach directly to a keychain. It probably isn’t the safest choice for long-distance travel, but it’s a convenient security blanket if you, say, leave your keys or wallet behind at a restaurant. This is another discount that’s been available for a few weeks, but it’s just 10 cents more the best price we’ve seen.

    "title": "The Pentagon warns government officials that Signal is being targeted by Russian hackers",

    "description": "As it turns out, including a reporter in your national security leader group chat about military strikes isn&#39;t the only way to compromise sensitive information on Signal. NPR reported on Tuesday that, days after the Trump administration&#39;s preposterous and dangerous national security fumble , the Pentagon issued a warning against using the messaging app due to a phishing vulnerability. &quot;A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger application,&quot; a department-wide email obtained by NPR reads. &quot;Russian professional hacking groups are employing [Signal&#39;s] &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations.&quot; The publication says the memo states that Russian hacking groups are &quot;targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.&quot; A Signal spokesperson told NPR that the memo wasn&#39;t about Signal&#39;s security but about phishing attacks on the platform. So, if you&#39;re using the app, be especially mindful of attempts to trick you into linking devices to your account. Or simply communicate through different channels. The Pentagon directive follows a scandal that, at least in previous eras, would have ended the careers of a long list of high-profile officials. (In this one… who knows?) The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that a group of Trump administration national security officials inadvertently included him in a Signal group chat discussing military strikes in Yemen. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images The conversation included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, among others. They — with Goldberg essentially CC&#39;d — discussed the timing, targets and weapons involved in bombing Houthi sites in Yemen. A 2023 Department of Defense memo prohibited using mobile apps for even &quot;controlled unclassified information.&quot; NPR notes that military planning is many degrees more sensitive than that. And that doesn&#39;t even cover accidentally including a journalist in the conversation. The entire Atlantic article is worth a read, but a few gems from the chat include Hegseth&#39;s writing, &quot;I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It&#39;s PATHETIC.&quot; And, &quot;Nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.&quot; Adding to the &quot;It would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so dangerous&quot; nature of the fiasco, Hegseth went on camera to deny the chat&#39;s authenticity after the White House confirmed it. Although the fallout is still taking shape, here&#39;s an early taste. Watch below as retired US Navy captain and current US Senator Mark Kelly grills Gabbard and Ratcliffe on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals: Save up to $200 on AirPods, iPads and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-apple-deals-save-up-to-200-on-airpods-ipads-and-more-092050968.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon has rolled out another sitewide sales event . The Big Spring Sale, as this one is called, is focused on apparel and outdoor goods more than electronics, but we’ve cut through the noise and found a few tech deals anyway. If you’re looking for a new Apple device specifically, good news: A handful of AirPods, iPads and Apple Watches are at or near their lowest prices to date. Many of those discounts aren’t explicitly tied to the sale, but if you just want to save a little cash, that shouldn’t matter much. We’ve rounded up the best Spring Sale Apple deals we could find below. As a refresher, Amazon says the event will run through March 31, and none of the deals below are exclusive to Prime members. Best Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $150 ($29 off MSRP) : This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple’s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn’t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a score of 86 in our review. This discount is $11 higher than the best price we’ve seen, but it’s about as low as the earbuds have fallen outside of that. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. The Apple Watch Series 10. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off) : The top pick in our guide to the best smartwatches , the Series 10 is a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer profile and a marginally larger display compared to the previous Series 9. That said, it remains a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. It should be a welcome upgrade if you’re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch (think pre-Series 7) — just keep in mind a patent dispute has locked it out the blood oxygen detection features found on those older models. This $100 discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the non-cellular model with a 42mm case. Apple iPad (A16) for $329 ($20 off) : The newest entry-level iPad only arrived three weeks ago, but Amazon is currently selling it for $20 less than Apple direct, which is a decent little savings if you planned on grabbing the tablet early anyway. This one is another small update, but it now comes with a faster A16 chip, more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. Our review is coming soon, but TL;DR: If you only need an iPad for media consumption and lighter work, it’s still a fine value. Apple iPad Air 11-inch (M3) for $549 ($50 off) : Much like the deal on the base iPad above, this isn’t a huge discount, but it’s a nice chance to save a few bucks compared to buying from Apple directly. The new iPad Air was released on the same day as the iPad (A16) and is a similarly minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still prefer the Air over the base model if you can swing it: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. The older M2-powered model is an even better value if you can find it on sale, but either way the Air is the iPad we recommend to most people. The 13-inch iPad Air M3. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $738 ($61 off) : We gave the 13-inch iPad Air a review score of 89 earlier this month. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 128GB model. Apple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off) : The iPad Pro is more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being how expensive it all is. This deal on doesn’t truly lessen that — and it’s another deal we’ve seen multiple times in recent months — but it still ties the 13-inch model’s all-time low.

    "title": "The best Amazon Spring Sale deals on kitchen tech including discounts on gear from Breville, KitchenAid, Ninja and more",

    "description": "We’ve reviewed plenty of cooking gear — and the best of those gadgets are rarely cheap. There’s nothing like a good sale to take the sting out of outfitting your kitchen with new appliances and Amazon’s Big Spring Sale happens to have a lot of kitchen tech on sale right now. We’ve combed through the many, many pages of what’s discounted and found what’s worthy of checking out. Right now, a lot of the kitchen tech we’ve tried and recommend is seeing sizable discounts. So if you’ve been pondering an Instant Pot, sous vide machine or an air fryer , now is a good time to grab something new. The best Amazon Spring Sale deals on air fryers, Instant Pots and more Cosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off) : Cosori’s fryer earned a spot as the runner up for best overall air fryer in our guide. It has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity. We like that it doesn’t take up too much space, but can still cook up a decent amount of food Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off) : If you want a more traditional toaster oven design with a huge capacity, go for our premium air fryer pick. The fryer-and-oven combo can accommodate a five-quart dutch oven, so it’s almost an auxiliary oven, which could come in handy when you’re cooking for a crowd. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it went for $300 at the end of last year. Breville the Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off) : This is the non-Pro version of the Breville air fryer we recommend . It has a slightly smaller capacity (0.8 cubic feet instead of one cubic foot) and is missing two cooking functions (dehydrate and proof). But if you’re not making your own jerky or baking a ton of bread, this one can toast, broil, air fry and slow cook. You can even get it in cool colors like Red Velvet Cake for the same price. Mannkitchen Pepper Cannon for $160 ($40 off) : Our reviewer called this grinder one of his favorite kitchen gadgets . While he admits it’s a rather indulgent purchase, it does rather impressively crank out far more pepper per turn than other mills, and the grind coarseness is highly adjustable to perfectly pepper your food. Ninja DZ401 Foodi 10-quart air fryer for $190 ($40 off) : If you need to air fry two different foods at once, go for our recommendation for a dual-zone air fryer. It’s a beast, so we think it’s best for larger kitchens and people who make big meals. It went as low as $130 for Black Friday last year, but this is the cheapest price we’ve seen since then. Instant Vortex 2QT Mini Air Fryer for $50 ($10 off) : The budget pick in our guide doesn’t go on sale often — it’s already pretty cheap at its $60 list price. It’s sold for as little as $48 for Prime Day in July, but this is the cheapest we’ve seen since then. Its two-quart capacity is probably best for small kitchens and can crisp up food for one or two people. Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $90 $40 off) : We like this Instant Pot model because it&#39;s simple to use and has several quick-cooking modes including beans, cake, sous vide and more. It went as low as $70 earlier this year, but this is still a 30 percent discount off the list price. Instant Pot Pro Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $125 ($75 off) : We also suggest this fancier Pro Plus model in our guide to kitchen tech . It’s a Wi-Fi connected unit with a canning function and you can even release the steam remotely using the companion app — which has over 800 recipes. This matches the lowest price we saw earlier this year, but is still a bit more than its $99 all-time low. Ninja AF150AMZ Air Fryer for $120 (25 percent off) : This went as low as $100 for the holidays last year, but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen since then. The fryer gets an honorable mention in our air fryer guide because it makes good use of limited counter space with its taller design. The round cooking basket doesn’t feel as roomy as square ones but it does have a dehydrate option that other cookers don’t come with. Anova Culinary Sous Vide 3.0 for $129 ($70 off) : We named this the best overall sous vide machine after testing a number of models for our buyer’s guide. This is about $30 more than the low it hit for the holidays last year, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. We appreciate the easy digital controls and found that the high flow rate maintains water temperature better than other machines. Plus, if you’re at a loss for what to cook, you can check out the companion app which is replete with recipes. Cosori Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $60 ($10 off) : This kettle earned a spot in our list of favorite small kitchen appliances. It has different built-in temperature settings for different types of drinks and an elegant gooseneck pour. This is a price it has hit many times before, but is a chance to save $10 over the usual MSRP. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $165 ($30 off) : This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. This is the pro model of the version we recommend in our tea guide . KitchenAid Artisan 5-quart stand mixer for $380 ($80 off) : Small wonder that the home cook’s gold standard of mixers made its way onto our kitchen tech guide . Its ton of available attachments can be used to make pasta, grind food, strain or spiralize fruits and veggies and more. This is no unitasker. This is a solid $80 discount off of the MSRP, but we’ll note that Amazon sold it for as low as $330 at the end of last year and for $350 last month. KitchenAid Go Cordless Hand Blender for $100 ($30 off) : The big selling point here is the removable battery that you can use for other KitchenAid Go appliances. In our testing, it had enough power to turn a roasted butternut squash into a smooth, creamy soup. The blender has hit this price a few times over the past few months and the deal isn’t as good as the $77 it sold for at the end of last year. Cosori Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $60 ($10 off) : This kettle earned a spot in our list of favorite small kitchen appliances. It has different built-in temperature settings for different types of drinks and an elegant gooseneck pour. This is a price it has hit many times before, but is a chance to save $10 over the usual MSRP.

    "description": "We hear Signal is in the news . As longtime fans of the app, and secure messaging more broadly, we feel like it&#39;s our duty at Engadget to ensure you know how to use the software properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download Signal Signal is available on Android and iOS , as well as nearly every desktop operating system, including Windows and macOS. You can download the app by clicking one of the links provided above, or typing in &quot;Signal Messenger&quot; in your device&#39;s app store. Once you&#39;ve installed the app, proceed to set up an account using your phone number or an alias.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: If you want to install Signal on a workplace phone or computer, be sure to obtain approval from your employer; some organizations, such as the US government, either actively discourage or downright disallow use of the app.&nbsp; Create a new group Wonderful, you&#39;ve downloaded Signal! Now, to create a group chat, follow these steps:&nbsp; Tap the compose icon at the top of the interface.&nbsp; Select New Group. Add participants by selecting their name from your contact list, or inputting their username or phone number.&nbsp; Give your group a name (and a profile picture if you want).&nbsp; If the contents are especially sensitive, you may wish to enable Disappearing Messages and select an expiration time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#39;re in the process of adding new participants to a group, be sure to verify you&#39;re adding the right people. &nbsp; Some useful tips I would also suggest making use of Signal&#39;s Permissions feature to limit who can invite people to your chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings.&nbsp; Scroll down and select Permissions. Under &quot;Add Members,&quot; tap Only Admins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways someone can join your group chat is through a group link or QR Code . For additional security, you can set it so that admins must approve group link invites before the invitee can join.&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Scroll down and select Group Link.&nbsp; Switch the toggle to on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you know exactly who you can trust, but the guy down the hall might not! If you tend to get mixed up on names easily, Signal allows you to assign nicknames to users. After all, no one wants a case of mistaken identity. Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to assign a nickname to.&nbsp; Type in a name. You can also add a note, say describing the person&#39;s profession, in case you need additional context.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicknames are only visible to you, so don&#39;t be embarrassed to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp; How to remove someone from your group chat Look, even the best of us can make mistakes. Thankfully, Signal makes it easy to remove someone from a conversation thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to remove.&nbsp; Tap Remove From Group.&nbsp; How to delete messages in a Signal group chat So you somehow got through all of the above steps, added someone you shouldn&#39;t have and sent information that a relative stranger likely shouldn&#39;t have seen. Lets be honest, you&#39;re an edge case. But there&#39;s still hope if you caught your mistakes early.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap and hold the message on mobile (or hover the message bubble on desktop), Select Delete. Select Delete for Everyone. Now there&#39;s less chance of, for instance, a record of your civil and perhaps even criminal mishaps being shared to a notable reporter in a form potentially open to legal discovery.&nbsp; Ultimately, no matter how secure the messaging platform, if what you need to talk about is very, very sensitive, it&#39;s probably best to just &quot; get everyone in a room together .&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-add-someone-to-a-signal-group-chat-201430756.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is only in its second year and, so far, we’ve found it to focus less on tech deals and more on home, cleaning and fashion discounts. That perhaps makes sense considering its timing, spring is a time for renewal and a refresh after all. But luckily, tech and home cleaning neatly intersect in the category of robot vacuums. We’ve tested dozens of these handy automatic floor cleaners and put the results in our buying guides . Right now, a number of our picks and related models are on sale so we’ve rounded up the best deals on vacuums Amazon’s latest sale has to offer. The best Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac for $400 ($350 off) : In our testing, we’ve been consistently impressed with Shark vacuums — but they’re not cheap. This machine can mop in addition to vacuum and is nearly half price at 47 percent off. Shark Robot PowerDetect NeverTouch vac and mop combo for $500 ($400 off) : This is the non-pro model of our runner up pick for the best combo bot. It mops and vacuums, quickly making a map of your home on its first run. The app easily lets you program where your hard and carpeted surfaces are, as well as set schedules. The base empties the dry debris and dirty water, then refills it with new water. The difference between this model and the Pro version is that this one doesn’t clean the mop with each use, so you may need to manually perform that task more often — but the price difference may make up for that lack. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off) : This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX for $140 (44 percent off) : The “S” in the model name stands for “slim” and it was one of the more low-profile machines we tried. It’s a pick in our guide to budget robot vacuums and has a long battery life and good suction power for its price. The main drawback is the lack of Wi-Fi, so instead of programming it with your phone, you’ll use the included remote. The best cordless vacuum deals Tineco Pure ONE Station 5 for $349 ($110 off) : This vac earned an honorable mention in our tests. The self-emptying base is a big selling point. We also liked the auto-adjusting suction and single-button start feature. The fact that it doesn’t require proprietary bags helps keep down the long-term cost, too. &nbsp; Tineco Pure ONE S11 cordless vacuum for $205 ($95 off with coupon) : Click the coupon to get $95 off our top pick for a budget stick vac. We like that it automatically adjusts suction depending on what it&#39;s picking up and is relatively lightweight when you’re pushing it around your floors. The bin is on the small side and the battery life isn’t as good as on other models, but it’s an easy-to-use, no-frills way to clean floors. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off) : This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Tineco Pure ONE Station FurFree for $400 ($300 off) : Of all the stick vacs our reviewer tried for our guide , this is the one she wanted to use the most. It’s super convenient with a dock that charges and empties and cleans all parts of the machine — brush, tube and dustbin — after each use. Plus the suction power is great and the iLoop smart sensor kicks up the suction when needed.

    "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed again. Publisher Paradox Interactive announced today that it is now targeting release in October 2025 instead of the first half of this year. &quot;Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date,&quot; the company said. Creating the sequel has been a trial of endurance that would test even an immortal undead&#39;s patience. Paradox parted ways with the game&#39;s original developer, Hardsuit Labs, in 2021. The Chinese Room, which made notable indie games Dear Esther and Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture , joined the project as developer in 2023. Today&#39;s update from offered some encouragement that the project is now in &quot;a late development stage,&quot; however it has decided to discontinue dev diaries that offered behind-the-scenes peeks at progress. The original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines game came out in 2004 after its own challenging development. Made by the now-shuttered Troika Studios, it was an story-driven game inspired by a tabletop RPG about several vampire clans in a modern-day Los Angeles. It was a commercial flop, but acquired a loyal audience over the years and even cultivated a community for mods and fan games .

    "description": "If you live in a rural area of the UK, you may soon be able to use your phone for satellite calls, messages and other standard data use. On Tuesday, the nation&#39;s telecom regulator, Ofcom, proposed using direct-to-device satellite tech to connect people in the UK&#39;s &quot;most rural and hard-to-reach places,&quot; like mountains and remote villages. Ofcom sees the tech complementing traditional networks, aiming to provide 100 percent mobile coverage in the UK. The regulator said the tech could also provide backup coverage during outages, offer service to ships and passengers in coastal waters without a connection and provide emergency 999 services (the UK&#39;s version of 911) in remote areas. In January, British telecom Vodafone made the world&#39;s first satellite video call using a standard mobile phone on a remote mountain in west Wales. Regarding the regulatory details, Ofcom suggests amending existing mobile spectrum licenses for frequencies already used by cellular providers (below 3 GHz). However, the regulator also offered alternative approaches, including introducing a new license for satellite services or allowing license-exempt use if certain conditions are met. Regardless of its specific policy approach, Ofcom said strict conditions would be attached to avoid interference with existing spectrum users in the UK and overseas. Ofcom is opening a consultation period with stakeholders from now to May 20. Depending on the feedback it receives, it could begin authorizing direct-to-device calls later this year.&nbsp; The iPhone 14 series was the first standard handset to offer direct-to-satellite emergency messaging . In iOS 18, Apple expanded the functionality beyond crises to any situation where you&#39;re off the grid . The Samsung Galaxy S25 series and Google Pixel 9 recently added similar functionality .

    "description": "Sunderfolk , a game that borrows elements from tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and couch party games like Jackbox, has a launch date. The fantasy RPG from Dreamhaven (the stomping ground of Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime ) arrives on April 23. You can play a demo today through April 7. While virtual tabletops like Wizards of the Coast&#39;s Sigil act as video game-like extensions of a traditional tabletop experience, Sunderfolk &#39;s premise is in using modern technology to simulate something like D&amp;D — but with more accessibility to casual players. Here, your phone becomes the deck of cards (and controller), while your TV or monitor is the game board. Although it supports remote play, this one sounds tailor-made for couch co-op. The game&#39;s story retreads familiar fantasy tropes, like a town of peaceful inhabitants invaded by dark and creepy monsters. Here, the heroes are a clan of anthropomorphic animals who each fit a familiar class like arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger or rogue. You can customize each with weapons, armor, items and skills as they level up. (When in doubt, play the classics!) Dreamhaven &quot;We were, with Sunderfolk, really trying to create something that would inspire people to get together in person,&quot; Game Director Erin Marek said in a preview trailer. &quot;We wanted it to feel similar to a game night, getting together to play a board game or getting together to play D&amp;D with a group of friends or family or loved ones that you really care about. And to share that experience together side-by-side.&quot; You can gather your cohorts to try the game for free on GeForce Now from now to April 7. The preview gives you access to all playable characters and an early part of the game. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need a paid GeForce membership ; a free account will do. Sunderfolk will cost $50 and be playable Steam , PS5 , Xbox Series X and Switch. But only the party member running the big-screen device needs to own the game; the phone app (iOS and Android) for your pals will be a free download when the game launches on April 23.

    "description": "Google has the pedal to the metal on its AI development. Just a few months after the debut of Gemini 2.0 , the tech giant has unveiled another upgrade in Gemini 2.5 . As with any new AI launch, Google is touting a strong performance on LMArena for Gemini 2.5, particularly its capabilities in coding, mathematics and science. The first model in this series is Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Google said this is a thinking model that&#39;s intended to provide responses grounded in more reasoning, analysis and context than the answers offered by classification- and prediction-driven models. It&#39;s a different approach than Google took with the Gemini 2.0 series, which started off with the more efficient and less expensive Flash version. &quot;With Gemini 2.5, we&#39;ve achieved a new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training,&quot; the company said in a blog post attributed to Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO of Google DeepMind. &quot;Going forward, we’re building these thinking capabilities directly into all of our models, so they can handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.&quot; Google had only just started rolling out Gemini 2.0 to its services, using it to power the newly added AI Mode in search and Deep Research for handling more complex queries. With today&#39;s launch, expect to hear more updates from the company about getting this latest version. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is available now in Google AI Studio, and Gemini Advanced members can use it directly in the Gemini app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-releases-gemini-25-ai-model-for-complex-thinking-182352224.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI just announced that all users will soon be able to generate images directly inside of ChatGPT. It’s rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team and, most importantly, Free users. This will be the default image generation tool in 4o, so there will be no need to open Dall-E whenever you want to whip up a picture of a cat in space eating lasagna or whatever. The feature’s also coming to Sora. The company says that the platform will &quot;generate high-quality images based on your prompt, conversation and uploaded files.&quot; To the latter point, it’ll be able to transform pre-existing images based on prompts. OpenAI is also boasting about significant improvements in text rendering and contextual understanding. These new tools are intended for both personal and professional use. As such, OpenAI gives a number of examples as to where this type of image generation could come in handy. These include the creation of infographics, social media promotional graphics and images with plenty of text, as seen below.&nbsp; OpenAI This being a modern generation tool, it can also handle high-end visuals. The company says it offers a &quot;strong capability for photorealism, including light, shadow, and texture accuracy.&quot; The ability to understand context could also be useful, as OpenAI says this could be used to create a “poster of birds found in Central Park” or a &quot;visualization of an art history era discussed previously in the conversation.&quot; Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqN Text and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx — OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 13, 2024 It&#39;s built on GPT-4o, an AI model that was first released last year . The &quot;o&quot; stands for &quot;omni&quot;, which is a reference to the model’s multimodal capabilities. This is what allows many of the aforementioned features, like being able to iterate on uploaded files. Today’s news looks like another step on the long road toward the “one AI to rule them all” functionality that Sam Altman teased a few weeks back .

    "description": "Apple announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference will be on June 9-13. The company is usually consistent with its event timing, so Tim Cook will probably take the stage to start the keynote on June 9 at 10AM PT/1PM ET. We&#39;ve already heard that iOS 19 and macOS 16 will be sporting new looks , so expect a focus on the latest software changes. And there&#39;s no way we won&#39;t be getting more Apple Intelligence updates. It was a core part of the iOS 18.3 update that rolled out at the start of the year and Apple has had struggles with some of the AI-powered features, particularly its notification summaries . One thing we don&#39;t anticipate seeing is the long-awaited update to Siri that will offer more personalization, also courtesy of Apple Intelligence. That project hit a delay in March and, no matter how hard we might hope otherwise , it seems unlikely the issues will all be resolved by June. Although the keynote is happening in-person at Apple Park, the rest of WWDC will take place online and is free for developers to attend.

    "description": "It&#39;s your lucky day if you&#39;re looking for good deals on Apple devices . Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , the Apple Watch Series 10 has dropped to its lowest price to date. The smartwatch is back on sale for a record-low price of $299. That&#39;s a $100 discount. The Apple Watch SE got a discount too. The device typically retails for $249, but you can snap it up for $169 . The Apple Watch Series 10 is our pick for the best smartwatch overall . That may not necessarily apply if you&#39;re an Android user, since you need an iPhone to actually use an Apple Watch. In any case, we gave the Apple Watch Series 10 a score of 90 in our review . Apple&#39;s current flagship smartwatch has a bigger screen, making it easier to see your notifications and health data (it&#39;s a pretty dang great device for wellness and fitness tracking). The thinner frame makes it more aesthetically pleasing too. On the downside, losing the blood oxygen feature from previous models is a bummer, but that issue was out of Apple&#39;s hands to a certain extent . It&#39;s perhaps not quite worth an upgrade if you have a Series 8 or 9 already. Apple isn&#39;t exactly reinventing the wheel here. Plus the sleep apnea detection feature that debuted alongside the Series 10 is also available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Still, if you&#39;re an Apple Watch newcomer or upgrading from an even older model, the Series 10 is likely your best option, especially for the sake of future proofing.

    "description": "Waymo is continuing to expand its foothold across the US, having recently started offering paid robotaxi services in more parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. Next up are Atlanta and Miami , and now the company has revealed plans to offer its driverless Waymo One service in the nation&#39;s capital in 2026. Before that can happen, though, Waymo will need to get approval from regulators. The company says it will &quot;continue to work closely with policymakers to formalize the regulations needed to operate without a human behind the wheel in the District.&quot; DC currently requires autonomous vehicles to have a human at the wheel, ready to take control if necessary. “Our priority remains ensuring that any company operating in the District — such as Waymo — does so in a manner that prioritizes safety, aligns with our regulatory framework, and integrates seamlessly into DC’s unique transportation ecosystem,” German Vigil, a spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, told The Washington Post . He noted that the agency is refining its approach to regulation &quot;based on public input, emerging best practices and lessons learned” from other jurisdictions. Waymo has tested its vehicles in DC for several years and it plans to &quot;continue introducing ourselves to DC’s communities and emergency responders over the coming months.&quot; Per the Post , if and when Waymo One does become available in the District, the robotaxis would not take riders to any of the region&#39;s airports, as they wouldn&#39;t (at least at the outset) have a permit to cross into Maryland or Virginia.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-has-a-new-program-for-school-officials-to-report-bullying-160027748.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Instagram is adding another tool to its arsenal of anti-bullying measures. This time, however, Meta is enlisting school officials directly in an effort to speed up its response to safety issues affecting young teens. The company is introducing a new “Schools Partnership Program” that aims to give teachers and school administrators a way to intervene when students experience bullying on Instagram. The program offers schools something that many parents have long said they wanted: a way to fast-track in-app reports that directly affect young students. Meta is promising that schools who join the program will have their reports “prioritized” in its moderation queue, and that it will respond to these reports within 48 hours. Schools that sign up will also get a “school partner” badge appended to their Instagram account, along with in-app information about how to use its reporting tools and other resources. Notably though, it doesn’t sound like Meta is hiring additional content moderators to aid with these new fast-tracked reports. When asked about increasing headcount to support the program, an Instagram spokesperson told Engadget only that reports from schools will be “expedited” via its existing reporting channels, and that schools will be able to add &quot;additional context&quot; to their reports. Meta says it’s already tested the program with 60 schools and that early results have been “promising.” Now, middle schools and high schools in the United States can sign up to join a waitlist for the program. The pilot program is far from the first time Instagram has tried to address bullying. The app introduced comment limiting features in 2021 , and added a tougher &quot; restrict &quot; feature last year. But while these features can help teens avoid certain types of negative interactions, they still required teens (or their parents) to tweak their settings. By now giving schools more authority to report specific instances of bullying or other bad behavior, Meta is offering some hope that it will be easier for schools to address the underlying behavior.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-overhauls-its-budget-earbuds-while-keeping-the-price-the-same-010025194.html?src=rss",
    "description": "When Sony&#39;s wireless earbuds come to mind, the flagship-quality WF-1000XM5 is probably the first product that jumps out. However, the company is also adept at building budget models, blending features and tech to give users a solid value for a lot less money. That was the proposition when the WF-C700N arrived in 2023 , offering active noise cancellation (ANC), solid battery life and other features for $120. Now, Sony is back with the successor to those earbuds, the WF-C710N , that packs a host of improvements but keeps the price the same.&nbsp; First, Sony says it improved ANC performance by employing dual mics on each earbud on the C710N. The C700N only had one on each side. The company is also using AI Noise Reduction this time around to improve call quality. On the outside, Sony replaced the physical button for the onboard controls with a touch panel, and the company added wear detection for added convenience.&nbsp; You can also expect longer battery life on the C710N. At 8.5 hours with ANC enabled, that&#39;s an hour longer than the C700N. With ANC off, you can expect up to two hours more than the previous model. Additionally, total battery life including the case is doubled, with up to 30 hours of noise-canceling use available (up to 40 hours with ANC off). Sony improved the quick charge feature as well, giving you an hour of play time in five minutes instead of the previous 10-minute window. The WF-C710N is available for preorder today in black, white, pink and a transparent Glass Blue for $120. I guess Sony&#39;s confusing product names aren&#39;t entirely going away after all.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-overhauls-its-budget-earbuds-while-keeping-the-price-the-same-010025194.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Discord has begun rolling out a redesigned desktop app that adds more customization to the client. To start, the new app increases the number of free themes to four. Where previously you could choose between two skins — light and dark — if you weren&#39;t a Nitro subscriber, now your options are light, ash, dark and onyx. In short, everyone gets access to more dark themes. Discord has also added three new UI density options — default, spacious and compact. These are separate from the app&#39;s existing message layout options, so it&#39;s another way to tweak the look and feel of the interface. With this redesign, the company is also finally giving users the option to resize the channel list. Discord has also redesigned the controls that appear when you&#39;re on a voice or video call. Now, more of the buttons you may want to press during a call will appear in the center bar along the bottom of the screen. At the same time, the mic and camera buttons feature more color, so you have a better indicator if you&#39;re muted or your camera is active. &quot;All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,&quot; Discord explains. Discord Separately, the redesigned app ships with a new overlay that Discord says is faster and won&#39;t impact game performance. Taking a page Valve&#39;s recent redesign of Steam , Discord has reworked the interface around widgets, meaning you can move around each individual element as you wish. The company has also re-engineered the overlay so that it doesn&#39;t &quot;hook&quot; itself into games. As a result, it&#39;s less likely to trigger anti-cheat systems like BattleEye . In turn, that means the new overlay is compatible with &quot;a larger portion of the most-played games on Discord.&quot; It&#39;s even possible to watch a friend&#39;s stream directly from the new overlay. The redesigned app and overlay arrive after Discord CEO Jason Citron announced last May the company would refocus on building the best possible communications tool for gamers. In 2020, Discord briefly rebranded itself as a general purpose chat app after many young people turned to the platform to stay in touch with their friends during lockdown. &quot;After taking stock of the world now that the pandemic is largely behind us, and learning directly from you about how Discord can be even more useful, we&#39;ve recognized the need to narrow our focus from broadly being a community-centric chat app to being a place that helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests,&quot; Citron wrote last year. The update also arrives at what could be a pivotal moment for Discord. According to a recent New York Times report , the company could go public as early as later this year. With 72 percent of Discord users regularly gaming on PC, ensuring those people are taken care of ahead of a potential IPO takes on a sense of urgency.

    "description": "The once-iconic music-sharing platform Napster just sold for $207 million, according to reporting by CNBC . A company called Infinite Reality ponied up the cash. What could Napster offer in 2025 to warrant such a price tag? Infinite Reality CEO John Acunto says it’ll be used for marketing in the metaverse. In other words, a platform from 1999 will be used as part of a technology that seemingly peaked in 2021. That sounds about right. More specifically, the company plans on creating virtual 3D spaces for music fans to attend concerts and listening parties, in addition to creating a sales platform for musicians and labels to sell merch. This isn’t the worst idea in the world, as attending these kinds of shared events is probably my favorite aspect of VR. &quot;The most legendary collab?! Infinite Reality has acquired iconic online music brand @Napster . With this acquisition, we&#39;re expanding and reimagining Napster, empowering artists with new audience monetization and engagement capabilities, underpinned by iR’s #immersive … pic.twitter.com/L4Fig7QFct — Infinite Reality (@Infinite_iR) March 25, 2025 “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” Acunto said. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.” Napster holds numerous licenses to stream millions of songs, which is what made it an attractive prospect to Infinite Reality. The company says its version of Napster will “disrupt legally.” Current Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos says that the purchase will allow artists to create “crazy environments that are really only limited by their imaginations.” As an example, he described a reggae artist who might enjoy a virtual beach environment. Acunto adds that it’ll be like “Clubhouse times a trillion.” He’s referring to the virtual events app that became popular during COVID , but eventually petered out. Infinite Reality has been on a buying spree the last couple of years. In addition to Napster, it purchased the Drone Racing League , the metaverse marketing platform Landvault and the VR shopping platform Obsess . As for Napster, it started in 1999 and took the world by storm, creating an easy-peasy way to steal music. It only took a couple of years for mounting legal battles to catch up to the platform and it declared bankruptcy in 2001. However, that was just the beginning . The software company Roxio purchased the platform in 2002 and relaunched it as a legitimate e-commerce venture that sold digital music files. In 2008, Best Buy came calling and scooped it up. The retail giant only held on to Napster for a few years before selling to Rhapsody in 2011 . Rhapsody tried to make Napster a household name in Europe for the next decade before a consortium of blockchain companies, led by Hivemind and Algorand, bought it in 2022 . These companies had plans to do some kind of NFT-based nonsense, because “music x web3 is one of the most exciting spaces.” That didn’t work and, well, here we are. Here’s to another 25 years of being passed around like a hot potato.

    "description": "It&#39;s no secret that Dyson devices are pricey, but you can find good sales on them if you&#39;re patient and know where to look. Case in point, the Amazon Spring Sale : not only are a few Dyson cordless vacuums included amongst the discounts, but this Dyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus heater and fan is as well. You can snag it for $300, or $170 off its usual price. As its name suggests, the Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus can heat your room in the winter and cool it off in the summer. Its fan mode includes Air Multiplier tech, which creates a smooth and uninterrupted airstream thanks to its lack of traditional fan blades. When you need some warmth, its ceramic plates heat up quickly. The appliance has two modes: focused and diffused. Focused mode warms or cools one person, while diffused mode heats your entire room or provides a gentle breeze during the summer. It oscillates at a 70-degree angle. Dyson&#39;s fan has a sleep timer with a shutoff range between 15 minutes and nine hours, and you can store its curved and magnetized remote control inside the appliance to help prevent it from being lost. The lowest we&#39;ve ever seen this product&#39;s price drop is $280, so being able to snag it for $300 in the middle of March, when we&#39;re nowhere near Black Friday or Prime Day, is about as good a deal as you can hope for. If you&#39;re on the market for other Dyson gear , a few more devices are included in the Amazon Spring Sale, including the Dyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum on discount for $330.

    "description": "Apple plans to start using images it collects for Maps to train its AI models. In a disclosure spotted by 9to5Mac , the company said starting this month it would use images it captures to provide its Look Around feature for the additional purpose of training some of its generative AI models. Look Around is Apple&#39;s answer to Google Street View. The company originally released the feature alongside its 2019 revamp of Apple Maps . The tool allows users to see locations from ground level. Apple blurs faces and license plates photographed in Look Around images to protect the privacy of any individuals caught in its survey efforts. &quot;In addition to improving Apple Maps and the algorithms that blur faces and license plates in images published in Look Around feature, Apple also will use blurred imagery collected during surveys conducted beginning in March 2025 to develop and improve other Apple products and services,&quot; the company writes in the disclosure. &quot;This includes using data to train models powering Apple products and services, including models related to image recognition, creation, and enhancement.&quot; Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget&#39;s request for more information. The company&#39;s Apple Maps image collection policy page provides a list of regions and dates when it plans to collect new images for Look Around. People can find when Apple&#39;s survey crews and vehicles plan to visit their area by sorting by country and then clicking on a specific region. Apple currently offers a few different features that rely on image generation models. Image Playground, for instance, allows owners of Apple Intelligence -compatible devices to write a prompt to create a new image. There&#39;s also Clean Up in Photos, which you can use to remove objects from your favorite snapshots. Google has been using Street View images to train AI models for years. In 2017, for example, a pair of researchers from the company trained a machine learning model to generate professional-looking photographs from a dataset collected from Street View.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-will-use-its-street-view-maps-photos-to-train-ai-models-150919972.html?src=rss",

A whole bunch of colorways are on sale here, including white, black, pink, green and purple. Anker products are all over our list of the best power banks and portable chargers , so this device is in good company. The 321 MagGo is, as the name suggests, a magnetic power bank that snaps onto the back of smartphones. It works with cases, so long as the case is magnetic. Inside, there’s a 5,000mAh battery that provides up to 19 hours of additional use for modern iPhones. It’s equipped with heat sensors that continuously monitor temperatures to avoid accidental damage and it can juice up a phone while it’s being charged itself. This power bank is also on the smaller side, so it easily fits into pockets, bags and purses. The only downside is that this is only for Prime members. However, the Anker Nano 3-in-1 portable charger is on sale for everyone. This non-magnetic charger includes a large 10,000mAh battery and is currently $35 . Even some of Anker&#39;s latest power banks and chargers that it debuted at CES have discounts as part of the Spring Sale as well.

    "description": "Apple may avoid a fine in one of the European Union investigations it&#39;s currently the subject of. The bloc&#39;s executive arm, the European Commission, will next week end a probe into whether Apple hindered iPhone users from easily changing their browser or search engine, according to Reuters . Apple is said to have complied with rules laid out under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to make it a cinch for users to switch to alternative browsers, social media platforms and other online services while giving smaller rivals a better chance to compete. Violations of the DMA, legislation that broadly seeks to keep the power of Big Tech in check, can lead to a fine of up to 10 percent of a company&#39;s total annual revenue, and up to 20 percent for repeat offenses. However, Apple may not be entirely off the hook. Per the report, the EU is set to dish out fines to both that company and Meta. The second Apple case concerns whether the company inhibited app developers from freely informing users about alternate payment options that are available away from the App Store ecosystem. As for Meta, it was reported this week that the EU may fine the company north of $1 billion for violating DMA rules as a result of its &quot;consent or pay&quot; ad-free subscription option in the region.

    "description": "Now that the Amazon Spring Sale is here, we&#39;re on the lookout for the best tech deals to grab from it. In typical Amazon fashion, Blink security cameras have been discounted for the shopping event. The Blink Mini 2 is available for $20 , which is half off its regular price and the best discount we&#39;ve seen. You can pick up two of the wired security cameras for $38, which represents a 46 percent discount. We reckon the Blink Mini 2 is the best budget security camera around. You can adjust the webcam-style camera to a variety of angles. It&#39;s weather-resistant, so you can place it outside if you have a special power adapter. The camera picks up decent (but not great) images, particularly those captured in the infrared nighttime view. It also has a built-in LED spotlight. Since Blink is an Amazon company, of course the Mini 2 ties into the Alexa ecosystem. You&#39;ll just need to have a Blink account before you can actually use it. As you might expect, you&#39;ll be able to view images captured by the Mini 2 via the Alexa app on an Echo Show, Fire Tablet or Fire TV but, curiously, not iOS or Android. To see the captures on your phone or tablet, you&#39;ll instead need to use the Blink app. You&#39;ll get some extra features — such as cloud storage and people and pet detection — if you sign up for the Blink Subscription ($3 per month for one camera, $10 per month for any number). Elsewhere in the sale, a five-pack of the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras is half off at $200 . This is our recommendation for the best security camera for Alexa users . Having five of them should be enough for many folks to keep an eye on everything that&#39;s going on around their property.

    "description": "Starting today, DJs will have access to Apple Music&#39;s catalog of over 100 million songs through more hardware and software platforms. DJs of all skill levels can build and mix sets on AlphaTheta, Serato, Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark and RANE DJ. This news follows the initial debut of Apple Music integration with Algoriddim&#39;s djay Pro software last year. There&#39;s also a new name for the whole initiative: DJ with Apple Music . And yes, a subscription is required. This isn&#39;t to be confused with Apple Music&#39;s DJ Mixes, a separate program that began in 2021 . The idea there was to attract creators of said DJ mixes and sets to the platform by leveraging Shazam&#39;s technology (owned by Apple) to ensure proper royalties were paid out. Now, Apple says, it&#39;s giving DJs access to its music catalog so it can be used as a creative tool and so they can easily tap into their personal libraries. There&#39;s a new DJ with Apple Music category page in the streaming app with curated playlists, and each platform has its own curator page complete with practice material. Spotify used to allow integration with third-party DJ apps, but the service stopped doing so in 2020 . If you&#39;re looking for options, djay Pro works with Tidal and SoundCloud, in addition to Apple Music.

    "description": "The Amazon Spring Sale has made me jealous — I&#39;m envious of those who can now pick up Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM5 headphones at a record-low price, as someone who paid full price for them long ago. Our top picks for the best wireless headphones you can buy are on sale for $250, which represents a 38 percent discount and the best price we&#39;ve seen. The sale is available on the Silver and Smoky Pink models. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones are one of them. I&#39;ve raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they&#39;re so comfortable. I&#39;ve worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp; Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they&#39;re a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don&#39;t have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp; Their excellence on flights isn&#39;t the only reason we gave Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones a 95 in our review . They&#39;re also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound&#39;s quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don&#39;t fold up, but especially at this price, they&#39;re still such a great buy.&nbsp; This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don&#39;t quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

    "description": "Anker&#39;s Eufy 3-in-1 E20 robot vacuum is $150 off right now , as part of Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. That brings the price down to $400, which is a record low. For those averse to using Amazon, the deal is also available directly from the company . The E20 made our list of the best robot vacuums , and with good reason. We loved the hybrid functionality, as this robovac quickly transforms into a cordless stick vacuum and a handheld unit. This in no way impedes the overall performance, as we found the automatic cleaning mode to be top-tier. The self-emptying base also holds a lot, considering its compact size. We praised the proprietary app in our official review , as editing room maps is both quick and easy. All told, it only took the robovac ten minutes to scoot around the house and create an accurate map.&nbsp; The suction power of the robotic unit is strong enough for major cleaning tasks, but the same cannot be said of the stick vacuum attachment. The power is on the weaker side. Also, it doesn’t come with a wall mount for the stick vacuum. That costs extra, to the tune of around $30. Today’s savings more than makes up for that.

    "description": "If you can&#39;t open a window for whatever reason, an air purifier can help make the air in your home a bit more comfortable. One of our favorites, the Levoit Core 400S air purifier , is on sale for $187 thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . While that&#39;s not a record low — we&#39;ve seen it as low as $177 last year — it&#39;s still a good discount on one of the most convenient air purifiers for large spaces. This deal is part of a larger Levoit sale during the Spring Sale that includes other air purifiers, humidifiers and more. We’ve featured Levoit in our list of the best air purifiers for its strong performance and smart features. The Core 400S can cover rooms up to 1,980 square feet using a three-stage filtration system to capture allergens, dust, pet dander and smoke. It also includes a smart sensor that adjusts fan speed based on air quality, so you’re not running it at full blast when you don’t need to. One of the Levoit Core 400S’ biggest selling points is its low noise output, which makes it a good fit for bedrooms or home offices. If you need to knuckle down and get some work done without distraction whilst keeping your room’s air clean and fresh, even at higher speeds, it stays relatively quiet compared to bulkier purifiers. It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands. Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness. If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.

That included Anker&#39;s Laptop Power Bank , a 25,000mAh portable charger with triple 100W USB-C ports and one USB port. Well, currently, that charger is on sale for $88, down from $110 — a 20 percent discount — as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale .&nbsp; The new power bank , available in Black and Silver, comes with two USB-C cables and can charge four devices simultaneously. It works with laptops, smartphones, cameras, gaming consoles and more. For example, it can charge an MacBook Air with an M3 chip to 50 percent in 33 minutes. It can also get an iPhone 16 to the same level in just 25 minutes. Plus, its display shows the battery&#39;s health and temperature, along with output and input wattage.&nbsp; Anker&#39;s 140W four-port wall charger is also discounted for Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale. You can pick it up right now for $77, down from $90. It offers a display that tracks power usage for each port, fast-charge status and temperature.

    "description": "If you’re looking for a budget-friendly robot vacuum that can handle both vacuuming and mopping, iRobot’s Roomba Combo Essential just hit its lowest price ever. Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , it’s down to $149 from $275, matching the lowest price we’ve seen. It previously dipped to $149 during the holiday season and earlier this year, but it’s unclear how long this deal will stick around this time. As you can see in our roundup of the best budget robot vacuums , we’ve consistently rated iRobot’s machines highly for their reliability and ease of use. The Roomba Combo Essential is a simple, no-frills option that both vacuums and mops, making it a solid pick for small apartments, dorm rooms or anyone who wants a cleaner floor without spending a fortune. The vacuum uses special multi-surface brushes to pick up dirt, dust and pet hair from hard floors and carpets. Unlike some budget models that struggle with transitions, this one automatically adjusts to different surfaces, so you won’t have to worry about it getting stuck. When it’s time to mop, the built-in mopping pad wipes down hard floors, tackling light spills and everyday messes. It’s not as advanced as iRobot’s higher-end models with precision scrubbing, but it’s a convenient way to keep your floors looking fresh with minimal effort. One of iRobot Roomba Combo Essential&#39;s most convenient features is its auto-adjusting cleaning power — the robot increases suction when it detects extra debris, so it’s more effective on high-traffic areas like entryways or around pet bowls. It also has cliff sensors to prevent it from tumbling down stairs and a low-profile design that helps it slip under some couches and other furniture for a more thorough clean. Despite it being an entry-level robot vacuum, the iRobot Roomba Combo Essential comes with app control and voice assistant support, so you can set cleaning schedules and initiate cleaning whether you’re at home lounging on the couch or away on vacation. For $150, this is a solid deal for an iRobot machine that can vacuum and mop, especially considering its usual $275 price tag. If you’ve been thinking about automating some of your floor cleaning, this is one of the most affordable ways to do it.

    "title": "The best vlogging cameras for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-vlogging-camera-151603452.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’re a content creator or YouTuber, Sony, Canon and other camera companies want your business. There are more vlogging-specific models than ever, with several new models having arrived since our last guide, including Fujifilm’s XM-5. Recent vlogging-specific models include Sony’s new ZV-E1 full-frame mirrorless that launched last year, DJI’s Osmo Pocket 3 and Canon’s compact PowerShot V10. Others in this guide, like the new Panasonic G9 II and Canon’s EOS R6 II are hybrid mirrorless cameras that offer vlogging as part of a larger toolset. Many have certain things in common, like flip-around screens, face- and/or eye-detect autofocus and stabilization. Prices, features and quality can vary widely, though. To that end, we’ve updated our guide with all the latest vlogging cameras designed for novice to professional creators, in all price ranges. Engadget has tested all of these to give you the best possible recommendations. Table of contents Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Upcoming cameras What to look for in a vlogging camera Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Best action and portable cameras If you’re just starting out in vlogging or need a small, rugged camera, an action cam might be your best bet. In general, they’re easy to use as you don’t have to worry about things like exposure or focus. Recent models also offer good electronic stabilization and sharp, colorful video at up to 4K and 60 fps. The downsides are a lack of control; image quality that’s not on par with larger cameras; and no zooming or option to change lenses. The best compact vlogging cameras Compact cameras are a step-up option from smartphones or action cameras, with larger sensors and much better image quality. At the same time, they’re not quite as versatile as mirrorless or DSLR cameras (and not necessarily cheaper) and they lack advanced options like 10-bit video. For folks who want the best possible quality without needing to think too much about their camera, however, it’s the best option. The best mirrorless vlogging cameras This is the class that has changed the most over the past couple of years, particularly in the more affordable price categories. Interchangeable lens cameras give you the most options for vlogging, offering larger sensors than compact cameras with better low-light sensitivity and shallower depth of field to isolate you or your subject. They also offer better control of your image with manual controls, log recording, 10-bit video and more. The drawbacks are extra weight compared to action or compact cameras, extra complexity and higher prices. Upcoming cameras If you’re not quite ready to buy, there are some interesting options on the horizon. Canon just teased a camera which could be the R50 V, likely to be a vlogging-focused update to the R50 I recommended. Canon may also announce the availability of the PowerShot V1, a compact camera with a Type 1.4 sensor that’s larger than the 1-inch sensors found on most compact cameras. Meanwhile, Panasonic just announced the S1R II, a 45-megapixel hybrid camera. Though the high resolution would suggest it’s mainly for photography, the S1R II can shoot 8K video at up to 30 fps and capture 5.7K 30 RAW internally. It’s fairly expensive, but considerably cheaper than other options including the Nikon Z8 and Canon EOS R5 II. That model is now on pre-order and set to start shipping by the end of March — stay tuned for Engadget’s review. What to look for in a vlogging camera Vlogging cameras are designed for filmmakers who often work alone and either use a tripod, gimbal, vehicle mount or just their hands to hold a camera. It has to be good not just for filming yourself, but other “B-roll” footage that helps tell your story. The number one requirement is a flip-around screen so you can see yourself while filming. Those can rotate up, down or to the side, but flipping out to the side is preferable so a tripod or microphone won’t block it. Continuous autofocus (AF) for video with face and eye detection is also a must. It becomes your camera “assistant,” keeping things in focus while you concentrate on your content. Most cameras can do that nowadays, but some still do it better than others. If you move around or walk a lot, you should look for a camera with built-in optical stabilization. Electronic stabilization is another option as long as you’re aware of the limitations. You’ll also need a camera with a fast sensor that limits rolling shutter, which can create a distracting jello “wobble” with quick camera movements. Steve Dent/Engadget 4K recording is another key feature. All cameras nowadays can shoot 4K up to at least 24 fps, but if possible, it’s better to have 4K at 60 or even 120 fps. If you shoot sports or other things involving fast movement, look for a model with at least 1080p at 120 fps for slow-motion recording. Video quality and color accuracy are other important considerations, especially for skin tones. Good light sensitivity helps for night shooting or concerts, and a log profile helps improve dynamic range in very bright or dark shooting conditions. If you want the best possible image quality and can afford it, get a camera that can record 4K with 10-bits (billions) of colors. That will give you more options when you go to edit. Don’t neglect audio either; if the quality is bad, your audience will disengage. Look for a camera with a microphone port so you can plug in a shotgun or lapel mic for interviews, or at least one with a good-quality built-in microphone. It’s also nice to have a headphone port to monitor sound so you can avoid nasty surprises after you’ve finished shooting. You’ll also want good battery life and, if possible, dual memory card slots for a backup. Finally, don’t forget about your camera’s size and weight. If you’re constantly carrying one while shooting, especially at the end of a gimbal or gorillapod, it might actually be the most important factor. That’s why tiny GoPro cameras are so popular for sports, despite offering lower image quality and fewer pro features.

    "description": "One of Samsung&#39;s CEOs, Jong-hee Han, has died due to a heart attack, according to Reuters and CNBC . He was 63. Han joined the company in 1988 and became the head of product research and development for visual display in 2011. He then led Samsung&#39;s TV business before he was named as the head of Samsung DX, which is what the company calls its merged mobile and consumer electronics divisions, in 2021. In 2022, he officially became the company&#39;s Vice Chairman and CEO. Han had no experience in mobile before he started leading the company&#39;s DX group, but Samsung gave him credit for helping it get to the top of global TV sales for 15 years.&nbsp; CNBC says Han was one of the executives who hosted Samsung&#39;s annual general shareholders meeting just a week ago and answered questions about the company&#39;s poor stock performance. During the meeting, Han apologized to the shareholders, telling them that Samsung &quot;failed to adequately respond to the rapidly evolving AI semiconductor market.&quot; He also told the shareholders that Samsung was having difficulties when it came to semiconductor-related mergers and acquisitions due to regulatory issues, but that the company was &quot;determined to produce some tangible results this year.&quot; Based on the notice Samsung published , Han&#39;s co-CEO Young-Hyun Jun is now the sole CEO of the company.

    "description": "The next feature for next-gen Apple Watches could be AI assistant-boosting cameras. Apple is reportedly working on adding cameras to future Apple Watch models to make them more like AI wearables, according to Bloomberg ’s Mark Gurman. Unlike the ancient watch cameras from decades ago, I’d expect the camera to be as subtle as front-facing cameras on an iPhone, not the giant units on the back. Cameras may not be for FaceTime calls or photography but could help the Apple Watch support AI features like Visual Intelligence, which can provide on-the-spot information. Gurman previously reported Apple is developing AirPods with a built-in camera for similar functionality. Do you know which company tried cramming a camera into its smartwatch? This one . That was also over a decade ago. Engadget Apple is contending with other Watch issues too: a rumored plastic Apple Watch SE has reportedly hit some development issues . According to Gurman (he’s a busy guy!): “The design team doesn’t like the look, and the operations team is finding it difficult to make the casing materially cheaper than the current aluminum chassis.” It’s been over two years since Apple released the second-generation Apple Watch SE. We even took a second look at the wearable , anticipating` an eventual replacement. — Mat Smith Get this delivered direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!

    "title": "The best monitors for every budget in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-monitor-130006843.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The good news when it comes to buying monitors is that there has never been more choice, with numerous options for every type of use ranging from productivity to content creation to gaming. The problem is that all that choice can make it challenging to decide which one is best for your particular needs and budget. In this guide we can help you make that decision and show you which factors are most important, whether they be color accuracy, size, ergonomics or refresh rates. We used that information to gather the top picks, including options from our own monitor reviews, to help you find the one that best fits your needs. Table of Contents Best monitors for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a monitor Best monitors for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a monitor Panel type The cheapest monitors are still TN (twisted nematic), which are strictly for gamers or office use. VA (vertical alignment) monitors are also relatively cheap, while offering good brightness and a high contrast ratio. However, content creators will find that LCD, IPS monitors (in-plane switching) deliver better color accuracy, pixel density, picture quality and viewing angles. If maximum brightness is important, a quantum dot LCD display is the way to go — those are typically found in larger displays. OLED monitors are now available and offer the best blacks and color reproduction, but they lack the brightness of LED or quantum dot displays. Plus, they’re expensive. The latest type of OLED monitor, called QD-OLED from Samsung, is now common among gaming monitors. The most notable advantage is that it can get a lot brighter, with recent models hitting up to 1,000 nits+ of peak brightness. MiniLEDs are now widely used in high-end displays. They’re similar to quantum dot tech, but as the name suggests, it uses smaller LED diodes that are just 0.2mm in diameter. As such, manufacturers can pack in up to three times more LEDs with more local dimming zones, delivering deeper blacks and better contrast. Screen size, resolution and display format Where 24-inch displays used to be more or less standard (and can still be useful for basic computing), 27-, 32-, 34- and even 42-inch displays have become popular for entertainment, content creation and even gaming these days. Nearly every monitor used to be 16:9, but it’s now possible to find 16:10 and other more exotic display shapes. On the gaming and entertainment side, we’re also seeing curved and ultrawide monitors with aspect ratios like 21:9. If you do decide to buy an ultrawide display, however, keep in mind that a 30-inch 21:9 model is the same height as a 24-inch monitor, so you might end up with a smaller display than you expected. A 4K monitor is nearly a must for content creators, and some folks are even going for 5K or all the way up to 8K. Keep in mind, though, that you’ll need a pretty powerful computer with a decent graphics card to drive all those sharp pixels. And 4K resolution should be paired with a screen size of 27 inches and up, or you won’t notice much difference between 1440p. At the same time, I wouldn’t get a model larger than 27 inches unless it’s 4K, as you’ll start to see pixelation if you’re working up close to the display. One new category to consider is portable monitors designed to be carried and used with laptops. Those typically come in 1080p resolutions and sizes from 13-15 inches. They usually have a lightweight kickstand-type support that folds up to keep things compact. HDR HDR adds vibrancy to entertainment and gaming – but be careful before jumping in. Some monitors that claim HDR on their marketing materials don’t even conform to a base standard. To be sure that a display at least meets minimum HDR specs, you’ll want to choose one with a DisplayHDR rating with each tier representing maximum brightness in nits. However, the lowest DisplayHDR 400 and 500 tiers may disappoint you with a lack of brightness, washed out blacks and mediocre color reproduction. If you can afford it, the best monitor to choose is a model with DisplayHDR 600, 1000 or True Black 400, True Black 500 and True Black 600. Where televisions typically offer HDR10 and Dolby Vision or HDR10+, most PC monitors only support the HDR10 standard, other than a few (very expensive) models. That doesn’t matter much for content creation or gaming, but HDR streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services won’t look quite as punchy. In addition, the best gaming monitors are usually the ones supporting HDR600 (and up), rather than content creation monitors – with a few exceptions. Refresh rate Refresh rate is a key feature, particularly on gaming monitors. A bare minimum nowadays is 60Hz, and 80Hz and higher refresh rates are much easier on the eyes. However, most 4K displays top out at 60Hz with some rare exceptions and the HDMI 2.0 spec only supports 4K at 60Hz, so you’d need at least DisplayPort 1.4 (4K at 120Hz) or HDMI 2.1. The latter is now available on a number of monitors, particularly gaming displays. However, it’s only supported by the latest NVIDIA RTX 3000- and 4000-series, AMD RX 6000-series GPUs. Inputs There are essentially three types of modern display inputs: Thunderbolt, DisplayPort and HDMI. Most monitors built for PCs come with the latter two, while a select few (typically built for Macs) will use Thunderbolt. To add to the confusion, USB-C ports may be Thunderbolt 3, and by extension, DisplayPort compatible, so you may need a USB-C to Thunderbolt or DisplayPort cable adapter depending on your display. Color bit depth Serious content creators should consider a more costly 10-bit monitor that can display billions of colors. If budget is an issue, you can go for an 8-bit panel that can fake billions of colors via dithering (often spec’d as “8-bit + FRC”). For entertainment or business purposes, a regular 8-bit monitor that can display millions of colors will be fine. Color gamut The other aspect of color is the gamut. That expresses the range of colors that can be reproduced and not just the number of colors. Most good monitors these days can cover the sRGB and Rec.709 gamuts (designed for photos and video respectively). For more demanding work, though, you’ll want one that can reproduce more demanding modern gamuts like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3 and Rec.2020 gamuts, which encompass a wider range of colors. The latter two are often used for film projection and HDR, respectively.

    "description": "Netflix has announced that it&#39;s adding support for HDR10+ streaming , on top of the existing HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats that are already offered on the streaming service. HDR10+ should offer greater visual fidelity on a per-frame basis for Netflix&#39;s frequently dark original programming. The company is enabling HDR10+ with the AV1 codec, the specification originally released in 2018 that&#39;s gradually become the standard for streaming 4K video without gobbling data. Netflix first adopted AV1 as a way to help customers save data while watching on their phone, but the compression tech works just as well for streaming large HDR files. Netflix is enabling HDR10+ on select popular titles now, and hopes to eventually offer all HDR content in the new format. Anyone with a Netflix Premium subscription and a device that supports both HDR10+ and AV1 (which includes most modern mobile phones and tablets) should be able to watch compatible content in HDR10+. After 4K, high dynamic range (HDR) has come to define the look of modern TV and movies, particularly on streaming. HDR content makes clear the stark differences between the light and dark parts of an image. The under-exposed, muddy quality of modern streaming TV is frequently due to an expectation that audiences will be viewing on a device that supports HDR. Without it, you can&#39;t see anything. With it, you can pick up all the various shades of gray that have become the norm in prestige TV.&nbsp; Netflix first rolled out support for HDR in 2016 with the debut of Marco Polo , and in the years since, has made supporting Dolby Vision and HDR10, the most common HDR format, the norm on its service. If you&#39;ve been watching Netflix on a display that already uses Dolby Vision, you likely won&#39;t notice a difference, but if you&#39;re TV only offers HDR10+, adding support for the format should make watching everything a little bit better.

    "description": "DNA testing company 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , following a tumultuous few years that included significant layoffs and a wide-ranging data breach . It plans to find a buyer and continue operations throughout the process, with the company&#39;s CEO, Anne Wojcicki, resigning to bid for the company independently. The Board of Directors&#39; Special Committee previously rejected a proposal from Wojcicki. &quot;We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities. We believe in the value of our people and our assets and hope that this process allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on for the benefit of customers and patients,&quot; said Mark Jensen, chair and member of the Special Committee, in a release . Jensen added that the company is committed to safeguarding customer data and that &quot;being transparent about the management of user data going forward, and data privacy will be an important consideration in any potential transaction.&quot; There was a time when 23andMe was all the rage, with everyone you knew sending samples of their saliva. However, things have declined since the company went public. It was once valued at $6 billion , but this month that number was less than $50 million. The company also laid off over 200 employees late last year. But, the largest hurdle came in 2023 when hackers accessed the information of 6.9 million customers — the breach started in April of that year, but 23andM3 noticed it five months later , in September. The company announced the leak that October . One year later, 23andMe settled a class action lawsuit for $30 million , following claims such as that the company failed to tell plaintiffs that they were specifically targeted for being of Chinese or Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Following the news, California Attorney General Rob Bonta recommended 23andMe customers delete their data as a precaution.

    "description": "23andMe has capped off a challenging few years by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy today. Given the uncertainty around the future of the DNA testing company and what will happen to all of the genetic data it has collected, now is a critical time for customers to protect their privacy. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has recommended that past customers of the genetic testing business delete their information as a precautionary measure. Here are the steps to deleting your records with 23andMe. Log into your 23andMe account. Go to the &quot;Settings&quot; tab of your profile. Click View on the section called &quot;23andMe Data.&quot; If you want to retain a copy for your own records, download your data now. Go to the &quot;Delete Data&quot; section Click &quot;Permanently Delete Data.&quot; You will receive an email from 23andMe confirming the action. Click the link in that email to complete the process. While the majority of an individual&#39;s personal information will be deleted, 23andMe does keep some information for legal compliance. The details are in the company&#39;s privacy policy . There are a few other privacy-minded actions customers can take. First, anyone who opted to have 23andMe store their saliva and DNA can request that the sample be destroyed. That choice can be made from the Preferences tab of the account settings menu. Second, you can review whether you granted permission for your genetic data and sample to be used in scientific research. The allowance can also be checked, and revoked if you wish, from the account settings page; it&#39;s listed under Research and Product Consents.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-midrange-smartphone-183006463.html?src=rss",
    "description": "A great phone doesn’t need to cost a fortune. In 2025, features once exclusive to high-end devices – big batteries, multi-camera arrays, high refresh rate displays and more – have trickled down to more affordable models. Sure, you’ll still need to buy a flagship smartphone to get the best camera or fastest processor, but you don’t need to compromise nearly as much anymore if you’re looking for a great handset at a reasonable price. If you have less than $600 to spend, let us help you figure out what features to prioritize when trying to find the best midrange smartphone. Editor&#39;s note (3/24/25): We&#39;re looking forward to testing out the new Google Pixel 9a in the near future. We&#39;ll update our top picks again once we have a full review of the Pixel 9a, but for now, our current top picks still stand. The best midrange phones for 2025 What is a midrange phone, anyway? While the term frequently appears in articles and videos, there isn’t an agreed-upon definition for “midrange” beyond a phone that isn’t a flagship or an entry-level option. Most of our recommendations cost between $400 and $600 — any less and you should expect significant compromises. If you have more to spend, you might as well consider flagships like the Apple iPhone 16 and the Samsung Galaxy S25 . What to consider before buying a midrange smartphone Buying a new device can be intimidating, but a few questions can help guide you through the process. First: what platform do you want to use? If the answer is iOS, that narrows your options down to exactly one phone. (Thankfully, it’s great.) And if you’re an Android fan, there’s no shortage of compelling options. Both platforms have their strengths, so you shouldn’t rule either out. Of course, also consider how much you’re comfortable spending. Even increasing your budget by $100 more can get you a dramatically better product. Moreover, manufacturers tend to support their more expensive devices for longer. It’s worth buying something toward the top limit of what you can afford. Having an idea of your priorities will help inform your budget. Do you want a long battery life or fast charging? Do you value speedy performance above all else? Or would you like the best possible cameras? While they continue to improve every year, even the best midrange smartphones still demand some compromises, and knowing what’s important to you will make choosing one easier. What won’t you get from a midrange smartphone? Every year, the line between midrange and flagship phones blurs as more upmarket features and specs trickle down to more affordable models. When Engadget first published this guide in 2020, it was tricky to find a $500 phone with waterproofing and 5G. In 2025, the biggest thing you might miss out on is wireless charging – and even then, that’s becoming less true. One thing your new phone probably won’t come with is a power adapter; many companies have stopped including chargers with all of their smartphones. Performance has improved in recent years, but can still be hit or miss as most midrange phones use slower processors that can struggle with multitasking. Thankfully, their cameras have improved dramatically, and you can typically expect at least a dual-lens system on most midrange smartphones below $600.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-adds-option-to-edit-continue-watching-list-182856588.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Disney is giving Disney+ subscribers the ability to edit their &quot;Continue Watching&quot; lists , a quality-of-life feature that&#39;s been oddly missing from the streaming service up until now. Continue Watching collects all of the TV shows, movies and live events you&#39;ve started watching, saving your place so you can pick up right where you left off. If you dip in and out of watching things, it&#39;s very easy for the list to get unwieldy quickly, so being able to edit it is helpful. You can remove something from Continue Watching in two different ways: directly from the list itself or the Details page of a given show or movie. If you&#39;re on your TV and want to edit your list, you just highlight a movie or show with your remote, press and hold the remote&#39;s button (on the Apple TV remote, for example, its the center button) and then select &quot;Remove&quot; when the menu slides over. From the Details page of the show or movie you want to remove, just highlight and select the &quot;Remove&quot; icon (it&#39;s a minus symbol) to get it out of your list. The process is similar on the web or in Disney+ mobile app. If you&#39;re watching Disney+ on your phone, you can just tap on the three dots in the corner of a show or movie in Continue Watching and then tap on Remove . On the web, just hover your mouse over anything in Continue Watching and click on the Remove icon in the corner of the movie or show. The only thing you can&#39;t remove from Continue Watching are live events, which will stay until they officially end.&nbsp; Disney says the ability to edit Continue Watching is available today on the web, iOS devices and Apple TV, and will be coming to the other platforms Disney+ is on in the coming weeks.

The company announced this feature update in a blog post, saying that the Drive app for Windows is &quot;generally available&quot; for Snapdragon X chipsets. Today’s release follows a beta test going back to last year. This includes machines by several big brands, with the most notable being the newest Microsoft Surface laptops . The Drive port for Arm-based PCs also allows users to access their accounts through the Windows File Explorer app. This should make it easier to pull files from Drive accounts. The native app only works on devices running Windows 11 and Microsoft WebView2. Existing beta users will automatically be updated to the full version. It’s rolling out today but could take up to 15 days to hit everyone’s accounts.

    "title": "Nothing’s Essential Spaces is an AI-powered app done right",

    "description": "The most notable feature of Nothing’s latest phones may be its combo of distinct hardware design and Android software tweaks. However, after using the Nothing Phone 3a for a few weeks, the Essential Space app has kept me hooked on what is ostensibly a lower-mid-range smartphone. It’s also a hard app to explain in a single sentence. It’s a little bit of a screenshot gallery, a little bit of a notes app, a little bit of a to-do list app, a little bit of country, a little bit of rock-and-roll. It’s all sewn together with similar AI features to what we&#39;ve seen on most new smartphones. However, compared to the disjointed apps and features of Google AI, Galaxy AI, or Apple Intelligence, Essential Space keeps everything in one place. The utility is helped by having a dedicated launcher button (the Essential Key): A single press will screenshot your phone (and file it in Space), while a long press starts recording your voice — and files it away in Space, too, initiating AI-powered transcription. A double press of the Essential Key launches the app, which seems odd. The screenshot should also be a double press, but maybe that’s just me. It’s not an entirely new premise. We raved about Google’s Pixel Screenshot app , which also does a good job of organizing your screenshots to make things easier to find. However, Google’s Screenshots app is limited to only that — screenshots. Nothing, on the other hand, already announced it’ll bring a similar-seeming Smart Collections feature to the Space app in the future. Inside Nothing’s Space app, the phone extracts dates, attempts to create to-do lists, analyzes screenshots and associates them with time, date, and location data. In short, it makes it easier to remember why I took a screenshot when I did, and it even attempts to create actionable items and reminders. I’ve started taking voice notes and mulling over everything I must do on a workday morning. It&#39;ll summarize it into a to-do list with goals I can check off when completed. With Essential Space, Nothing doesn’t seem to be meddling with AI for the sake of it. While image generation, rewriting emails, and writing guidance on my smartphone are occasionally fun, Essential Space removes many roadblocks to using these functions. I don’t have to ask the Phone 3a to transcribe your voice recordings; it just gets to work. There are limitations, perhaps predictably, given the middleweight processor of a mid-range phone, and AI processing happens on the cloud. Nothing says it deletes processing requests from its servers after they’re completed. However, phones that cost over twice as much as the Phone 3a can handle AI processing on-device for most things that Essential Space can do. There is also no way to share something with Space, whether a photo or a recording unless you initiate the recording through that pesky Essential Key. Of course, you can take screenshots of old screenshots, photos, and websites, but then you’re back to the same disjointed process as other Android devices and iPhones. Nothing’s Essential Space manages to streamline AI into many of the features I use most, like transcription and reminders. The company has teased further functionality, like a focused search for use inside the Space app, and cutesy gimmicks like flip-to-record for your voice notes, which should only bolster what I thought would be weird software curio. It isn’t earth-shattering, but put all together, it&#39;s one of the best integrations of AI aimed at making your life easier.

    "title": "Apple is finally updating AirPods Max with lossless and ultra-low latency audio",

    "description": "No, pigs aren’t flying, hell hasn’t frozen over and you (probably) haven’t won the Powerball jackpot, but something else nearly as unexpected is happening. Over four years after it debuted AirPods Max , Apple is set to update them with long-overdue features. The company is bringing lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio to the overear headphones when it rolls out iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia 15.4 in April . This is the only major update Apple has given the AirPods Max so far, outside of starting to offer a model with a USB-C charging port back in September . And that&#39;s the kicker: the update will only be for the USB-C version of the AirPods Max, not the original version with the Lightning port. This is due to technical constraints on the Lightning model, such as digital-to-analog converter performance. What&#39;s more, lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio won&#39;t be available in wireless mode. To take advantage of these features, you&#39;ll need to connect the headphones to an audio source via a USB-C cable. As luck would have it, Apple is starting to sell a USB-C to 3.5mm cable today. That will run you $39. There will also be the option to connect your iOS or iPadOS device to speakers or car stereos that have 3.5mm audio ports with the cable. Still, you&#39;ll at last be able to listen to 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio with AirPods Max, as long as you have the USB-C model. Lossless audio will also be compatible with Personalized Spatial Audio, Apple says. Apple Music subscribers can listen to more than 100 million songs in lossless audio. The company notes that, following the firmware update, &quot;AirPods Max will become the only headphones that enable musicians to both create and mix in Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking.&quot; It adds that the ultra-low latency audio feature will allow for no response delay on par with the speakers built into Mac, iPad and iPhone devices. It suggests this feature could be a boon for gamers and livestreamers. Update March 24, 12:08PM ET: Added clarification that lossless and ultra-low latency audio will only be available on the USB-C version of AirPods Max and only in wired mode.

    "description": "The PlayStation 5 release date for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has been revealed. MachineGames&#39; latest Nazi-thwacking simulator will hit Sony&#39;s console on April 17, just four months after it debuted on Xbox and PC. If you pony up for the digital premium edition or physical collector&#39;s bundle, you&#39;ll get early access to the game on April 15 (plus some other goodies). Digital pre-orders are open now and physical pre-orders go live tomorrow, March 25. Microsoft confirmed last August that it would bring a port of the tremendously enjoyable blockbuster to Sony&#39;s console this spring as part of its shift away from platform exclusivity. We&#39;ve seen a number of notable former Xbox exclusives come to PS5 (and Switch in some cases) over the last year or so. Among them are Sea of Thieves , Hi-Fi Rush , Pentiment and Grounded . Forza Horizon 5 is also PS5-bound on April 29 . Meanwhile, Doom: The Dark Ages will hit PS5 on May 15 , the same day it&#39;s set to land on PC and Xbox. Rumors suggest that a remastered collection of the first three Gears of War games is coming to Sony&#39;s system. The rebooted Fable and even Xbox&#39;s flagship Halo series could make the leap over to PlayStation as well, as the walls around Microsoft&#39;s gaming garden continue to crumble.

    "description": "The Amazon Spring Sale has brought a number of discounts to Shark vacuums , both cordless and robotic varieties. On the robot vacuum side of things, you can get the well-regarded Shark AI Ultra robovac for $300, or more than $100 off its regular price. This is a version of one of our top picks for the best robot vacuums . It has strong suction power, an easy-to-use mobile app and an extra-large, self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It’s great for pet hair and all-around cleaning tasks. The only major downside is that this isn’t a hybrid unit, so it doesn’t mop. For that, consider the Shark Matrix Plus. This 2-in-1 robovac vacuums and mops, and it’s currently on sale for $400 . That’s a massive discount of 47 percent, as the typical price is an eyebrow-raising $750. This one also includes a self-emptying base that can accommodate 60 days of dirt and debris. It boasts a true HEPA filter and excels at mopping away deep stains. This is thanks to powerful scrubbers that operate at 100 times per minute. We couldn’t truly recommend this model at its original price, as that’s a whole lot of cheddar, but it’s a steal right now for $400.

    "description": "You have to be patient if you want to take advantage of the best streaming deals because they don&#39;t come around as often as discounts on laptops and smartphones. One of the best deals as of late is a new one from Disney: new and returning subscribers can get four months of the Disney+ Hulu Duo Basic bundle for only $12. You&#39;ll pay $3 per month for four months, and that represents a 72-percent discount off the standard $11-per-month price. For the whole period, you&#39;ll save a total of $32. The deal is available through March 30, but just keep in mind that the Duo Basic plan includes advertisements on both Disney+ and Hulu content. At a time when it feels like every streaming service, audio and video, is pushing their subscription costs ever-higher, it&#39;s a treat to get any amount of entertainment access for a discount. That&#39;s why we&#39;re big fans of the Disney+ Hulu Duo plans; even at the normal rate, it unites two of our favorite standalone content libraries in a single package that&#39;s a solid deal at its normal rates.&nbsp; Snagging the basic tier for an even lower cost feels like a no-brainer, especially if you&#39;re invested in any facet of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, if you&#39;re counting the days until the second season of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives or if you just like to hum along with Encanto in the background while you work.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the ad-free Duo Premium plan isn&#39;t covered in this promotion, nor is the option that also bundles ESPN into the package. Access to Duo Premium will still run you $20 a month, while the Trio bundles begin at $17 a month.

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/636089/microsoft-365-copilot-reasoning-ai-agents",
    "description": "Copilot AI agents After Google and OpenAI offered up AI news on Tuesday, Microsoft has followed with announcements of its own , including details of two “deep reasoning” agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot that it claims are the first of their kind, dubbed Researcher and Analyst, as well as new capabilities for custom AI agents. Researcher relies on OpenAI’s deep research AI model to pull off “complex, multi-step research,” along with access to third-party data via connectors to sources like Salesforce or ServiceNow so that business customers can derive insights from across their tools. Analyst is based on the o3-mini reasoning model from OpenAI, and Microsoft claims that with chain-of-thought reasoning, it’s capable of turning raw data into spreadsheets, running Python code that you can view while it’s running, and operate on the level of a skilled data scientist, pulling together reports like this one (pdf) . Those tools are scheduled to start rolling out in April to Microsoft 365 Copilot license holders in an early access program, along with new autonomous agent capabilities that are starting to roll out now in Copilot Studio. Microsoft claims the new agent flows in Copilot are powerful enough to “automate any task you can imagine” with rule-based workflows that include AI actions. The LinkedIn announcement describes situations like an agent flow that directs feedback emails to the correct team, but we’ll have to see it in action to find out how that’s better than adding a checkbox or two, or how well its “low code” experience really works, and if it can deliver on the promises AI companies are making about agents.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/tech/634880/amazon-big-spring-sale-march-2025-prime-day-deals-shop",
    "description": "Just as flower buds are beginning to bloom to mark the seasonal shift toward warmer months, Amazon is hosting its first big sales event of 2025. The Big Spring Sale , as it is known, is live, and runs through Monday, March 31st, bringing with it a slew of discounts on gardening supplies, bedding, and other necessities. While the discounts aren’t as steep as during tentpole events like Prime Day or even Amazon’s October event, you can still find steep savings on security cameras , headphones , smartwatches , and loads of other tech. We’ve dug into all the deals and discounts available so far, the best of which you’ll find below. By and large, most of the deals will last until the end of the event. And, while having a Prime subscription means your packages will certainly arrive more quickly, you don’t necessarily need to be a member to get in on these tried-and-tested Verge favorites. We’ll also be keeping an eye on deals at competing retailers, including Best Buy , Walmart , and Target . Featured deals Headphone and earbud deals Speaker and soundbar deals Smart home deals Tablet and e-reader deals Smartwatch and fitness tracker deals Other Verge favorites Featured deals Headphone and earbud deals The Beats Studio Pro are on sale at Amazon , Walmart , and Best Buy for $179.95 ($170 off), which remains one of the best prices we’ve seen. Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C. Plus, unlike most noise-canceling headphones, they offer native support for both iOS and Android software features. Read our review . If you prefer a pair of noise-canceling earbuds that support native software features on both iOS and Android, the Beats Studio Buds Plus are available at Amazon , Walmart , and Best Buy for around $130 ($40 off), nearly matching their best price to date. Yes, their lack of wireless charging and in-ear detection stings a bit at their typical list price, but their see-through design is slick enough that the shortcomings are (almost) forgivable. Read our review . If you’re not dead set on noise cancellation but would still like a pair of Apple earbuds, the recently released AirPods 4 are matching their all-time low of $99.99 ($30 off) at Amazon and Walmart right now. They’re a substantial upgrade over the prior model when it comes to call clarity and sound, and they offer the same seamless integration with macOS, iOS, and tvOS as the rest of Apple’s earbuds. Read our review . The Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2e — aka, the best-sounding wireless headphones you can buy — are available at Amazon starting at $296.71 (about $102 off), or from Bower &amp; Wilkins or Best Buy for $319.99 ($80 off). The British audio brand isn’t as well-known as Sony or Bose, though with the S2E, you’re getting superb sound, superior build quality, and controls that rely on physical buttons as opposed to the tap/swipe gestures found on mainstream noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s XM5.&nbsp; Read our review . Anker’s Soundcore Sport X20 earbuds &nbsp;are on sale at&nbsp; Amazon ,&nbsp; Best Buy , and&nbsp; Walmart &nbsp;for $63.99 ($16 off), matching their second-best price to date. The fitness-friendly buds are a lot like the Sport X10 — which were once our&nbsp; favorite budget earbuds for the gym &nbsp;— only they offer longer battery life, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and multipoint support. They also supposedly offer better noise cancellation and continue to sport an adjustable ear hook, which is a boon if you’re someone who struggles with keeping traditional earbuds in during intense gym sessions. Speaker and soundbar deals JBL’s Charge 5 is on sale at Amazon , Best Buy , and Walmart in multiple colors starting at $119.95 ($60 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker since July. We’re not huge fans of the oversized JBL logo, but the powerful Bluetooth speaker hits all the right marks when it comes to functionality and performance, offering an impressive 20 hours of battery life and a built-in USB-A port that lets you top off your phone while listening to music. Despite the fact the Sonos app has been a bit of a debacle as of late, I have few qualms about recommending the Sonos Era 100 for $199 ($50 off), its current price at Amazon , Best Buy , and Sonos’ online storefront . It’s a great smart speaker with stereo sound, privacy-conscious microphone controls, and support for both Bluetooth and line-in connections. It can also connect to Spotify and every other music service you can think of and supports AirPlay 2, letting you stream content from Apple devices. Read our review . Amazon’s latest Echo Dot is down to $39.99 ($10 off) at Amazon , Best Buy , and Kohl’s . The tiny, orb-shaped smart speaker features onboard microphones and produces good sound for its size, making it a solid option for listening to music, issuing smart home commands, checking the weather, and making other various Alexa requests. It also includes a built-in temperature sensor, which can tell you the temperature in the room and trigger&nbsp;various Alexa Routines, if necessary. Read our review . Sony’s SRS-XB100 speaker&nbsp; is available at&nbsp; Amazon &nbsp;and&nbsp; Best Buy &nbsp;for around $48 ($12 off) or at&nbsp; Target &nbsp;for $39.99 if you’re a member of the retailer’s free loyalty program. Despite the fact it’s tiny, the Bluetooth speaker delivers crisp, clear sound along with up to 16 hours of continuous battery life. It also sports IP67 dust and water resistance, so you can take it hiking or to the pool without worrying.&nbsp; Read our review . Want a compact smart display for your nightstand? Amazon’s&nbsp; latest&nbsp; Echo Show 5 &nbsp;is on sale at&nbsp; Amazon ,&nbsp; Best Buy , and&nbsp; B&amp;H Photo &nbsp;for $69.99 ($20 off), which is a pretty typical discount. The Alexa-enabled smart display is Amazon’s smallest at 5.5 inches, though it’s still plenty big enough for managing smart home devices and controlling music playback. It also has a 2-megapixel camera (with an integrated privacy shutter), just in case you want to use it for more than a smart alarm clock. Smart home deals Ring’s latest Indoor Cam is on sale at Amazon , Best Buy , and The Home Depot for $39.99 ($20 off), matching its second-best price to date. The 1080p security camera boasts all the same features as the prior model — including two-way talk, color night vision, and a built-in siren — only it’s equipped with a redesigned mount that makes it easier to adjust. That said, you’ll need a Ring Protect Plan ($4.99 a month / $49.99 a year) to share or view video recordings. Verge smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy recommends the Roborock Q5 Pro for those who want a budget-friendly robot vacuum that’s skilled in the arcane art of sucking up pet hair. Fortunately, the Q50 Pro Plus model is on sale at Amazon with its auto-empty bin for just $299.99 ($400 off) — a $70 upcharge on the standard Q50 Pro that’s well worth it if your space has a lot of fur to sweep up. You can grab a four-pack of Meross Smart Plug Minis on sale at Amazon for just $31.99 ($15 off), an all-time low. That brings the handy, hubless smart plugs down to just $8 a pop, allowing you to control a range of traditional devices via Apple Home, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa without breaking the bank. Tablet and e-reader deals Amazon’s ad-supported Fire HD 10 tablet is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy right now with 32GB of storage starting at $94.99 ($45 off), or about $20 shy of its lowest price to date. The 2023 model sports USB-C charging, a 10.1-inch, 1080p display, and 3GB of RAM, which is plenty if all you’re doing is streaming or browsing. Just be aware that, like all of Amazon’s budget-minded tablets, it’s really focused on serving up Amazon content at every turn. If you prefer a big-screen, note-taking alternative to the Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Colorsoft, the 2024 Kindle Scribe is matching its all-time low of $324.99 ($75 off) at Amazon and Best Buy with 32GB of storage. It remains the biggest Kindle available thanks to its 10.2-inch 300 ppi display, which features a textured cover that makes it feel more akin to writing on paper. The latest model offers a host of new writing features, too, including a tool that lets you jot notes directly in your book. Read our review . Smartwatch and fitness tracker deals Amazon and Walmart are both selling the Garmin Venu Sq 2 starting at around $187 ($62 off), which matches its second-best price to date. Although not originally priced as such, it’s considered an entry-level fitness watch for Garmin fans . It’s pretty stylish, overall, and can last just as long and do just as much as a Fitbit (if not more). We also like it for its wide breadth of health and workout-tracking features, along with its support for built-in GPS and contactless payments. Read our full review . Other Verge favorites We’ve said it several times before, but if all you need is a basic monochrome laser printer, just buy whatever Brother model is on sale. Right now, that’s the Brother HL-L2400D printer , which is matching its all-time low of $99.99 ($20 off) at Amazon as part of the retailer’s spring sales event. It’s not really suited for photo use or anything fancy, but it connects to Wi-Fi, works reliably, and lasts ages on a single toner cartridge. It also supports automatic duplex printing, so, you know, it has that going for it. We like Hoto’s svelte toolkits for a couple of reasons. They strike a minimalistic look, for one thing, and they incorporate at least one power tool. The company’s Drill Tool Set — which is on sale at Amazon for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools. Pet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the ChomChom Roller , especially since it&#8217;s currently on sale at Amazon for $19.59 ($5 off). This simple tool can de-fur your couch faster and more effectively than most vacuums, even if it’s not the best tool for ridding clothes of unwanted hair. The Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at Amazon in a myriad of colors starting at $89.99 ($40 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup. One of our go-to gift guide picks, the Instant Pot Duo Plus , is currently available for an all-time low of $89.95 ($40 off) at Amazon . Multiple Verge staffers swear by the six-quart multi-cooker, which is similar to the base-model instant pot but comes with a few additional smart programs, including a customizable sous vide setting and a cake option that lets you pressure cook at high temperature for 40 minutes. That’s in addition to the ability to cook rice, steam veggies, and sauté, among other actions. If you’re someone who owns (or, someday, envisions owning) USB-C gadgets that draw a lot of power, it’s wise to buy cables with high wattage passthrough, just so you’re ready for the future. Anker’s six-foot 240W USB-C cable is a great candidate, especially since it’s discounted to $16.99 ($8 off) at Amazon . Ugreen’s Uno lineup of charging accessories aims to be more personable. To that end, its 6.6-foot 1ooW USB-C cable — which is currently discounted to $10.39 ($2.61 off) at Amazon — has expressive, Tamagotchi-like eyes. The reason? There’s no reason — it’s just cute, okay? Govee may be best known for its ambient TV backlighting, but it also makes lighting products to illuminate your entire living space in shades of RGB. One of its most stunning lights, the Smart Table Lamp 2 , is on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) at Amazon . It can provide vibrant lights for a gathering, or you can adjust its color temperature to suit your bedtime and wake-up rituals better. Having access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed. If you’ll be out in the wild, or if you’re vacationing but want to be cautious when it comes to water intake, the LifeStraw Peak is worth picking up at Amazon for its current price of $18.62 ($6 off). It’s essentially a thick straw outfitted with a filter that’s capable of removing 99.9 percent of bacteria, parasites, and microplastics from the water you’re drinking. The AeroPress Go is nearly matching its best price to date at Amazon , where you can pick it up for $31.95 ($18 off). It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst Verge staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier. Power banks with built-in USB-C cables are the hot thing right now. As it turns out, having a battery pack that can charge your device in a jiffy and double as a lanyard is pretty great. Luckily, you can snag one of the most affordable 20,000mAh models out there, Anker’s 30W Zolo power bank , for $24.61 (about $11 off) at Amazon . While it’s not powerful enough to quickly charge a Steam Deck that’s running games, it’ll do just fine for charging it (as well as other USB-C devices) while they sleep. Update, March 25th: Updated to reflect current pricing/availability and several new deals, including those for the Glocusent book light, the Hisense U8N, and the AeroPress Go coffee maker.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/634974/character-ai-parental-insights-chatbot-report-kids",
    "description": "Chatbot service Character.AI is adding a new &#8216;Parental Insights&#8217; feature, which lets teens send a weekly report of their chatbot usage to a parents&#8217; email address. As outlined in an announcement from the company, this report includes the daily average time spent across web and mobile, the characters that a user most frequently interacted with, and how much time they spent talking to each character. It&#8217;s part of a series of updates designed to address concerns about minors spending too much time with chatbots and encountering inappropriate content during chats. The report, which doesn&#8217;t require parents to have an account, is optional and can be set up by minor users in Character.AI&#8217;s settings. The company notes that it&#8217;s an overview of teens&#8217; activity, not a complete log — so the contents of chatbot conversations won&#8217;t be shared. The platform bars kids under 13 years of age in most locations and under 16 in Europe. Character.AI has been introducing new features for underage users since last year, coinciding with concerns — and even legal complaints — about its service. The platform, which is popular with teenagers, allows users to create and customize chatbots that they interact with or share publicly. But multiple lawsuits allege that these bots have offered inappropriately sexualized content or material that promoted self-harm. It also reportedly received warnings from Apple and Google (which hired Character.AI&#8217;s founders last year) about its app&#8217;s content. The company says that its system has since been redesigned; among other changes, it moved under-18 users to a model trained to avoid &#8220;sensitive&#8221; output and added more prominent notifications reminding users that the bots weren&#8217;t real people. But with enthusiasm for AI regulation and child safety laws booming, this likely won&#8217;t be the last step the company is called to take.",

    "title": "Google says its new ‘reasoning’ Gemini AI models are the best ones yet",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/635502/google-gemini-2-5-reasoning-ai-model",
    "description": "After delivering a new “open” AI model with better performance on a single GPU , Google has now introduced an update to the AI models for its products with Gemini 2.5 , which combines “a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training” for better overall performance. It’s claiming that the first release, Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental, leads competition from OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and DeepSeek on common AI benchmarks that measure understanding, mathematics, coding, and other capabilities. The new model is available to access in Google AI Studio or for Gemini Advanced subscribers in the app’s model dropdown menu. The company is also touting Gemini’s native multimodality as an advantage, as it’s able to interpret not just text, but also audio, still images, video, and code, and says that a 2 million token context window is “coming soon” to help it process more data. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called Gemini 2.5 Pro “an awesome state-of-the-art model, no.1 on LMArena by a whopping +39 ELO points, with significant improvements across the board in multimodal reasoning, coding &amp; STEM,” in a post on X . Google says it’s jumped forward in quality because Gemini models are now “reasoning” models that process tasks step-by-step and make more informed decisions, which they say results in better answers and responses for complex prompts. Now, the blog post reads, “&#8230;we’re building these thinking capabilities directly into all of our models, so they can handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.” One demo video shows 2.5 Pro using those reasoning capabilities to program a video game based on a single prompt:",

    "title": "“This man is not our boss” — EPA workers rally against DOGE cuts",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/635710/doge-musk-trump-environmental-protection-agency-epa",
    "description": "Harper Stanfield and Suzanne Englot took park in the in the National Day of Action joining EPA workers across the US protesting cuts to the agency. Environmental Protection Agency workers took to the streets across the US today to protest drastic cuts President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE have made at the federal agency whose mission is to “protect human health and the environment.” Musk, the face of DOGE and the target of growing protests at Tesla dealerships , was a bigger name at the rally than Trump. “How do you spell corruption? E-L-O-N” workers and their supporters chanted at a picket line in front of a federal building in New York City. Some held signs with “this man is not our boss” written in red over a sketch of Musk’s face. More than 150 people rallied with picket signs chanting “Move, DOGE, get out the way,” to the tune of a Ludacris song , and “What do we do when clean land/air/water/science is under attack? Stand up, fight back!” The workers, represented by union AFGE Council 238, held marches in 8 cities as part of a ‘National Day of Action.’ Plans to dismantle much of the agency and weaken protections against pollution put Americans at risk, EPA workers warn. “I work on enforcing regulations that deal with hazardous waste and toxic substances, which is work that I feel is not a partisan issue.” “I work on enforcing regulations that deal with hazardous waste and toxic substances, which is work that I feel is not a partisan issue,” says Suzanne Englot, an attorney who works in enforcement at the EPA. “Everyone wants to make sure that hazardous waste and toxic substances are properly regulated, disposed of, stored and all of that. But in these times, it makes me nervous that things are going to change.” The EPA, under Trump’s executive orders, is now barred from taking any enforcement or compliance actions that would “shut down any stage of energy production” unless there’s an “imminent and substantial” health threat, according to a memo that EPA leadership issued on March 12th . On the same day, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced what he called “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen,” proposing rollbacks on dozens of rules meant to curb pollution from power plants, oil and gas refineries, chemical plants, cars and trucks, factories, and more. The Trump administration has also moved to shutter the agency’s scientific research office and environmental justice offices . Trump has mused about cutting the EPA’s budget by 65 percent . Around 1,100 probationary employees at the EPA received notice in January telling them the agency “has the right to immediately terminate you.” A federal judge later ordered the Trump administration to rehire hundreds of workers who had been laid off at the agency. And the White House faces more legal challenges over its dismantling of federal agencies and deregulation spree. Both Trump and billionaire-backer Musk complained about regulations slowing companies down during last year’s election season. “It costs much more to do things environmentally clean,” Trump said in an interview with Joe Rogan on October 25th. “We&#8217;ve got to have sensible spending. And we&#8217;ve got to have deregulation …. I&#8217;m pro-environment, [but] I don&#8217;t think we should vilify the oil and gas industry because they&#8217;re keeping civilization going right now,” Musk said in his X interview with Trump on August 12th . Musk later wielded a chainsaw “ for bureaucracy &#8221; at the Conservative Political Action Conference stage last month .&nbsp;&nbsp; “Elon is perpetuating a climate of fear and targeting federal workers and the mission that they carry out to protect human health and the environment,” EPA environmental engineer Harper Stanfield told The Verge at the rally in New York City. “We can&#8217;t let EPA be silenced by billionaires.” Trump has accepted tens of millions of dollars in funding from the oil and gas industry. Elon Musk spent more than $250 million helping Trump get elected . The president then handed Musk the power to dramatically makeover federal agencies through his post leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).&nbsp; In an email to The Verge , the EPA said that it’s “listening” to employees and made cuts to comply with Trump’s agenda to eliminate programs it considers diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Stanfield and Englot said at the rally today that they’re calling on Congress to act as a check on the executive branch, and asking people to reach out to their elected representatives to support the EPA’s work.&nbsp; “Democrat, Republican, independent, whoever it is, everyone is impacted by this,” Englot says. “EPA’s work touches everyone&#8217;s lives.”",

    "description": "Game Informer is back, and so is its entire staff. On Tuesday, editor-in-chief Matt Miller announced that Gunzilla Games has acquired the rights to the gaming magazine, helping to bring the site and its archives back online. GameStop, which previously owned Game Informer , shut down the beloved magazine last August and laid off its entire staff after a more than 30-year run. The team teased a comeback last week , and has already published a series of new reviews for titles released during the magazine’s hiatus, along with a belated list of the best games of 2024 . Its new owners, Gunzilla Games, is a game developer based in Europe that’s currently working on a battle royale title called Off the Grid . Miller says the magazine will continue operating as an independent editorial outlet under a new entity called Game Informer, Inc. “Our intent is to continue to focus on highlighting the coolest games, celebrating the history and legacy of the gaming industry, and shining a spotlight on the creators and players who are charting its future,” Miller says. In addition to bringing back its website, Game Informer plans to resurrect its print magazine, too, with “new membership and subscription benefits.” Though Game Informer currently isn’t offering a subscription just yet, you can sign up for an account on its website to receive updates, as well as gain access to the magazine’s archive. Game Informer will continue updating its site with news, reviews, previews, features, event coverage, and more starting today.",

    "description": "AT&amp;T will cut its autopay and paperless billing discounts in half starting April 24th. In a statement to The Verge , AT&amp;T spokesperson Kyle Loomis confirmed reports that customers enrolled in the program will get $5 off their monthly bill instead of $10 when paying with a debit card. AT&amp;T is also doing away with the existing $5 discount for paperless and autopay customers with a linked credit card. The discount will now only apply to customers who have an AT&amp;T Plus Card from Citi. AT&amp;T will continue to offer a $10 discount to customers who use their bank accounts for autopay. Loomis said AT&amp;T is making the change to “align with others in the industry.” It doesn’t exactly come as a surprise, as T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;T have all already lowered autopay discounts for customers paying their bills with a credit card, while Verizon halved discounts for more people last year.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/tech/635652/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-deal-big-spring-sale-2025",
    "description": "The Colorsoft is like a souped-up Kindle Paperwhite, but that isn’t such a bad thing. When we reviewed the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition late last year, one of our biggest gripes was the e-reader’s initial starting price of $279.99. It’s a high price to pay for an ebook reader, particularly given its smaller 7-inch display and lack of stylus support, but those shortcomings are more forgivable now that the ebook reader is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $224.99 ($55 off). At its core, the Colorsoft is really just a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition with a color screen. It’s the first Kindle to utilize E Ink’s color screen technology, which provides more vibrancy than Kobo’s like-minded Libra Colour — even if the 300ppi resolution is halved in color mode. The resulting contrast and color make browsing and reading books (or comics!) more pleasant and engaging, but don’t expect the kind of glossy, high-res images you might get on a dedicated tablet with an OLED or LCD display. That said, the Colorsoft benefits from all the upgrades you’ll find on Amazon’s newer Kindles , as well as a slew of recent software updates. It features an auto-adjusting front light, robust IPX8 waterproofing, and faster page-turning performance than prior models. You’ll also get up to two months of battery life and wireless charging, not to mention a healthy 32GB of storage and zero ads. It’s the e-reader to get if you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon. In fact, it’s the only one.",

    "title": "Waymo plans robotaxi launch in Washington, DC in 2026",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/634955/waymo-washington-dc-robotaxi-launch-2026",
    "description": "Waymo announced that Washington, DC will be its next robotaxi city. The company aims to launch its Waymo One ridehailing service in the nation’s capitol in 2026 — though it acknowledged that it will first need to change the city law prohibiting fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers.&nbsp; Currently, companies that want to test autonomous vehicles in DC are required to have a human driver behind the steering wheel in case something goes wrong. Tech advocates have been pressing the city council to loosen the restrictions to allow fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. A spokesperson for the DC transportation department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Alphabet-owned company’s manually driven vehicles have been spotted around DC since last year . A Waymo product manager told a local news outlet that the company was primarily focused on neighborhoods like Dupont Circle, Foggy Bottom, and Penn Quarter. Waymo has not commented on the size of its service area nor which neighborhoods it is targeting if it launches next year.&nbsp; The Alphabet-owned company’s manually driven vehicles have been spotted around DC since last year. Launching a robotaxi service in the heart of the federal government is a risky move. The feds have largely taken a back seat in regulating autonomous vehicles, leaving it to the states to develop their own rulebooks for safe deployment. Legislation that would dramatically increase the number of AVs on the road has been stalled in Congress for over seven years , with lawmakers at odds over a range of issues, including safety, liability, and the right number of exemptions from federal motor vehicle safety standards.&nbsp; But beyond that, DC is its own city with its own transportation challenges. It has some of the worst traffic congestion in the US thanks to an ever-expanding population and stagnate infrastructure. Waymo hasn’t said how many vehicles it intends to bring to DC.&nbsp; Waymo currently operates its driverless ridehailing vehicles in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. It recently launched a partnership with Uber in Austin, and it plans to expand that deal to Atlanta later this year. It also plans to operate robotaxis in Silicon Valley and Miami.&nbsp; In DC, customers will use the company’s ridehail app, Waymo One, to summon driverless vehicles. Waymo currently provides 200,000 passenger trips a week using the app.&nbsp; DC has seen some autonomous testing before. Cruise, General Motors’ now-defunct AV subsidiary, tested several of its vehicles there . Another defunct company, Ford-backed Argo AI, has also previously tested autonomous vehicles in the district .&nbsp; Waymo markets itself as a safer option than human-driven vehicles. The company has released insurance data that shows its vehicles cause less property damage and fewer bodily injuries when they crash than human drivers. Update March 25th 3:28pm ET: A spokesperson for the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) sent the following statement: &#8220;The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) is aware of Waymo&#8217;s announcement. DDOT is actively developing a permitting framework to support the safe and responsible testing of autonomous vehicles in Washington, DC. Current law requires an operator behind the wheel and does not allow driverless commercial operations. DDOT is engaged in an iterative rulemaking process with our agency partners, including the Department of For-Hire Vehicles, to refine our approach based on public input, emerging best practices, and lessons learned from peer jurisdictions. Our priority remains ensuring that any company operating in the District—such as Waymo—does so in a manner that prioritizes safety, aligns with our regulatory framework, and integrates seamlessly into DC’s unique transportation ecosystem.&#8221;",

    "description": "AI 技术对电力的狂热需求可以上溯到 2012 年的 AlexNet。当时多伦多大学的 AI 研究员 Alex Krizhevsky、 Ilya Sutskever 和 Geoffrey E. Hinton 正在为图像识别竞赛 ImageNet LSRVC 开发一种卷积神经网络。在当时图像识别是非常有挑战性的。研究人员认为他们需要一个庞大的神经网络，该网络以首席研究员的名字命名为 AlexNet，它有超过 6000 万参数和 65 万个神经元。但一大问题是如此大的神经网络如何进行训练？他们的实验室里有几张英伟达 GTX 580 显卡，每张配备了 3GB 显存，但 AlexNet 太大没办法加载到单张显卡上。研究人员设法将训练阶段划分到两张并行工作的 GPU 上——一半神经元在一张 GPU 上，另一半在另一张上运行。AlexNet 以压倒性优势赢得了 2012 年的比赛，从此 AI 模型的规模不再受限于单张显卡了，而妖精也从瓶子里释放了出来。在 AlexNet 之后，越来越强大的 AI 模型需要成千上万张 GPU。根据 Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)的报告，2010 年到 2020 年间数据中心的功耗相对平稳，原因是英伟达数据中心 GPU 的功耗同期提升了大约 15 倍，因此能保持数据中心功耗的稳定。到了 2022 年基于 transformer 的大模型的出现推动了数据中心功耗的大幅提升。大模型需要处理数百亿甚至数千亿个神经元，训练之后的推理阶段还需要处理大量数据。Open AI 在训练新模型时使用了超过 25,000 张英伟达 Ampere 100 GPU，持续了 100 天，耗电量 50 GW 时，足以满足一个中型城镇一年的电力需求。根据 Google 的数据，训练占 AI 模型生命周期总耗电量的四成，剩下的六成是推理。功耗的飙升促使科学家思考如何在不牺牲性能的情况下减少内存和计算要求。研究人员尝试了模型剪枝、量化等优化方法。",

    "description": "标准宇宙模型「ΛCDM（Lambda-Cold Dark Matter，宇宙常数–冷暗物质模型）」是现代宇宙学的主流理论架构，成功解释了宇宙中大尺度结构的形成与演化。根据该模型，宇宙中仅有约 5% 的物质为的普通物质，其余则由暗物质（约25%）与暗能量（约70%）构成。暗能量被视为驱动宇宙加速膨胀的来源，并假设其能量密度随时间保持不变，也就是所谓的「宇宙常数（Λ）」。然而两项最新的大型国际合作计划，暗能量光谱仪（DESI）与暗能量调查（DES），其研究开始挑战这项假设，指出暗能量可能会随时间演化，进而动摇我们对宇宙膨胀的基本认识。根据 DESI 本身的资料分析，初步结果与标准宇宙模型 ΛCDM 基本一致。然而，当研究团队将这些观测结果进一步与宇宙微波背景辐射、超新星与弱重力透镜等其他观测资料结合时，发现暗能量的影响力可能随时间减弱，显示宇宙学常数可能并非真正的「常数」。目前的统计偏离程度为 2.8 至 4.2 个标准差，虽尚未达到物理学界公认的 5 个标准差门槛，但足以引起学术界的高度关注与讨论。",

    "description": "ChatGPT has a new image generator feature that can create images from users&#39; text prompts. Jaque Silva/NurPhoto ChatGPT released an image generator on Tuesday. A software engineer on X said they discovered that the feature had trouble creating images of &#34;sexy women.&#34; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it was a &#34;bug&#34; that will be fixed. ChatGPT&#39;s new image generator appeared to have a bug that only allowed the AI tool to create images of &#34;sexy men.&#34; An X user who identified themself as a software engineer pointed out the issue on Tuesday, shortly after the feature was unveiled. The image generator is a new function of ChatGPT that allows users to create elaborate images from detailed prompts. &#34;New ChatGPT image gen can draw sexy men but not sexy women,&#34; the user wrote, posting a screenshot of ChatGPT&#39;s response, which said, &#34;The difference comes down to context and how content is interpreted in terms of sexualization and objectification, especially when it involves women.&#34; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded that image generation of sexy women &#34;should be allowed&#34; and that it was a &#34;bug&#34; that will be fixed. &#34;Hot guy though!&#34; Altman added. ChatGPT appeared to have no issues generating an image of a &#34;hot woman&#34; when prompted by Business Insider. ChatGPT can now create images of humans through detailed prompts. Screenshot of ChatGPT The image generator does have restrictions around creating images of real people . When Business Insider continued the prompt requesting an image of Sam Altman, ChatGPT responded that it couldn&#39;t generate an exact image of the CEO but could instead create a &#34;character inspired by his features with a unique, artistic twist.&#34; ChatGPT&#39;s new image generator has content restrictions regarding generating images of real people. Screenshot of ChatGPT OpenAI said in its announcement of the feature that there are &#34;heightened restrictions&#34; on requests for images of real people, especially when they involve nudity or graphic violence. In an addendum explaining the new feature, the company said it won&#39;t outright block the capability of generating images of adult public figures. This allows for the &#34;possibility of helpful and beneficial uses in areas like educational, historical, satirical and political speech,&#34; OpenAI said. Public figures can, however, opt their image out of this feature, the company said. An OpenAI spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-war-big-law-targets-jenner-block-firm-resists-2025-3",
    "description": "Donald Trump on Tuesday signed his latest executive order targeting a Big Law firm, this time taking aim at Jenner &amp; Block. Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images Donald Trump on Tuesday signed his latest executive order targeting a Big Law firm, Jenner &amp; Block. The order is similar to one against Perkins Coie, which a federal judge blocked as unconstitutional. Jenner &amp; Block, in a statement, said the firm remains focused on serving its clients despite the order. Jenner &amp; Block on Tuesday became the latest target in President Donald Trump&#39;s war on Big Law after he issued an executive order revoking its attorneys&#39; security clearances and ordering a review of the firm&#39;s government contracts. But Jenner signaled it doesn&#39;t plan to back down without a fight. The firm, headquartered in Chicago, employs over 400 attorneys across six offices nationwide and is the fourth major law firm targeted by the Trump administration with similar executive actions. Each of the firms &mdash;&nbsp; Paul Weiss , Perkins Coie, and Covington &amp; Burling &mdash; has had ties to Trump&#39;s political opponents. In the Tuesday order, Trump specifically singled out attorney Andrew Weissmann, a Jenner employee who served as a lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller&#39;s Special Counsel&#39;s Office, which investigated Trump&#39;s ties to Russia in 2016. The order described Weissmann&#39;s career as &#34;rooted in weaponized government and abuse of power.&#34; &#34;Jenner &amp; Block has had a long history representing clients, paid and pro bono, in their most difficult matters since 1914,&#34; Jenner &amp; Block said in a statement released after the order was issued. &#34;Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court. We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients&#39; interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.&#34; US District Judge Beryl Howell on March 12 partially blocked Trump&#39;s order against Perkins Coie. Politico reported that during an emergency hearing, the judge said that the &#34;retaliatory animus&#34; of Trump&#39;s order against the firm was &#34;clear on its face&#34; and &#34;runs head-on into the wall of First Amendment protections.&#34; On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion to disqualify Howell from overseeing the lawsuit, arguing the judge is &#34;insufficiently impartial&#34; to rule on the case. While Perkins Coie fights the executive order in court, another targeted firm has taken a contrasting approach to handling Trump&#39;s actions against it. Instead of challenging the order&#39;s legality, Paul Weiss agreed to reevaluate its hiring practices in alignment with Trump&#39;s anti-DEI initiatives and provide $40 million in pro bono legal work to further causes identified by the Trump administration, such as combating antisemitism and assisting veterans. Trump rescinded the order against Paul Weiss after the agreement was struck, though Business Insider previously reported the language in Paul Weiss&#39; copy of the agreement did not include references to DEI that were in Trump&#39;s announcement. Rachel Cohen , a now-former associate from the high-profile firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP, last Friday publicly resigned over what she said was her firm&#39;s resistance to challenging the president&#39;s orders. Also on Friday, the president sent a&nbsp; memo to Attorney General Pam Bondi &nbsp;ordering her to identify &#34;frivolous&#34; lawsuits against his administration and flag the law firms associated with the cases so they can be targeted for punitive actions like those levied against Paul Weiss and Perkins Coie. In an email to his staff on Sunday, Paul Weiss Chairman Brad Karp called Trump&#39;s order &#34;unprecedented&#34; in the firm&#39;s 150-year history and an &#34;existential threat.&#34; &#34;The executive order could easily have destroyed our firm,&#34; Karp wrote. &#34;It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients.&#34; The assault on Big Law &mdash;&nbsp;and each firm&#39;s disparate handling of the orders against them &mdash;&nbsp;has made waves across the legal industry, with legal scholars warning Business Insider the unprecedented attacks from the sitting president are a threat to the rule of law that have implications far beyond damaging the businesses of the targeted firms. &#34;Something like this has never happened, or maybe hasn&#39;t happened since the time of Andrew Jackson. I mean, this is really a kind of a constitutional crisis,&#34; Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, previously told BI. &#34;I think our legal system is under attack, and it&#39;s a question of who&#39;s going to step up and defend it.&#34; Have a tip?

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/f47-ngad-6th-generation-stealth-fighter-jet-concept-2025-3",
    "description": "An artist rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter, the F-47. US Air Force Boeing won the $20 billion contract to develop the Air Force&#39;s sixth-gen stealth fighter, the F-47 . The designation is a nod to the P-47 fighter, the USAF&#39;s founding year, and the 47th president. See the competing NGAD fighter designs proposed by Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. Boeing will develop the US Air Force&#39;s highly anticipated sixth-generation stealth fighter, poised to replace the F-22 Raptor and play a leading role in the Air Force&#39;s future fleet. The sixth-generation combat aircraft is a central component of the Air Force&#39;s secretive and costly Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) , which seeks to fly the future fighter, designated the F-47, alongside autonomous drone wingmen known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). Though never officially confirmed, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman competed for the $20 billion contract. Northrop Grumman dropped out of the running in 2023, leaving Boeing to battle it out with Lockheed Martin&#39;s dominance of the stealth fighter force. Boeing&#39;s successful bid An artist rendering shows an early version of Boeing&#39;s proposed design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation stealth fighter. Boeing President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing was selected to develop the future combat aircraft, which will be designated the F-47. The designation is a deviation from typical naming conventions because it was previously used for the World War II-era fighter, the P-47. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said the designation is a nod to the P-47 escort fighter of World War II, as well as the Air Force&#39;s founding year in 1947 and the &#34;pivotal&#34; support of the 47th US President Donald Trump in developing the aircraft. Winning the $20 billion NGAD contract will serve as a much-needed boost not only to its waning defense unit but also to recoup losses from the KC-46 tanker and new Air Force One aircraft . Steve Parker, interim president, and chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said the company made &#34;the most significant investment in the history of our defense business&#34; after being tasked with designing, building, and delivering the sixth-generation fighter to the Air Force. &#34;We are ready to provide the most advanced and innovative NGAD aircraft needed to support the mission,&#34; Parker said in a statement. The US Air Force&#39;s next-gen stealth plane An early concept art rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter. US Air Force The pursuit for America&#39;s next-generation platforms began over a decade ago in the early 2010s. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched a study in 2014 to explore strategies to maintain the US&#39; edge in air superiority. It found that simply developing sixth-generation combat aircraft wouldn&#39;t be enough to ensure air superiority against US adversaries, instead urging a &#34;family of systems&#34; across multiple domains, including air, space, and cyberspace. Air superiority is the condition where a nation&#39;s aircraft can fly at minimal risk from other aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. The US&#39;s longtime edge in achieving this is increasingly threatened by the proliferation of air defense missiles and China&#39;s aircraft build-up , including two types of stealth fighters. Building upon DARPA&#39;s findings, the Air Force launched its own study, Air Superiority 2030, which laid the groundwork for its NGAD program, which envisioned creating a future hybrid fleet of crewed and uncrewed aerial systems. As one of the Air Force&#39;s most sensitive and highly classified programs, few details were publicly known about the NGAD program. In September 2020, Will Roper, then-Air Force acquisition chief, officially confirmed that the service had test-flown a prototype of its next-gen fighter . This was the first public acknowledgment of the top-secret program that he said he hoped would garner &#34;greater credibility&#34; on the program&#39;s progress. By 2023, Boeing, Lockheed Martin , and Northrop Grumman appeared to be in the running to develop the NGAD platform, floating potential designs for it in promotional materials for their future projects &mdash; a common practice among US military aircraft manufacturers. Northrop Grumman &mdash; the lead contractor for the B-2 Spirit and B-21 Raider stealth bombers &mdash; was also in the running to build the NGAD aircraft but dropped out of consideration as the prime developer in 2023, instead intending to support other bids as a supplier. Early concept designs A video promoting Boeing Phantom Works&#39; upcoming projects appears to show a concept rendering of the next-generation platform. Boeing Defense/X Art renderings of the NGAD fighter show little more than the jet&#39;s sleek exterior and wings, revealing few details about the aircraft&#39;s final design. But concept designs released by the three competing legacy combat aircraft contractors could give an idea of what the F-47 could look like when it takes to the skies. In a promotional video released by Boeing Phantom Works in 2023, a brief rendering of a 3D model stealth plane showed assembling mid-flight to showcase the digital design capabilities to streamline the development of innovative aircraft. The hypothetical stealth aircraft appears to feature a flat, tailless cranked wing design with two engines. A fighter jet upset An art rendering shows Lockheed Martin&#39;s proposed design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation stealth fighter. Lockheed Martin Before Boeing was selected to build the F-47, Lockheed Martin had a monopoly on the Air Force&#39;s combat aircraft production , leading some to believe that it would be the prime contractor of the NGAD platform. Following the fighter jet upset, Boeing&#39;s share price jumped 3% to $5.28 a share on Friday, adding $4 billion in market value. Meanwhile, Lockheed&#39;s stock dropped about 5.4% to $27.04 a share, an estimated $6 billion loss in market value. &#34;While disappointed with this outcome, we are confident we delivered a competitive solution,&#34; Lockheed Martin said in a statement. Boeing has long been a major player in the military aerospace sector, including developing the F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets and the KC-46 aerial tanker . However, unlike competitors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which secured domestic contracts for the F-22 Raptor and B-2 Spirit stealth aircraft respectively, Boeing&#39;s long-term defense production largely relies on foreign acquisition and international defense sales. Boeing and Lockheed previously faced off to develop the fifth-generation multirole fighter as part of the Pentagon&#39;s Joint Strike Fighter program. Lockheed&#39;s X-35 beat out Boeing&#39;s X-32, entering production as the F-35 Lightning II . Lockheed&#39;s NGAD design Lockheed Martin posted an aircraft outline that appeared to resemble an NGAD-like platform on its Instagram story. Lockheed Martin/Instagram Lockheed&#39;s hint at its potential NGAD concept proposal was a lot more subtle. In 2023, Lockheed&#39;s Skunk Works division posted a black-and-white aircraft outline on its Instagram to celebrate its 80th anniversary. Despite the lack of details in the cryptic post, the planform appears to resemble a tactical aircraft design, likely related to the Air Force&#39;s NGAD program. Lockheed further pointed to its potential future participation in the NGAD by releasing another promotional video later that year, seemingly referring to the Air Force&#39;s pursuit of a hybrid fleet. The video features crewed and uncrewed systems flying in formation, with Lockheed&#39;s F-35 surrounded by futuristic UAVs. Northrop Grumman withdraws NGAD bid A 2021 video released by Northrop Grumman featured concept renderings of its future aircraft projects, including what appears to be a next-generation fighter jet. Northrop Grumman/YouTube Northrop Grumman was also competing to be the prime contractor behind the Air Force&#39;s NGAD aircraft. The company hinted at its interest in participating in the NGAD program in a 2021 promotional video that appeared to include a tailless stealth fighter in a hangar with historic and futuristic aircraft. But Northrop Grumman&#39;s bid to build the NGAD fighter was cut short after it pulled out of consideration in 2023, CEO Kathy Warden announced. Warden added that the company was &#34;responding to other bidders&#39; request for proposal as the supplier, that&#39;s particularly in our mission system portfolio.&#34; Navy&#39;s next-gen fighter up for grabs An artist rendering shows an early version of Northrop Grumman&#39;s design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter. Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman was selected to build the B-21 Raider, the Air Force&#39;s first sixth-generation stealth bomber, as part of the service&#39;s Long Range Strike Bomber program. The company unveiled the stealth bomber in late 2022, and the aircraft took its maiden flight in November 2023. Northrop Grumman is still in the running against Boeing to develop the Navy&#39;s next-generation fighter, the F/A-XX, which aims to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Steep ambitions, steep price tag An artist rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter, the F-47. US Air Force The NGAD&#39;s steep ambitions to revolutionize the US&nbsp; air superiority mission &nbsp;come with an equally steep price tag. In 2018, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the NGAD airframe alone could cost up to $300 million each. Then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in 2023 that he anticipated the unit cost to be &#34;too expensive to be purchased in large numbers,&#34; revealing the service&#39;s plan to team each NGAD with two CCAs. From 2022 to 2024, Congress allocated $5.1 billion to develop NGAD-related technologies, which included a &#34;strategic pause&#34; in the program due to high project costs. In 2025, the Biden administration requested $2.75 billion to build an NGAD platform, which could skyrocket to an estimated $5.72 billion by 2029. &#39;China is a threat today&#39; An F-22 flies over Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. US Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Paige Weldon Kendall emphasized the pressing need for the NGAD &#34; family of systems &#34; amid evolving threats by US adversaries, especially after the Pentagon truncated the procurement of F-22 jets from 750 to 187 in 2009. &#34;NGAD will include attributes such as enhanced lethality and the ability to survive, persist, interoperate, and adapt in the air domain, all within highly contested operational environments,&#34; Kendall said in May 2023. &#34;No one does this better than the US Air Force , but we will lose that edge if we don&#39;t move forward now.&#34; The urgency is also spurred in part by China&#39;s increasingly sophisticated long-range air defense and electronic warfare systems as China-Taiwan tensions contribute to growing militarization in the Indo-Pacific. The F-47 is expected to operate closely with two new uncrewed fighters , so-called &#34;loyal wingmen&#34; that are capable of flying missions too dangerous for a pilot in the cockpit. In a potential war scenario with China , defense analysts argued the F-22&#39;s limited range and payload capacity would be ill-suited for the terrain, consisting of islands spread hundreds of miles apart, leaving the fleet vulnerable to attack during refueling efforts. &#34;China is not a future threat; China is a threat today,&#34; Kendall said during a 2024 keynote address. &#34;I am not saying war in the Pacific is imminent or inevitable. It is not,&#34; he added. &#34;But I am saying that the likelihood is increasing and will continue to do so.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Veterans are roasting top Trump officials over their Signal group chat",

    "description": "US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was one of the top officials who used the Signal app to discuss airstrikes in an apparent breach of security protocol. ALEX WROBLEWSKI/AFP via Getty Images Military social media is buzzing with memes about officials&#39; use (or misuse) of Signal . Trump officials mistakenly added a journalist to a Signal chat on military operations. The Pentagon recently warned against using Signal due to hacking concerns. Is the cure to male loneliness… starting a group text to bomb the Houthis ? That&#39;s one of the sarcastic questions posed in memes blowing up across military-focused social media after top Trump officials used Signal to discuss airstrikes against Yemen&#39;s Houthi militants &mdash; an operational security violation, or OPSEC, almost certain to be career-ending or worse for a rank-and-file soldier. Vice President JD Vance , Trump&#39;s national security advisor Mike Waltz, and other top officials debated whether to strike Yemen in a group chat that mistakenly included Jeffery Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, who reported on the chaotic exchange. Goldberg reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared an attack plan, including the names of those being targeted, before the airstrikes on the encrypted app &mdash; raising concerns this practice could spoil the operation or endanger troops. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kyle Eberly (@sitreps2steercos) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that &#34;there was no classified information as I understand it,&#34; and Waltz added, &#34;We have our legal teams looking at it.&#34; Signal has been widely used for years throughout lower military levels for communication. But even junior troops with access to top-secret materials, which could include pending missile strikes, have long known that communicating such sensitive details should only be done via government-provided secure lines, like SIPR (secure internet protocol router) email or phone, making the message exchange an intelligence gaffe of preposterous proportions. The founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, mocked the spillage . &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations,&#34; he wrote in a post on X Monday. Likely because of Signal&#39;s popularity, the Pentagon released new guidance last week discouraging the app&#39;s use even for everyday communications, NPR reported Tuesday . According to the memo NPR cites, &#34;Russian professional hacking groups are employing the &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations,&#34; the guidance read. &#34;The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information.&#34; The memo was dated March 18, one week after the baffling Houthi chat began. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kyle Eberly (@sitreps2steercos) Memes circulating online poke fun at Hegseth, Vance, Waltz, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard , all military veterans who presumably had to undergo annual cyber awareness while serving. Many memes and users pondered whether the entire military would be required to brush up on OPSEC (operational security) classes and ask if the adage &#34;different spanks for different ranks,&#34; will continue to hold true. Former CIA operations officer John Sipher called the move &#34;worse tha[n] amateur&#34; in a post on BlueSky. &#34;It 100% provides Moscow information on US capabilities and personalities. Information they can use down the line or share with Iran &mdash; the Houthi enablers. It may provide ongoing access to some participants.&#34; Okay this one is my favorite Signal gate meme [image or embed] &mdash; ex-Lethality Jane ( @lethalityjane.bsky.social ) March 25, 2025 at 2:04 PM &#34;Member when all we had to worry about was some S2 dork bringing his cellphone into the scif?&#34; asked one commenter, referring to personnel in ultra-secure areas known as sensitive compartmented information facilities. &#34;Pepperidge farms remembers.&#34; &#34;Text STOP to unsubscribe from war plan updates,&#34; read another. &#34;Somewhere a US Army counterintelligence agent is having a minor breakdown over how he has a perfect new case study for his annual OPSEC brief but he won&#39;t be able to use it for at least four years,&#34; read yet another BlueSky post.

    "title": "Chinese brands are racking up record safety warnings in the US",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-ecommerce-brands-record-safety-warnings-us-consumer-watchdog-2025-3",
    "description": "Two-thirds of the products that received consumer safety warnings in 2024 came to the US from Chinese companies, according to the Public Interest Research Group. Associated Press US consumer safety watchdogs are issuing a rapidly growing number of product warnings. Warnings are issued when companies don&#39;t voluntarily comply with recalls for products deemed hazardous. A US official told the Public Interest Research Group the surge boils down to one word: China. The explosion of international e-commerce brands is leading to a sharp rise in product safety warnings. Warnings issued by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission reached a record high of 63 last year, according to a new analysis from the Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission issues warnings when companies don&#39;t voluntarily comply with recalls for hazardous it deems hazardous. Last year&#39;s figure is up dramatically from 38 in 2023 and 12 in 2022, according to the PIRG analysis. There were fewer than 10 warnings combined from 2015 to 2021, it added. So, what&#39;s contributing to the rise? &#34;In a word, China,&#34; acting CPSC&#39;s chairman, Peter Feldman, told PIRG. Two-thirds of the products that received warnings in 2024 came to the US from Chinese companies, the PIRG report found. &#34;The United States is facing a flood of Chinese consumer products that violate US safety laws,&#34; Feldman said. &#34;When CPSC identifies illegal Chinese goods, the manufacturer is, more often than not, unreachable, unfindable, or uncooperative.&#34; In other words, a warning is an indication that safety officials are not able to make progress with a company concerning a recall. Some of the hazardous products included a foldable step stool that could collapse or tip over, a line of e-bike batteries prone to overheating or catching fire, infant loungers that posed a risk of suffocation or entrapment, and bike helmets that didn&#39;t meet US safety standards. Many of the products that received warnings were sold by third parties on Amazon&#39;s and Walmart&#39;s marketplaces. In at least one instance each, both retailers agreed to contact customers about affected products. An Amazon spokesperson told BI that all products offered on its site are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The company also notifies customers of product updates through a dedicated page in page in their Amazon accounts called &#34;Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts.&#34; The PIRG analysis also found two items with warnings that were sold on Shein&#39;s website. Among the recalled products, the report found that those sold exclusively online were twice as likely to violate a US safety standard than those sold in physical stores. Interestingly, while eight products were recalled that were exclusively sold on Temu, the PIRG report also noted that no Temu items received warnings last year because all companies involved cooperated with the recall procedure.

    "description": "Ben Affleck at the world premiere of &#34;The Accountant 2&#34; at SXSW. Marcus Ingram / Getty Images Ben Affleck told GQ that he made his Hollywood career a 9-to-5 job to spend more time with his children. &#34;I was really missing time I could never get back,&#34; he said. Affleck shares three children with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner. Ben Affleck said he adapted his filmmaking career into a 9-to-5 job so that he could spend more time with his three teenage children. In a new GQ interview , Affleck said he realized that being present as a parent was important to him, so he wanted to avoid spending multiple days on sets away from his children. &#34;I was really missing time I could never get back. My kids were 8, 11, and 14, and I felt like: I don&#39;t want to miss any of this time at all,&#34; Affleck said. &#34;And so I thought, well, Let me figure out a way to work at home and have the kind of job where I can actually be here and build my schedule around that.&#34; Affleck co-parents three children with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner : Violet Anne Affleck, 19, Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck, 16, and Samuel Affleck, 13. Affleck told GQ he developed a better work-life balance while working at Artists Equity, a production company he co-founded with his longtime friend and collaborator Matt Damon and investing partner Gerry Cardinale. Since the company&#39;s founding in 2022, they have produced the critically acclaimed sports movie &#34; Air &#34; and the upcoming action sequel, &#34;The Accountant 2,&#34; among others. &#34;Part of what&#39;s great about this Artists Equity job, part of why I love it, is because I&#39;m in LA,&#34; Affleck said. &#34;When we&#39;re done at 2:30, I&#39;m going to go, and I&#39;ll be home at 3:45 when my kids get off the bus. And I&#39;m able to construct a life that does that. And that means more to me than any of it. That makes me happier.&#34; Matt Damon and Ben Affleck at SXSW festival to promote Artists Equity&#39;s latest film, &#34;The Accountant 2.&#34; Michael Buckner/SXSW Conference &amp; Festivals via Getty Images Affleck also told GQ that he now avoids directing more films because they can be time-consuming. &#34;The one regret I have about all the movies that I&#39;ve directed is the amount of time it&#39;s taken me away from my kids,&#34; he said. &#34;I love making art. I loved making &#39;The Town . &#39; But I was away from my kids for long periods of time. There&#39;s little chunks that I missed, and that doesn&#39;t feel good.&#34; Other celebrities, such as Kieran Culkin and Eva Mendes , have also opened up about how they balance their careers with raising children. Mendes told the &#34; Today &#34; show in 2024 that she took a hiatus from acting to pursue other projects, like writing a children&#39;s book and raising her two children with Ryan Gosling . &#34;I still work. I just didn&#39;t act because acting takes you on locations. It takes you away,&#34; Mendes said. Meanwhile, Culkin, who won his first Oscar earlier this month, told the Guardian in 2024 that he has a rule to not spend more than 8 days on set away from his children.

    "title": "Trump wants DOGE to look at voter rolls",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-doge-voter-rolls-executive-order-2025-3",
    "description": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly made false claims about elections. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images President Donald Trump wants DOGE to look at voter rolls. According to an executive order, the DOGE office would help review public voter information. No federal official has the power to remove a person from state rolls. President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered the DOGE office to assist in reviewing publicly available voter rolls. In a lengthy executive order, Trump asked the Department of Homeland Security to work with DOGE administrator Amy Gleason &#34;to review each State&#39;s publicly available voter registration list and available records concerning voter list maintenance activities.&#34; It&#39;s unclear the extent to which DOGE would use the data. No federal official has the power to remove someone from the voter rolls. &#34;DOGE certainly has no power to kick people off rolls,&#34; Rick Hasen, an election law expert and a law professor at UCLA, told Business Insider. &#34;But they could make a lot of noise trying to claim they&#39;ve found fraud when they find that voter registration rolls are not being kept up to date.&#34; The White House has repeatedly said Gleason leads the DOGE office. She recently declared in court that Elon Musk does not work for the rebranded US DOGE Service. But Musk is the de facto leader of DOGE, a point underscored by his appearance on Fox News Tuesday night with members of the DOGE team. Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the DOGE office&#39;s efforts to obtain sensitive and nonpublic federal data. Unlike social security data, many states make their voter lists publicly available, often for a fee. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group that monitors state-level legislation, some states restrict access to their information. Trump has repeatedly falsely claimed that he won the 2020 election. After his 2016 victory, he repeatedly claimed without evidence that fraud prevented him from winning the popular vote. In the lead-up to the 2024 race, Republicans raised concerns about non-citizens voting in the presidential race, an occurrence that remains rare and illegal. Recent audits of voter rolls have found extremely few numbers of noncitizens registered to vote. Georgia found 20 noncitizens registered to vote out of more than 8 million registered voters in the state. During the first Trump administration, 44 states opposed a Trump election commission&#39;s sweeping request for voter information, according to a 2017 CNN report. At the time, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, vice chair of the commission, had said the data would eventually be made public. Hasen told Business Insider said Tuesday&#39;s EO could spark such a confrontation again. &#34;We will see what happens this time,&#34; he said. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "What is Signal? How the popular encrypted messaging app keeps your texts private",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-signal-app",
    "description": "Signal is an encrypted messaging app. Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Signal is a messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption to keep your messages private. When you send a message on Signal, the only people who can see it are the recipients. You can use the Signal app to send texts, photos, videos, and voice messages. Over the last few years, Signal has become one of the most popular messaging apps. Favored by tech giants, cybersecurity experts, journalists, government officials, and many more, Signal has gone from a darling secret of the security community to a group chatting phenomenon. It&#39;s recently been thrust into the spotlight after the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat where top Trump administration officials discussed bombing Yemen. According to Goldberg, Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard , and Secretary of State Marco Rubio all appeared to be members of the group chat, which was called &#34;Houthi PC small group,&#34; referring to the principals committee. Signal founder and former CEO Matthew Rosenfeld, who goes by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike, poked fun at the botched chat in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. &#34;There are so many great reasons to be on Signal,&#34; he wrote. &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations.&#34; Elon Musk has also endorsed Signal before, writing simply in a post on X in 2021, &#34;Use Signal.&#34; He changed his mind about the app a few years later, though, writing in May 2024 that it had &#34;known vulnerabilities.&#34; Signal&#39;s president, Meredith Whittaker , later told Wired she went two nights without sleeping &#34;just dealing with Twitter stuff.&#34; &#34;He&#39;s been a fan. So I don&#39;t know what changed,&#34; she said. &#34;What I do know is that, as far as we know, the claim was completely baseless.&#34; Whittaker added there was no &#34;serious report&#34; backing up Musk&#39;s claims. Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up in 2018 by the app&#39;s cofounders, Rosenfeld and Brian Acton, who also cofounded WhatsApp . The foundation has five board members and serves to &#34;support Signal&#39;s growth and ongoing operations as well as investigate the future of private communication,&#34; according to its website . Here&#39;s a guide to the Signal app, including why it&#39;s become so popular. The Signal app, explained Signal is safer and more secure than most messengers because of a process called &#34; end-to-end encryption .&#34; This works by encoding a sender&#39;s message in such a way that only the intended receiver can view it. Neither Signal, nor your phone company, nor the government can read your messages. That&#39;s why it has remained popular. Signal lets you chat securely. Signal However, Signal&#39;s messages are only secure if both the sender and receiver are using the app. If you prefer to communicate through Signal, the app has a simple feature to invite someone to download it. It&#39;s also just as easy to block someone on Signal from contacting you. Encryption itself isn&#39;t a unique feature, as apps like iMessage, Telegram, and WeChat also offer it. But one of Signal&#39;s selling points is that its source code is also publicly available, so experts have been able to poke and prod at its defenses for years, strengthening it in the process. Signal&#39;s key features Signal is similar to other messaging apps but with more robust security features. It&#39;s available for free on iPhone, Android, Mac, and PC. Android users can even set their default messaging app to Signal if they want to. There&#39;s a Signal app on nearly every major system. Signal.org On a basic level, you can have one-on-one conversations with someone or start a group chat on Signal . In these chats, you can send pictures, videos, internet links, voice messages, and more. Signal&#39;s beta version has tested new kinds of chats with forum-like features, including group admins, updates, and timers for disappearing messages. For now, groups are capped at 1,000 people, but adding and removing people from a Signal group is simple. If you&#39;re concerned about someone accessing the app from your phone, you can lock the Signal app with the same passcode or fingerprint scan normally used to lock your phone. Signal requires a phone number to join the app. To keep yours private, you can sign up with a Google Voice number. Apple users will want to visit their privacy settings within the app and turn off &#34;Show Calls in Recents&#34; to prevent their history from syncing with the cloud. You can also set your messages to disappear over time, or set photos to disappear after a single viewing. Barbara Smith and Vivian McCall contributed to an earlier version of this story.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-olsen-movies-tv-shows-marvel-2025-3",
    "description": "Jake Giles Netter/Max; Magnolia Pictures; Marvel Studios; Chelsea Jia Feng/BI Elizabeth Olsen may be best known for starring in a billion-dollar franchise, but she still holds her indie roots close. Three years after her breakthrough in the 2011 indie film &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene,&#34; a Sundance darling that cost less than $1 million to make, Olsen would make her first in a decade&#39;s worth of appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch . She said taking the role was a smart &mdash; not to mention lucrative &mdash; decision. But while Olsen told Business Insider the storytelling possibilities are &#34;endless&#34; in the MCU, it&#39;s important she diversifies her work outside blockbusters. &#34;Those other choices you make are incredibly important because they say so much about what your passion is,&#34; Olsen said. That led her to her latest role in Fleur Fortuné&#39;s new dystopian sci-fi thriller , &#34;The Assessment.&#34; Olsen and Himesh Patel star as Mia and Aaryan, a couple who agree to undergo an emotionally grueling seven-day assessment to determine if they&#39;re fit to have children. Himesh Patel and Elizabeth Olsen in &#34;The Assessment.&#34; Magnolia Pictures Olsen was intrigued by the dystopian premise of &#34;The Assessment&#34; and the opportunity to work with Fortuné, whom she described as an incredible visual filmmaker. &#34;I loved the game and the rules of the game that these characters had to play together,&#34; Olsen said. &#34;I loved how contained something that took place in a near future time was. And I really love stories that play by their own rules.&#34; As an independent film, &#34;The Assessment&#34; offered a more intimate atmosphere, one that allowed Fortuné, Olsen, Patel, and their costar Alicia Vikander to become t heir own indie version of the Avengers: &#34;I really felt like we were our own little troupe.&#34; For the latest interview in Business Insider&#39;s Role Play series, Olsen reflects on auditioning for police procedurals, the best advice she ever got, and how starring in Marvel projects has bolstered her indie career. On auditioning for anything and everything early in her career Olsen in &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene.&#34; Fox Searchlight Business Insider: You have an affinity for playing characters who are going through a lot emotionally, going as far back as your film debut in &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene.&#34; What draws you to these heavier roles? Elizabeth Olsen: With &#34;Martha,&#34; I mean, I auditioned for everything around that time. I auditioned for &#34;Blue Bloods,&#34; I auditioned for &#34;CSI&#34; whatever it was, I auditioned for &#34;Law &amp; Order.&#34; I auditioned for all of the things and it just happened to be a job that I got. I would have said yes to any job because I just wanted to be a working actor. I just happened to be very lucky that it was a script that I was totally obsessed with and a character that I was really fighting for. I don&#39;t mean to put myself through any kind of extreme experience, but I do think the extremities of what it means to be a person in the world are more interesting to explore. The things that I&#39;m really drawn to right now are: What are prototypes or characters that we&#39;ve seen before, and then how can we subvert them in some way? At least on the job I&#39;m on right now, that&#39;s how I feel. You got to work with Spike Lee on the 2013 &#34;Oldboy&#34; remake. What was it like working with a famed director so early in your career? You could have told me to do anything with him, and I would have done it. I loved getting to work with him. He is also such a kind filmmaker. He&#39;s so kind to his crew. He&#39;s kind to his cast. He has such a boyishness to him and to get to work with him was really such a dream. He has such a canon that it&#39;s amazing that I keep watching movies of his that I hadn&#39;t seen before. I just watched &#34;School Daze&#34; recently, twice, and I am such a fan of his work, and continue to be. I feel lucky that I got to work with him. On being &#39;petrified&#39; on the set of &#39;Avengers: Age of Ultron&#39; and why Marvel characters are like Greek heroes Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch in &#34;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.&#34; Marvel Studios It&#39;s also been 10 years since you played Wanda in &#34; Avengers: Age of Ultron .&#34; With all that time and hindsight, is there anything that you look back on and view differently about that movie or your experience working on it? Oh, I was petrified. I was so scared. I didn&#39;t know how to take up space at all. And I felt good, actually, about that film. I think we established a foundation for her that we kept building off of. It&#39;s really nice to have had 10 years with the character. I have to say, it&#39;s something you don&#39;t always get to have unless you&#39;re doing television. So, if someone asked me to do it again in 50 years, I hope I&#39;m still around to play a very old version of her [ Laughs ]. Hey, if Hugh Jackman can do it, so can you. Yeah! After the events of &#34; Doctor Strange 2 ,&#34; there&#39;s a big question mark surrounding your character. Do you feel like there&#39;s unfinished business, or more to explore after Wanda&#39;s villain arc in that movie? I don&#39;t know if I feel like there&#39;s unfinished business, but I always feel like there&#39;s room to explore. I think the comic books have been going on for so many decades that there is such endless story that you can always go back to. How we make it work for the world that we&#39;ve established, I&#39;m not sure. But I do think you can always keep going back with these characters. They&#39;re like iconic Greek heroes, basically. And there&#39;s always stories to be had with those types of prototypes. On finding success outside the MCU and the role that marked a turning point Olsen playing infamous killer Candy Montgomery in &#34;Love &amp; Death.&#34; Jake Giles Netter/Max The MCU is vast, but all those projects can be time consuming. How have you navigated the balance of playing this character that you care about for so long and also getting to explore other material outside of that, like indie movies and TV series like &#34;Sorry for Your Loss,&#34; &#34;Ingrid Goes West,&#34; and &#34;Wind River&#34;? Well, it&#39;s just scheduling, I guess, at the end of the day. Sometimes things don&#39;t always work out, but I think those types of choices become really important, because if you&#39;re only doing Marvel projects, the way other producers or directors see you, they might make assumptions that you don&#39;t want to work on something super small, or you don&#39;t want to work on TV, and so your choices have to reflect what your interests are. I think sometimes that was hard for me because of what I was being offered, and sometimes I&#39;ve taken advantage of it in a way that I&#39;m proud of, but it&#39;s been a real balance to learn from. Was it a confidence boost for you to see the positive reactions to those things outside blockbusters? How did those movies and shows affect how you have viewed your career trajectory? I think you do a job because you want to feel fulfilled by the skill that you&#39;re trying to improve upon. &#34;Sorry for Your Loss&#34; for two years was one of the best [examples]. There&#39;s so many hours that were put into that, from pitching it with just a pilot to finishing the sound and the color correction on it. It was something that for two years of my life, I got to learn so much from, and I think that was a big moment that I started to find a different kind of fulfillment out of this job and a different kind of commitment. And I think it&#39;s just because of the hours you spend, just like anything else. So when people write anything positive about your work, of course your ego is grateful because then you think eyes will see it, and then you get a bit more of a boost of the next projects coming in, which is the goal. On her Marvel star power opening doors to more opportunities and feeling empowered to say no Paul Bettany as Vision and Olsen as Wanda in &#34;WandaVision.&#34; Marvel Studios Speaking more broadly, what&#39;s the best business decision that you ever made for your career? Probably doing Marvel, because if you&#39;re thinking about business, you&#39;re thinking about how you&#39;re able to take care of, I guess, a short-term future and a long-term future. Marvel has allowed me to bring eyes and potentially money to projects that are very small and maybe wouldn&#39;t have been seen in other iterations. So I think that&#39;s been very helpful from a business perspective. There&#39;s a piece of advice that you&#39;ve mentioned that has really guided you: &#34;No&#34; is a full sentence. Can you share a time in your career when you felt empowered to put that advice into practice? Well, the ones that first come up, I wouldn&#39;t want to share those because it is very empowering to say no, and I&#39;m also very private with the things I say no to. But it&#39;s an important thing to know that regardless of your own status or power dynamic, you always have that power. I think the biggest one that I can think of &mdash; without saying anything about it &mdash; I look back in hindsight, and I think, &#34;How did I have the confidence to say that?&#34; Because I wasn&#39;t in a position of power. It was very early in my career and I felt so confident to just speak what my boundaries were. So yeah, I think that&#39;s always good advice. It was probably being green that empowered you to just say that, right? Yeah, like, &#34;Whatever! This is what it is. You can either take it or leave it.&#34; I think I became even better at it later. But yeah, I think it is an important thing for everyone.

    "description": "I moved from Hawaii to England for love. My romance started like a fairy-tale, but didn&#39;t have the happy ending I wanted. Ashley Probst I&#39;m an American girl from Hawaii who fell in love with a British boy while studying in London. We started a long-distance relationship, and then I moved to England so we could be together. Six months later, I left feeling I&#39;d over-romanticized the idea of moving abroad for love. I&#39;ve always been obsessed with love stories. Growing up, I devoured every Disney princess movie and romantic comedy I could find, longing for my own happy ending. I fell in love quickly and often, hoping each time that it would finally be with my forever person. When I decided to spend my last semester of college studying abroad in London , I romanticized the experience in a different way. I was excited to explore the city&#39;s rich history, travel across Europe, and make new friends. I had no intention of entering a romantic relationship &mdash; but the moment I stopped looking for love, it found me. The start of our romance felt like magic At first, my new connection and I had so much fun exploring parts of the UK together. Ashley Probst My arrival in London was a whirlwind of navigating culture shock , city life, fresh faces, and an unfamiliar campus. Barely two weeks in, I went out to a bar with a group of women from my study-abroad program and met the man I would fall in love with. We had an instant connection on the dance floor, which led to spending the rest of the night together. We started talking daily and had our first date a week later. Weekly outings turned into overnights, then entire weekends. He invited me to meet his family in his hometown, where we expressed our love for the first time. We took our first of many international trips together and visited Milan , where we ate gelato, drank fine wine, and danced by the canal. During this time, I solo traveled frequently while he stayed in London awaiting my return. When my study-abroad program ended, I moved my belongings into his flat and spent a month traveling around Europe &mdash; a graduation present from my parents &mdash; until it was time to fly home to Maui. I soon realized moving abroad for love wasn&#39;t the fairy-tale I&#39;d been dreaming of Moving to England felt like a big jump. Ashley Probst I never expected to leave London in a long-distance relationship , but our connection had enchanted me. We set a date for him to visit me in Hawaii and found a rhythm of exchanging messages and video calls despite the 11-hour time difference. A few weeks into this routine, he asked me to return to England on a six-month tourist visa so we could be together. I accepted, ecstatic about going back to the country where we fell in love. But this time, my destination wasn&#39;t London. Instead, I moved to Hastings, a seaside town where the last interesting thing to happen there was probably the Battle of Hastings in 1066. I explored the entire place in two days, and boredom quickly set in. Since I was on a tourist visa, I couldn&#39;t work. I was a recent college graduate with no savings, so I didn&#39;t have money for outings or even a pint at the local pub. I felt isolated and relied on my partner for housing and social interaction. Most days, I stayed in the flat watching Netflix and playing video games until he got home. My main recreation became grocery-store runs, walks in the park, and occasional trips out of town. I tried starting various creative projects but was left feeling unfulfilled. Making dinner each night became my only sense of purpose. Shopping for groceries and cooking dinner wasn&#39;t fulfilling enough for me. Ashley Probst Each day blurred into the next, and I sunk deeper into a depression that I didn&#39;t recognize until it had already swallowed me whole. In retrospect, it hit me: I was an unemployed, stay-at-home girlfriend &mdash; and I didn&#39;t like that version of myself. As I struggled, so did our relationship. We fought more frequently, slipping into a cycle that followed us across continents, one that eventually led to our breakup. Now, I know love alone isn&#39;t enough to build a full life My return to England marked a major shift: Instead of arriving with an open mind, I carried expectations for both my time living abroad and the relationship I was chasing. However, the magic from my first visit had faded, and the reality was far from what I had envisioned. I realized love alone couldn&#39;t help me create the life I wanted with another person &mdash; I also needed to feel whole on my own. My experience in Hastings showed me that a healthy relationship requires stability, compatibility, and open communication, but it must be between individuals who both have a strong sense of self and independence. I hadn&#39;t anticipated how much losing the structure of school, work, and social connections would impact my mental health. If I had the chance to do things differently, I&#39;d prioritize finding remote work , building friendships, and taking better care of myself. Our love story didn&#39;t end how I&#39;d hoped, but it was still real, beautiful, and worth remembering &mdash; and I learned invaluable lessons I will never forget. Despite the challenges, I&#39;d do it all over again. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Seniors are flooding AARP with concerns about their Social Security retirement benefits",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/social-security-retirement-benefits-checks-aarp-call-center-doge-cuts-2025-3",
    "description": "AARP said calls have spiked due to seniors worried about their Social Security benefits. Matthias Balk/Picture Alliance via Getty Images AARP reports a surge in calls from retirees concerned about Social Security benefits. Seniors are worried about the Trump administration&#39;s budget cuts at the Social Security Administration. Office closures and staffing cuts could strain the agency as baby boomers retire and demand rises. Anxious retirees have been phoning AARP in droves about their Social Security benefits. A spokesperson said that since February 1, the nonprofit has received roughly 2,000 calls a week on the issue, and &#34;by far the number one&#34; concern is about disruptions to checks. &#34;They&#39;re really struggling to get by and Social Security is their lifeline,&#34; Bill Sweeney, AARP senior vice president, said of older Americans who rely on Social Security benefits to make ends meet. &#34;It&#39;s something they paid into their entire working lives from their very first paycheck until their very last.&#34; The spike in calls is double AARP&#39;s usual volume and is happening in response to the Trump administration&#39;s workforce reductions within the Social Security Administration. Though Trump has promised his administration won&#39;t touch benefits, retirees have reason to be concerned about the service they&#39;ll receive from the agency. Last month, wait times for calling Social Security averaged around an hour and 44 minutes, and Social Security administrators warned that customer service is going to get worse . For example, one change requires beneficiaries to present identification in person rather than online to prevent fraud. However, the agency also announced it would be closing some field offices, a move that could present further challenges to seniors and disabled Americans who don&#39;t have access to transportation or live in remote areas. Business Insider previously spoke to Social Security employees who said the agency was already overwhelmed before the White House&#39;s DOGE office came on the scene. Staffing has reached its lowest levels in 50 years &mdash; and demand for the agency&#39;s services is only growing as a wave of baby boomers hit retirement age. &#34;There&#39;s about 10,000 people turning 65 every single day in this country,&#34; Sweeney told BI. &#34;And there&#39;s more every day than the day before. And yet the staff at Social Security is going down.&#34; Nearly 73 million Americans receive Social Security benefits. Around 40% of older Americans rely solely on monthly checks for their retirement income, according to the National Institute for Retirement Security . The number of Americans over the age of 65 is projected to steadily increase to 80 million in 2040 . Judith Murray, 64, is one of them. Murray previously told BI that she lives on $1,311 a month in Social Security and a $1,174 monthly SNAP allotment in central Illinois. It&#39;s barely enough to cover essentials in a seven-person household, which includes some of her children and grandchildren and her fiancé, who recently lost his job. Any delays in Social Security payment would jeopardize Murray&#39;s ability to pay for housing and groceries &mdash; and she is already already behind on bills and doesn&#39;t have any savings. Murray said that, due to a disability, she&#39;s been relying on Social Security for several decades. Whether it&#39;s a supplement to retirement savings or a sole source of income, Social Security is one of the most popular federal programs with 87% of Americans saying it must remain a priority even with budget deficits. Frank Bisignano, a seasoned finance executive, fielded questions from Democrats during Tuesday&#39;s Senate Finance Committee hearing as Trump&#39;s pick to head the Social Security Administration. Bisignano vowed to continue operating the agency to serve the American people &#34;to ensure that every beneficiary receives their payments on time, that disability claims are processed in the manner they should be.&#34; When asked if he had plans to denationalize the service, he said no. &#34;I&#39;ve never thought about privatizing. It&#39;s not a word that anybody&#39;s ever talked to me about,&#34; the Wall Street veteran continued. &#34;I don&#39;t see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run for the benefit of the American public.&#34; Have a tip or story to share?

    "title": "Here's a look at 9 ultra-rich members of Congress",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-rich-lawmakers-personal-wealth-stock-trading-2025-3",
    "description": "These days, running for Congress isn&#39;t a cheap endeavor. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images It&#39;s not difficult to find wealthy lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Some members have amassed considerable levels of wealth from business ventures and investments. And it&#39;s not a partisan affair: Democrats and Republicans both have several ultra-rich members. When many Americans think of Capitol Hill, the image of well-heeled politicians often comes to mind. Sure, you don&#39;t have to be a multimillionaire to win a congressional race, but having an abundance of wealth doesn&#39;t hurt. That&#39;s especially the case for candidates who can self-fund, which allows parties to divert critical dollars to nominees in competitive races. While every lawmaker isn&#39;t rich &mdash; even as some have leveraged their profiles to attain lucrative book deals &mdash; there are many members who have net worths of at least $1 million. And then there are the lawmakers who are considerably wealthy, even by congressional standards. Here&#39;s a look at some of the richest members of Congress: Sen. Rick Scott of Florida Scott, who easily won reelection to a second term in November 2024, was a cofounder of HCA Healthcare and Solantic. Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images Scott &mdash; a former two-term Florida Republican governor who won a second term in the Senate in November 2024 &mdash; was a cofounder of both the Columbia Hospital Corporation and Solantic. The corporation merged with HCA in 1994, which created Columbia/HCA, a highly-recognizable operator of hospitals and health care facilities. (It&#39;s now known as HCA Healthcare). The senator has a reliably conservative voting record on Capitol Hill. Business Insider estimates Scott&#39;s net worth to be at least $296.3 million. Quiver Quantitative, a firm that tracks lawmakers&#39; stock trades and estimates their total net worths, estimates that Scott is worth roughly $550.7 million. Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma Hern cofounded a community bank in Oklahoma. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Hern, the current chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, has served in the lower chamber since November 2018. The congressman, who was once a manager at McDonald&#39;s, would eventually own 18 franchise locations in the Tulsa metropolitan area. He was also the cofounder of Firstar Bank, a community banking institution. BI estimates that Hern is worth at least $64.7 million. Quiver Quantitative&#39;s live estimate pegs Hern at $109.4 million. Rep. Darrell Issa of California Issa has long been one of the wealthiest House members. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Issa has represented parts of the San Diego area for more than two decades, with stints in the House from 2001 to 2019 and from 2021 to the present. An ex-chairman of the powerful Oversight Committee during much of former President Barack Obama&#39;s administration, BI estimates that Issa is worth at least roughly $309.4 million. Quiver&#39;s estimate is slightly lower at $234.7 million. The GOP congressman amassed much of his fortune from vehicle anti-theft products. According to his disclosure, Issa has an investment account worth over $50 million. He also has a line of credit at UBS tied to the account, but nothing was borrowed from it in 2023. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California Pelosi led the House Democratic Caucus for 20 years. John Lamparski/Getty Images Pelosi, who has served in the House since 1987, rose through the ranks to become the first female speaker in US history in 2007. When Democrats lost their House majority following the 2010 midterms, Pelosi stayed on as the party&#39;s leader in the lower chamber. She went on to reclaim the speaker&#39;s gavel in 2019, and Democrats retained control of the chamber until 2023. BI estimates that Pelosi is worth at least $50.9 million, while Quiver Quantitative places her at $285.05 million. Pelosi has drawn criticism over the years for enacting stock transactions where she and her husband, Paul Pelosi, have made significant profits. In 2021, Pelosi pushed back against pursuing a stock-trading ban for members when questioned by BI, but later said she&#39;d consider such proposals. (A Democratic-backed bill never came up for a vote in the 117th Congress.) Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia Warner has been seen as a pro-business Democrat throughout his political career. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Warner, a former Virginia governor now in his third term in the Senate, was a cofounder of the Capital Cellular Corporation in the late 1980s and made his fortune through early investments in the cellular telephone business. BI estimates Warner&#39;s worth at least $131.1 million, while Quiver estimates his worth at roughly $245.4 million. The Democratic lawmaker currently serves as the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and also sits on the Banking, Budget, Finance, and Rules committees. Rep. Dan Goldman of New York Prior to Goldman&#39;s election to Congress, he served as an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York. Drew Angerer/Getty Images In 2022, Goldman, an heir to the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. fortune, catapulted to the top of a crowded Democratic Party primary to represent New York&#39;s 10th Congressional District. He went on to easily win the general election race that year. Goldman ranks as one of the House&#39;s wealthiest members. BI estimates he is worth at least $158.1 million, while Quiver estimates that the Levi Strauss heir is roughly $183.6 million. The congressman previously served as an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York and was lead counsel in President Donald Trump&#39;s first impeachment trial. Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska Ricketts and several members of his family are part owners of the Chicago Cubs. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Ricketts, an ex-Nebraska governor and current US senator, is the son of billionaire businessman and TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts. Ricketts &mdash; also a part owner of the Chicago Cubs alongside several members of his family &mdash; is worth at least $79.4 million. Quiver estimates he is worth about $172.9 million. Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington Before coming to Congress, DelBene was an executive at Microsoft. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images DelBene has deep expertise in the world of tech, having served as an executive at Microsoft before jumping into politics and winning her first House race in 2012. The congresswoman, who currently chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is worth at least $70.9 million. Quiver estimates she is worth roughly $126.3 million. Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania McCormick won a hotly-contested Senate race in November 2024. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images McCormick, the former chief executive of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, first sought the GOP nomination for US Senate in 2022 &mdash; but narrowly fell short to celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz. (Oz went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman.) Two years later, McCormick won the Republican Senate nomination and a highly-competitive general election race against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr., an institution in Pennsylvania politics. McCormick is now a freshman senator, and he&#39;s among the body&#39;s wealthiest members. According to BI&#39;s estimates, McCormick is worth at least $123 million. A note about our methodology: Business Insider calculated lawmakers&#39; net worth based on their most recent financial disclosures. Members of Congress only have to estimate broad ranges over their assets. BI&#39;s estimates are based on the combined value of the lowest range of these estimates minus any liabilities lawmakers might have. Lawmakers are not required to report the value of their residence. Based on this conservative approach, BI&#39;s estimates will likely be significantly less than others, including Quiver Qualitative&#39;s. Unlike Quiver, BI did not calculate the live value of lawmakers&#39; stock holdings. Quiver&#39;s live estimates are as of March 25, 2025. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/bachelor-couples-still-together-2018-7",
    "description": "Juliana Pasquarosa and Grant Ellis are engaged. Anne Marie Fox/Disney/Getty Images There have been over 60 seasons of &#34; Bachelor &#34;-related TV. That means there have also been dozens of &#34;Bachelor&#34; relationships, both failed and successful. The latest season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; concluded on Monday. &#34; The Bachelor &#34; and its related spinoffs are about one thing: finding love. Yet, while there have been over 60 seasons of Bachelor Nation content, there are only 32 couples from the franchise still together. On March 24, Grant Ellis concluded his run as the 29th star of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; by successfully proposing to his season&#39;s winner, Juliana Pasquarosa. That means they&#39;ll be joining this list of couples from the franchise who are still together. Grant Ellis and Juliana Pasquarosa Grant Ellis and Juliana Pasquarosa in 2024. Anne Marie Fox/Disney/Getty Images Grant Ellis proposed to Juliana Pasquarosa during the March 2025 finale of &#34;The Bachelor.&#34; It&#39;s been something of a tough season for Ellis, who was a fan-favorite when he appeared on Jenn Tran&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2024, but he pulled through and found his happily ever after (at least, for now). Joey Graziadei and Kelsey Anderson Graziadei and Anderson. John Fleenor/Disney/ABC Joey Graziadei proposed to Kelsey Anderson during the March 2024 finale of &#34;The Bachelor.&#34; Graziadei has become a fan-favorite lead in this long and storied franchise since he came in second on Charity Lawson&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2023. In fact, his Fantasy Suites episode was the most-watched episode of the show since the 2022 finale of Clayton Echard&#39;s season, according to Variety . So, many people were delighted to see him propose to Anderson on a beach in Tulum and to watch her say yes. They confirmed during &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; that they are still engaged, and have since moved to Los Angeles after Graziadei won &#34;Dancing with the Stars.&#34; Dotun Olubeko and Charity Lawson Lawson and Olubeko in November 2023. Emma McIntyre/Variety/Getty Images Dotun Olubeko got down on one knee and proposed to Charity Lawson, as fans saw on the &#34;Bachelorette&#34; finale in August 2023. Lawson, who appeared on Zach Shallcross&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; earlier in the year, proved herself to be a steadying presence on a show usually filled with drama. &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; viewers saw Olubeko and Lawson develop a strong relationship, grow as a couple, and eventually get engaged in Fiji. &#34;We&#39;re not really trying to have a super incredibly 17-year length engagement,&#34; Lawson told People following the finale. &#34;We obviously came here to find love, and we have successfully done that.&#34; Tessa Tookes and Joey Kirchner Tookes and Kirchner in 2022. CityTv Tessa Tookes, who appeared on Clayton Echard&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; found love on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise Canada&#34; in 2022. She married Joey Kirchner in September 2024. Tookes, who was eliminated during week two of Echard&#39;s season in 2022, provided viewers with a franchise first during the season two finale of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise Canada&#34;: She became the first woman to propose to a man on the show when she asked Kirchner (first seen on season one of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise Canada&#34; in 2021) to marry her. Speaking to Yahoo Canada about her decision, Tookes said, &#34;I know my love for Joey. Even if he declined, I&#39;d still feel really good about making that call. And women can propose.&#34; She added, &#34;It felt really good to do something that&#39;s never been done before.&#34; According to an Instagram post by Tookes, the two wed in September 2024 in Ontario. Zach Shallcross and Kaity Biggar Zach Shallcross and Kaity Biggar in January 2024. James Clark/Disney/Getty Images Fans watched as Zach Shallcross successfully proposed to Kaity Biggar in March 2023. After a very dramatic final week as the lead, Shallcross &mdash; who originally appeared on Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2022 &mdash; got down on one knee in Thailand and proposed to Biggar during the finale, which aired in March 2023. That month, Shallcross told People , &#34;Right now, the main emphasis is living together in Austin, getting to know each other more and more, and just see how things go. There&#39;s no rush.&#34; In July 2023, Biggar posted on Instagram that the two are &#34;officially roommates&#34; in Austin together, and are still together in 2025 &mdash; they even set a wedding date for later this year. Serena Pitt and Joe Amabile Pitt and Amabile in December 2021. Rich Polk/E! Entertainment/NBCUniversal/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Serena Pitt and Joe Amabile got married (again) in Charleston in September 2023 after meeting on the seventh season of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise.&#34; Throughout the entire seventh season of &#34;Paradise,&#34; there wasn&#39;t a stronger couple than &#34;Grocery Store Joe&#34; Amabile (originally from Becca Kufrin&#39;s season in 2018) and Pitt (from Matt James&#39; season in 2021). Even though Amabile&#39;s &#34;Paradise&#34; ex, Kendall Long, showed up at the proposal, nothing could shake their relationship. They left the beach engaged in fall 2021, and just over a year later, they got married at a New York City courthouse with &#34;Paradise&#34; castmate Natasha Parker as a witness. The couple posted footage from their courthouse ceremony to Instagram in October 2022 and wrote in the caption that they still planned to have a wedding the following September. Shortly after getting married, they told People : &#34;We still plan on having a big wedding next fall that we are already planning, but with everything being so public in our relationship, having a private moment just the two of us felt so special and intimate.&#34; In September 2023, they got married again, this time in front of their friends and family &mdash; with &#34;Paradise&#34; bartender Wells Adams officiating.

Braasch, from Clare Crawley and Tayshia Adams&#39; season in 2020, then started pursuing castmates Demi Burnett and Tia Booth. However, Pepin soon decided she wanted Braasch back, and they got back together. He even proposed at the end of the season. As People reported, the two got married in Puerto Rico in November 2023. Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs Kufrin and Jacobs in June 2022. Dara-Michelle Farr via Getty Images Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs broke up, but they later rekindled their romance off-screen. Now, they&#39;re married, and Kufrin gave birth to their first child in September 2023. After getting dumped on TV by Arie Luyendyk in 2018, Kufrin went on to star in her own season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; that year. She confirmed on an episode of her podcast, &#34;Bachelor Happy Hour,&#34; that her relationship with the winner, Garrett Yrigoyen, ended in 2020. Then, when Kufrin appeared on &#34;Paradise&#34; in 2021, she was hesitant to date Jacobs, who had appeared on Katie Thurston&#39;s season earlier in the year and was portrayed as one of the season&#39;s villains. However, the two built a solid relationship during the show, until Kufrin called things off during the &#34;Paradise&#34; finale. The two reconnected off-screen and began dating. In May 2022, they revealed on Instagram that they&#39;d gotten engaged and, as Kufrin wrote in the caption, &#34;in the ultimate plot twist,&#34; she proposed to Jacobs. In October 2022, Jacobs returned the favor and proposed to Kufrin. &#34;We are so excited! It&#39;s time we can finally start wedding planning,&#34; Kufrin told People at the time. Kufrin announced her pregnancy in April 2023. In September 2023, the two confirmed the birth of their son, Benson, on Instagram. The next month, they tied the knot. Noah Erb and Abigail Heringer Abigail Heringer and Noah Erb in December 2022. Paul Archuleta/Getty Images Noah Erb and Abigail Heringer got married in October 2024. Heringer, from Matt James&#39; season in 2021, and Erb, from Tayshia Adams&#39; season in 2020, went on the first date of their season of &#34;Paradise&#34; and they were together for the entire season, with a few hiccups along the way. In the penultimate episode of the season, Erb decided that he was simultaneously falling in love with Heringer and&nbsp;didn&#39;t think she was &#34;his person.&#34; They left Mexico separately. But like Kufrin and Jacobs, the two reconnected post-&#34;Paradise,&#34; which they confirmed during the reunion in October 2021. The two announced on Instagram in August 2023 that they were engaged, accompanied by a caption that referenced Taylor Swift&#39;s song &#34;Lover.&#34; They wed 14 months later in Oklahoma. Chris Conran and Alana Milne Conran and Milne in December 2021. Paul Archuleta/Getty Images Chris Conran and Alana Milne got kicked off &#34;Paradise&#34; together in 2021. They got engaged in March 2024. Conran, who was eliminated on night one of Clare Crawley&#39;s season in 2020, was originally dating Jessenia Cruz of Matt James&#39; season in 2021, but that changed when Alana Milne, also from James&#39; season, entered the beach. The two quickly decided to pursue a relationship, leaving Cruz in the dust. In turn, everyone on the beach ganged up on them and claimed that they&#39;d been dating pre-&#34;Paradise,&#34; a claim they both denied. After the cast essentially told them that none of them would speak to the couple if they stayed, they left separately. But then Conran and Milne were spotted hanging out together, and Milne confirmed the relationship on her Instagram story, posting a photo of the two kissing captioned, &#34;Paradise is wherever I&#39;m with you.&#34; Conran reposted and wrote: &#34;3 months of no cameras or producers.&#34; In March 2024, the duo posted on Instagram confirming their engagement. Dylan Barbour and Hannah Godwin Barbour and Godwin in June 2022. Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images After a rocky start, Dylan Barbour and Hannah Godwin made it through season six of &#34;BIP.&#34; They got married at a French estate in August 2023. Barbour (from Hannah Brown&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2019) made it clear that he was only there for Godwin &mdash; who was left blindsided on Colton Underwood&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; also in 2019 &mdash; during the first episode of season six of &#34;Paradise&#34; in 2019. However, she needed a little more time to explore things with Blake Horstmann, a runner-up on Becca Kufrin&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette.&#34; Horstmann had even flown down to Alabama to visit her before the two began filming for &#34;Bachelor in Paradise,&#34; a fact that was withheld from the rest of the cast (and the viewing public) until the fourth episode. But Godwin chose to stick with Barbour, and the two got engaged on the finale, which aired in September 2019. They married in August 2023. Dean and Caelynn Bell Dean and Caelynn in December 2022. Steve Granitz/FilmMagic/Getty Images After meeting on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; in 2019, Dean Bell (née) Unglert and Caelynn Bell (née) Miller-Keyes wed in September 2023. When Unglert, who was on Rachel Lindsay&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2017, left &#34;Paradise&#34; early, Miller-Keyes was devastated. But he returned to say he had made a mistake and asked Miller-Keyes to leave Mexico with him to figure out their relationship. This wasn&#39;t a complete surprise, as E! News reported in July 2019 that the two were dating, but fans finally got to see how their relationship unfolded during an episode of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; that aired in September 2019. Miller-Keyes, who made it to hometown dates on Colton Underwood&#39;s season in 2018, left behind her rebound guy, Connor Saeli, from Hannah Brown&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2019 to join Unglert in his much-discussed van. In October 2022, a source told People that Unglert and Miller-Keyes were engaged. That month, Unglert also spoke about the proposal during an episode of his podcast with fellow &#34;Bachelor&#34; alum Jared Haibon. A few days later, Unglert confirmed the news on his Instagram . They married in September 2023 at a Colorado mountain resort outside Aspen and changed their last names to Bell, Unglert&#39;s mother&#39;s maiden name.

They&#39;re now married with two kids. Known affectionately by their fellow &#34;Paradise&#34; contestants as &#34;Mom and Dad,&#34; the cast was shocked when the most solid couple of the season broke up on the last day of &#34;Paradise&#34; during season five in September 2018. Wendt, straight off a stint on &#34;Bachelor Winter Games&#34; in 2018, copped to still being affected by his split from ex-girlfriend Ashley Iaconetti (who appears elsewhere on this list). Loch, from Nick Viall&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2017, was blindsided. The two were brought together again during the reunion episode. They got engaged in August 2019 and welcomed their son August in November 2021, People reported. They married in October 2022. In February 2023, Loch shared that they were expecting their second child, and their son, Nash, was born in October. Arie Luyendyk and Lauren Burnham Burnham and Luyendyk in July 2018. Presley Ann/Getty Images Arie Luyendyk and Lauren Burnham got engaged on the &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special after Luyendyk shocked the world by dumping Becca Kufrin on TV. They&#39;re now married with three kids. Luyendyk first appeared on the eighth season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2012, competing for the love of Emily Maynard. He eventually became the runner-up. In 2017, ABC made the surprising move to bring him back for the 22nd season&nbsp;of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; where viewers watched him propose to Kufrin . Soon after the proposal, however, Luyendyk decided he had made a mistake and contacted Burnham, the runner-up from his season, before breaking up with Kufrin while the cameras were rolling, making for a controversial moment in Bachelor Nation&#39;s history. Luyendyk and Burnham began their relationship anew, and he proposed to her on the live &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special, which aired after the finale in March 2018. They had a destination wedding in Hawaii in January 2019, People reported, and their daughter, Alessi, was born in May of that year.

After finishing in second place, she made her way to Mexico for &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; that August where she met Gottschalk, who had been a contestant on Rachel Lindsay&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; earlier that year. In June 2019, they shared matching Instagram posts announcing their engagement. Gates revealed on social media that they postponed their May 2020 wedding due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but they finally married in April 2021, as she shared on Instagram .

Years later, Fletcher and Rodgers are still together . In fact, in August 2019, Rodgers &#34;re-proposed&#34; to Fletcher, complete with a new ring, as Fletcher shared on Instagram . In May 2022, after six years together and two postponed wedding dates, Fletcher and Rodgers married at a California winery. The couple also had a reality series on CNBC, &#34;Cash Pad,&#34; where they partnered with &#34;homeowners hoping to turn their properties into ideal short-term rentals,&#34; according to the network.

At the time, Iaconetti was smitten, but Haibon wasn&#39;t as interested. According to a 45-minute video the couple released on Iaconetti&#39;s YouTube channel about&nbsp;how they fell in love, Haibon realized he had to make his move when Iaconetti returned from &#34;Bachelor Winter Games&#34; in 2018 with a boyfriend (Kevin Wendt). Their relationship was made Instagram-official in May 2018, and Haibon proposed just a few weeks later, as E! News reported. The couple married in Rhode Island in August 2019, with a number of Bachelor Nation members in attendance at their wedding, as People reported at the time. In March 2021, they announced their move to Rhode Island on Instagram and opened Audrey&#39;s Coffeehouse and Lounge in South Kingstown. Their son, Dawson, was born in January 2022.

Tolbert was originally on Kaitlyn Bristowe&#39;s season, while Roper was on Chris Soules&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelor,&#34; both in 2015. But now, &#34;Janner,&#34; as they&#39;re known, are the gold standard for &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; couples. They were the first in the spinoff&#39;s history to get engaged and actually get married &mdash; there had been a few false starts with other couples &mdash; and they have been making it work ever since their finale aired in September 2015. They had their issues &mdash; which were shown on their season of &#34;Marriage Boot Camp&#34; in 2016&nbsp;&mdash; but they worked through them. Their first daughter, Emerson, was born in August 2017. Their son, Brooks, was born in July 2019, after Roper gave birth in her closet, which she shared on Instagram . And in November 2020, they welcomed their third child, Reed. In August 2023, Roper shared on Instagram that she was experiencing &#34;a missed miscarriage,&#34; and said her unborn son&#39;s heart had stopped though her body hadn&#39;t &#34;released the pregnancy yet.&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve been carrying him with so much pride and cherish every moment still left with part of him, but it has also been equally as challenging and devastating,&#34; she wrote.

Hartsock originally appeared on Sean Lowe&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2013, but she was sent home. Her season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; was especially controversial &mdash; she was broken up with by Brooks Forester during the second-to-last week of the show, who many considered to be the frontrunner. Some fans believed Hartsock was settling when she accepted Siegfried&#39;s proposal back in August 2013. Despite the controversy, Siegfried and Hartsock got married in January 2015. Their son, Asher, was born a year later. In July 2018, the couple told Us Weekly that they were expecting their second child, Zander. He was born in January 2019.

In May 2024, she was named the star of the first season of &#34;The Golden Bachelorette.&#34; Chapple was a frontrunner throughout the season, so it wasn&#39;t a big surprise when he got down on one knee and proposed.

He proposed to Rycroft, dumped her on &#34;After the Final Rose,&#34; and immediately asked Malaney if they could resume their relationship in March 2009, which they discussed during an interview with People that month. Malaney and Mesnick were engaged later that year in October 2009, Mesnick confirmed to Us Weekly , and were married just a few months later. Now, they&#39;re one of the few &#34;Bachelor&#34; success stories, even if their love story didn&#39;t start off in the most conventional way. They had their daughter Riley in 2013. Things worked out for Rycroft, too. After the breakup, she reunited with her ex, Tye Strickland. They got married in 2009, and have three kids.

Just uttering the words &#34;Trista and Ryan&#34; around a &#34;Bachelor&#34; fan will send them on a trip down memory lane. The year was 2003, and Trista was the very first &#34;Bachelorette,&#34; after getting sent home as the runner-up of the first season of &#34;The Bachelor.&#34; Rehn chose Sutter in the finale, and he proposed.

Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images Brendan Morais and Serene Russell shocked &#34;Bachelor&#34; fans when they hard-launched their relationship on Instagram in March 2025 &mdash; there hadn&#39;t been any speculation about their relationship at all. It&#39;s been a minute since either was on TV, but here&#39;s where you know them from: Morais was initially on Tayshia Adams&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2020, but left because he wasn&#39;t ready to propose. He then controversially appeared on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; in 2021 &mdash; although he spent the beginning of the season pursuing Natasha Parker, it was revealed he was basically killing time until Pieper James (from Matt James&#39; season in 2021) walked on the beach. They dated for a while but eventually broke up at some point in 2023 or 2024. Russell first appeared on Clayton Echard&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2022. That same year, she traveled to Mexico for season eight of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; and got engaged to Brandon Jones (Michelle Young&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette,&#34; 2021).

Bowers, of Lawson&#39;s season, might have been eliminated from &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; after failing to secure a rose, but he was still able to find love within the franchise. During the finale of season nine of &#34;Paradise,&#34; which aired in December 2023, it was revealed that Bowers has been dating Mandrell, from Shallcross&#39; season, for the last few months. &#34;Beyond the cameras and reality show drama, Brayden (aka MY BOYFRIEND!) and I found something truly special,&#34; Mandrell wrote on Instagram . On the red carpet of Turner and Nist&#39;s televised wedding in January, Bowers got down on one knee and proposed to Mandrell, who accepted, as seen on Instagram. They surprised fans later that year by eloping, per People . Anna Redman and Chris Bukowski Bukowski in 2019 and Redman in 2021. Paul Archuleta/Getty Images Anna Redman and Chris Bukowski announced their relationship on Instagram in March 2022.

While these two never interacted on-screen, they&#39;re both &#34;Bachelor&#34; alums. Bukowski has famously appeared on multiple seasons, including Emily Maynard&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette,&#34; season three of &#34;Bachelor Pad,&#34; and three seasons of &#34;Bachelor in Paradise.&#34; He unsuccessfully attempted to join Andi Dorfman&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; as well. Bachelor Nation reported that Bukowski got engaged to Katie Morton on his last appearance on &#34;Paradise&#34; in 2019, but they broke up a few months later, according to a since-deleted Instagram post. You might remember Redman from her controversial appearance on Matt James&#39; season of &#34;The Bachelor&#34; in 2021 when she spread rumors that a fellow contestant was &#34;entertaining men for money.&#34; She later briefly appeared on &#34;Bachelor in Paradise&#34; later that year.

She later appeared on the first season of &#34;Bachelor Pad.&#34; Lambton, on the other hand, made it all the way to the final two in Ali Fedotowsky&#39;s season of&nbsp; &#34;The Bachelorette&#34; in 2010, and even turned down the opportunity to be the next &#34;Bachelor,&#34; he told Boston.com .

    "title": "Digital clutter is still clutter. It takes time, but here's how to tackle it. ",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/professional-declutterer-shares-tips-to-handle-digital-clutter-2025-3",
    "description": "The author (not pictured) shares how to tackle digital clutter. Jacques Julien/Getty Images I&#39;m a professional declutterer and work with clients to get rid of things they don&#39;t need anymore. Digital clutter can be as time-consuming as physical clutter. Try unsubscribing to five emails you don&#39;t want a day to clear your inbox. Digital clutter is real , and you&#39;ve likely got some, particularly if you&#39;re paying for extra storage space. Holding on to extra files, apps, and other digital assets not only costs money, but it&#39;s also costing us all in terms of the environment. In fact, computing has now surpassed the airline industry&#39;s carbon footprint . It turns out the cloud is not, in fact, a gentle, fluffy, amorphous part of the atmosphere. Instead, hundreds of server farms use vast amounts of water and electricity. And every email, photo, and meme you&#39;ve got on your devices is contributing to the problem. So, how do you rid yourself of the excess? Just like physical decluttering , it takes time and effort, but it can be done and doesn&#39;t have to cause you pain and suffering. Start with your email Most of us receive more than we could ever read, so start with unsubscribing . Yes, it&#39;s easier to simply delete, but if you&#39;d like to avoid getting weekly or even daily marketing emails from that candle company you gave your email address to in order to save 10% on your only purchase, you&#39;ve got to go to the source. Feeling overwhelmed? See who you&#39;re getting unwanted emails from, whether that&#39;s marketing, newsletters, or alerts, and try unsubscribing from five per day. While you are at it, try deleting every email after you&#39;ve read it; this will make your inbox more manageable. Delete apps you don&#39;t use Apps are fun and useful at the best of times but drain your battery and storage at the worst. Scroll through your list to see which ones you&#39;re using and which you can delete. While you&#39;re at it, make sure you&#39;re not paying for any that you don&#39;t use. There&#39;s no need for FOMO when it comes to apps; if you find you&#39;d like an app back, it takes just seconds to download it back onto your device. Purge your contacts Do you have contacts labeled &#34;Bill &mdash; dishwasher guy&#34; or simply &#34;Edith&#34; with no other distinguishing features? It&#39;s time to go through the list and delete anyone whose name you do not recognize or who is no longer a part of your life. In the worst-case scenario, if they text you again, you can always ask who they are and save them again with all of their information. Bookmarks are helpful if organized Bookmarks are helpful until you have a list longer than your arm with no discernible organization. The whole point of bookmarking websites is so that you can find them again easily. If your collection is a mishmash of recipes, tax preparation advice, and articles you&#39;re still planning to read, it&#39;s time to do some tidying. Think of those bookmarks as pieces of paper strewn around your desk. If they&#39;re not in file folders, you&#39;ve just got a mess on your hands. So, set up a filing system, but mostly? Simply delete. Unorganized digital folders are not helpful This is a good time to determine what the word &#34;important&#34; means to you. Does every file you&#39;ve ever created have equal weight? Or are some of them languishing in digital folders because you just can&#39;t quite figure out what to do with them? Chances are you&#39;re keeping a lot of stuff that&#39;s out of date or just not relevant to your current life or work. Use a critical eye, and don&#39;t be scared to use the delete key. If the information is available elsewhere on the internet (bank statements, recipes), let someone else pay to store it and access it when necessary. While you&#39;re at it, look at your file structure. Does it lend itself to easy retrieval? If you can&#39;t figure out what should go where, take a look at your paper files. See if you can use the same organizational system for your digital info. We tend to assume we have more time (and interest) to get back to things than we do. It&#39;s so easy to download a thing, bookmark it, or flag it for later. But the reality is that the internet is vast and growing every day. There&#39;s hardly time to take in what&#39;s coming at you today, let alone to look backward at what caught your eye last month. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "CIA director John Ratcliffe defends involvement in botched Signal chat, denies sharing classified information",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/cia-head-signal-use-senate-hearing-the-atlantic-tulsi-gabbard-2025-3",
    "description": "CIA Director John Ratcliffe testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday. Valerie Plesch for The Washington Post via Getty Images CIA Director John Ratcliffe testified that using Signal for work is allowed by the CIA. The Atlantic&#39;s editor-in-chief was added to a Signal chat where Trump officials discussed war plans. Trump intelligence officials claimed in a Senate hearing that no classified info was shared. Using the encrypted messaging app Signal is permitted by the CIA, Trump&#39;s CIA director says. In an explosive Monday report from The Atlantic, editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg detailed how he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat in which Trump administration national security leaders discussed upcoming strikes on Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels . The outlet&#39;s report was a hot topic at a tense Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday, where US intelligence officials were asked what was discussed in the Signal group chat, and whether it was classified. When questioned by Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee&#39;s vice chairman, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said that he was part of the Signal group chat reported by The Atlantic. He also said that the CIA routinely uses the end-to-end encrypted app. &#34;One of the first things that happened when I was confirmed as CIA director was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA as it is for most CIA officers,&#34; Ratcliffe said. He said that the CIA records management team briefed him on the permissible use of Signal as a practice that he said was also allowed under the Biden administration. &#34;It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes. Provided that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels. So those were procedures that were implemented. My staff implemented those processes,&#34; Ratcliffe said. &#34;My communications, to be clear, in a Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,&#34; he added. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was apparently also in the chat, according to Goldberg. She at first refused to answer questions on Tuesday about whether she was in it, but later implied that she was when she repeatedly said she could not &#34;recall&#34; specific content discussed in the Signal group. Last week, the Pentagon sent out internal guidance warning about the vulnerability of using Signal, according to NPR . &#34;Russian professional hacking groups are employing the &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations,&#34; the memo reads. &#34;Please note: third-party messaging apps (e.g. Signal) are permitted by policy for unclassified accountability/recall exercises but are not approved to process or store non-public unclassified information.&#34; Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard said that the information discussed in the chat was not classified. But Sen. Warner and other Democrats repeatedly argued that the Signal chat likely contained classified information. &#34;This pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy,&#34; Warner said. &#34;Make no mistake, these actions make America less safe.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/signal-founder-pokes-fun-at-military-group-chat-mistake-2025-3",
    "description": "Moxie Marlinspike, aka Matthew Rosenfeld, is the founder and former CEO of Signal. Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch Signal&#39;s founder, Moxie Marlinspike, poked fun at the military group-chat leak in a post on X. He used the incident as an opportunity to ironically promote the platform. US officials, however, have expressed alarm over the security breach. A major security leak involving the secure messaging platform Signal sparked widespread alarm throughout the country &mdash; but the platform&#39;s founder didn&#39;t appear very concerned. In a post on X on Monday afternoon, Moxie Marlinspike, whose real name is Matthew Rosenfeld, poked fun at the group message leak and used it to ironically promote the &#34;many great reasons to be on Signal.&#34; &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations,&#34; the founder of the platform and its former CEO wrote in the post. There are so many great reasons to be on Signal. Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations. Don’t sleep on this opportunity… &mdash; Moxie Marlinspike (@moxie) March 24, 2025 Marlinspike was referring to Monday&#39;s news that The Atlantic&#39;s editor in chief was accidentally added to a Signal group chat called &#34;Houthi PC small group.&#34; &#34;PC&#34; referred to the principal committee, and the chat was primarily made up of senior US officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence&nbsp; Tulsi Gabbard , and Secretary of State&nbsp; Marco Rubio . The chat&#39;s participants were discussing forthcoming strikes on Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels , Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic&#39;s editor in chief, revealed in an article. Marlinspike wasn&#39;t the only social media user to poke fun at the snafu. However, comments on his post were mixed, with some blaming the officials who made the mistake and others saying that the platform should improve its security. Marlinspike&#39;s reaction is in sharp contrast to that of that of Democratic and Republican officials, many of whom expressed alarm at the security leak. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters the incident &#34;sounds like a huge screwup&#34; and that &#34;somebody dropped the ball.&#34; Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho said Tuesday there will be an investigation into the incident, The Hill reported . Signal is a nonprofit, open-sourced, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform that has emerged as one of the most popular messaging apps over the last few years. Only recipients can see messages, so it&#39;s commonly used by journalists, government officials, and tech giants. Neither Signal nor Marlinspike responded to a request for comment from Business Insider. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/napster-making-comeback-metaverse-music-platform-millennials-2025-3",
    "description": "A New York University student downloaded music from Napster in 2001. Spencer Platt/Getty Images Napster is back? If you&#39;re confused, you&#39;re not alone. Internet users expressed disbelief that the brand still existed &mdash; let alone had sold for $207 million. &#34;Napster? Is it 1999?&#34; The news on Tuesday that Napster had been sold for $207 million sparked disbelief as millennials experienced a hearty dose of nostalgia. The controversial OG music-sharing platform, founded in 1999 by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker and shut down by court order in 2001 after throwing the music industry into a panic, has been purchased by the 3D tech company Infinite Reality. The company appears to be planning to use the brand for a &#34;Fortnite&#34; concerts-like metaverse play , writing that it wants to use Napster to &#34;create branded 3D virtual spaces where fans can enjoy virtual concerts.&#34; The internet quickly let the jokes and memes rip. &#34;What next, you gonna tell me Limewire sold for $100 million??&#34; one Redditor wrote. &#34;Napster still exists?&#34; another wrote. Others let a popular Robin Williams &#34;What YEAR is it?&#34; meme express their confusion. Reddit users shared a popular GIF of Robin Williams in &#34;Jumanji&#34; to express their confusion at the Napster news. Reddit Then there was the sticker shock. &#34;I like to think I understand tech but I have no idea how this is worth over $200 million,&#34; one internet user wrote. Some shared nostalgic memories of the freewheeling nature of the music-file-sharing era. &#34;I remember coming home from high school being the king pin of burnt various song CD&#39;s and seeing Napster shutdown,&#34; one wrote. And it turns out that the Napster of today still has users. &#34;As a Napster/Rhapsody subscriber for the last 10 years, yes it was still around and you were missing out,&#34; another wrote. &#34;It was by far the best music service for price, library and sound.&#34; Other Napster users wondered whether the sale to a new company would change the service. &#34;I actually still use napster and enjoy it. Hope this doesnt change that,&#34; one Redditor wrote. &#34;I mean I use it everyday. Never had any issues,&#34; they added. &#34;I would say the library isn&#39;t big as Spotify. I like weird music sometimes I hear in random Internet s&mdash;t and I&#39;d say I can find 80% of it on Napster.&#34; The Napster you remember has been gone for decades Napster has changed hands multiple times since its court-ordered shutdown in 2001. Portland Press Herald via Getty Images For many millennials, the beep, hiss, and hum of dial-up internet was a necessary prelude to listening to Britney Spears&#39; &#34;Baby One More Time&#34; or Lou Bega&#39;s &#34;Mambo No. 5.&#34; Years before there was on-demand streaming or officially licensed song downloads, Napster shook up the music industry with technology that allowed users to easily share their audio files with other people around the world for free. In the comparatively lawless days of these early internet startups, this approach proved to be a little too disruptive and the company was soon sued into oblivion. The Recording Industry of America Association and the heavy-metal group Metallica argued that the service allowed illegal transfers that encouraged the violation of artists&#39; copyrights (and deprived them of revenue from album sales). Soon, the original website was shut down. Over the years, the brand and assets were sold to a string of owners, including Roxio, Best Buy, and Rhapsody. Even with its ups and downs, the company left its mark on modern media distribution &mdash; it was Daniel Ek&#39;s inspiration for Spotify &mdash; and the former piracy platform has since transformed into a modestly sized business that now plays by the rules. As one Redditor succinctly put it: &#34;The Napster of today has nothing to do with the Napster of 25 years ago.&#34; Now, Napster&#39;s story appears to have another chapter, and its new owner seems ready to push once again into uncharted territory. Infinite Reality, which bills itself as an immersive reality company, announced in January that it raised around $3 billion from an undisclosed investor. The metaverse company has been acquisitive in the past, purchasing the esports and influencer company ReKTGlobal in 2022 and the immersive tech company Landvault in 2024. As it happens, Napster now has the licenses to (legally) stream millions of music tracks, and John Acunto, Infinite Reality&#39;s CEO, told CNBC the plan is to build virtual spaces for concerts, listening parties, and merch sales. &#34;When we think about clients who have audiences &mdash; influencers, creators &mdash; I think it&#39;s very important that they have a connected space that&#39;s around music and musical communities,&#34; Acunto told the outlet. &#34;We just don&#39;t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.&#34; &#34;I think there&#39;s no better name than Napster to disrupt,&#34; he added.

Construction on the &#34;Hotel of Doom&#34; began in 1987 and has stopped and started several times. One side of the 1,080-foot building has been outfitted with LED screens used for light shows. At 1,080 feet, North Korea &#39;s Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang is one of the tallest unoccupied buildings in the world. The 105-story &#34;Hotel of Doom,&#34; which is also North Korea&#39;s tallest building, has never hosted a single guest. Construction began almost 40 years ago, and it is not yet complete &mdash; the cost of finishing the building is estimated to be around 5% of the country&#39;s entire GDP. Still, Ryugyong Hotel remains a subject of international fascination. Here&#39;s the story behind the abandoned skyscraper that dominates the capital city&#39;s skyline.

In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL’s Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether. At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player.

Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were 31. The Warriors’ return to the pinnacle of basketball had the whiff of a last hurrah, and indeed, their championship core faded for a second time after that: a second-round exit in 2023, a play-in tournament flatlining in 2024.

The top-seeded Trojans kept going without their star player, pummeling Mississippi State 96-59 to reach the Sweet 16 for the second straight year, but the injury cast a shadow over the entire evening as one of college basketball’s biggest stars was left in serious distress. Watkins was streaking to the basket chased by two defenders when her knee bent awkwardly as she planted her right leg, the non-contact injury causing her to crumple to the floor. The crowd went silent as she writhed in pain and clutched her knee while her teammates looked on helplessly and USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb rushed to her side. ESPN reported that the 19-year-old has torn her ACL and will undergo surgery. Watkins was averaging 24.6 points this season for USC. Continue reading...",
