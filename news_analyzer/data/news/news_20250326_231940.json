Ten people claiming to be affected by the translocation from Liwonde national park have begun legal action against the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), demanding that the conservation NGO construct adequate fencing to protect the 167 villages around the park and compensate local people for the damage caused by the elephants.

    "description": "In today’s newsletter: With elbows up on both sides, two very different political operators – Mark Carney and the Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre – attempt to fend off threats from the south Good morning. When Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning as Canada’s prime minister in January, he did so amid surging support for the Conservative opposition and a sense that its Trump-adjacent leader, Pierre Poilievre, might be the right candidate for a new political era. The Liberals’ near-decade in power appeared to be close to an end. Now, Trudeau’s successor, the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, has called a snap general election against a dramatically different political backdrop. With Donald Trump’s tariff war and musings about Canada’s future as a 51st state the inescapable mood music, many voters who had given up on the Liberals appear ready to give them another hearing – and Poilievre is trying to distance himself from the president whose methods he was once so happy to adopt. Trump administration | A catastrophic security leak triggered outrage in US politics after senior Trump administration officials accidentally broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along. The stunning breach implicates key figures in the Trump administration including the vice-president, JD Vance. Domestic violence | Domestic abusers are driving their victims to suicide , police have warned, as they admitted to past mistakes and pledged to investigate more “hidden” cases of violence against women. The concession came as deaths by suicide among victims of domestic abuse surpassed the number of people killed by an intimate partner for a second year in a row. UK economy | Rachel Reeves will put £2bn into affordable housing in a bid to “sweeten the pill” of the spending cuts being announced at this week’s spring statement. The chancellor will set out one of the tightest budget buffers on record, with the Office for Budget Responsibility expected to put the government about £5bn in the red. Turkey | Turkish authorities have arrested more than 1,100 people including journalists , while bombarding the social media platform X with requests to block hundreds of accounts after tens of thousands took to the streets in the largest anti-government demonstrations in years. Archaeology | One of the biggest and most important iron age hoards ever found in the UK has been revealed, potentially altering our understanding of life in Britain 2,000 years ago. More than 800 objects were unearthed in a field near the village of Melsonby, North Yorkshire dating back to the first century. Continue reading...",

It marks the end of a three-and-a-half year investigation into the university’s handling of the case of Kathleen Stock, a philosophy professor who resigned after being targeted by protests over her views on gender identification and transgender rights.

Polyamory, open relationships and swinging are among the many forms of consensual non-monogamy. Polyamory has become increasingly mainstream, with a recent poll showing that one in 25 Britons have experienced it. A further one in 14 said they would be open to exploring it. Continue reading...",

The findings, from the UK’s fertility watchdog, mean that about 40,000 people a year wanting to conceive are spending money on acupuncture, supplements and drugs, even though they are largely unproven. Some patients are facing increasingly long waits for care, of up to two years, especially for NHS fertility treatment. 51% of patients who used donor sperm got it from abroad, where rules on the maximum number of families that can be created by one donor are looser than in the UK. While 73% of patients are satisfied with their fertility treatment, Asian and black patients are less likely to be satisfied. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/26/wednesday-briefing-first-edition-white-house-security-leak-mike-waltz",
    "description": "In today’s newsletter: After a blunder exposes top officials sharing war plans on a private group chat, questions are being asked about secrecy, protocol … and sheer incompetence Good morning. Look, it could happen to anyone: I well remember, for example, the time I added my mum to a thread with my siblings discussing what to get her for Christmas. On the other hand, I don’t have a secure communications facility in my house for when I need to get something out on the family group chat. Also, we rarely digress from pictures of cute kids to setting out war plans for an imminent set of airstrikes on the Houthis in Yemen. So perhaps the latest Trump administration hullabaloo isn’t that relatable, after all. Two days after the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that he had been mystifyingly added to a thread on Signal – an encrypted WhatsApp-like instant messaging app – in which vice-president JD Vance, defence secretary Pete Hegseth, and a host of others chatted about a highly sensitive operation, there are as many questions as answers. How on earth did Goldberg get added in the first place? Why didn’t anybody realise the error? Are White House officials doing this all the time? And how vulnerable are their communications to interception from America’s adversaries? Spring statement | Rachel Reeves will make additional welfare cuts in her spring statement on Wednesday after the Office for Budget Responsibility rejected her estimate of savings from the changes announced last week. The chancellor is expected to announce an additional £500m in benefits cuts to make up part of the £1.6bn shortfall. Ukraine | Russia and Ukraine have agreed to “eliminate the use of force” in the Black Sea , though the Kremlin said it was conditional on sanctions relief for its agricultural exports. The warring parties also agreed to implement a previously announced 30-day halt on attacks against energy networks. Assisted dying | The introduction of assisted dying in England and Wales is likely to be pushed back by a further two years in a delay that supporters fear could mean the law never comes into force. The delay marks the latest major change to the proposals, which have proven deeply contentious in the Commons and beyond. Gaza | Press freedom organisations have condemned the killing of two journalists in Gaza on Monday by the Israeli armed forces. Hossam Shabat, a 23-year-old correspondent for the Al Jazeera Mubasher channel, and Mohammed Mansour, a correspondent for Palestine Today, died in separate targeted airstrikes. Society | Non-monogamous people are just as happy in their relationships as those with only one partner but are not “significantly” more sexually satisfied, research suggests. The authors of a new study said their findings challenged what they called a prevailing “one-size-fits-all approach to relationships”. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Chappell Roan dresses minimalist in private to separate life and work. Erika Goldring/WireImage Chappell Roan said she dresses in earthy, muted tones and &#34;very modest&#34; clothes in private. In a Call Her Daddy episode, she said she used to dress &#34;crazy&#34; before becoming famous. But then wild outfits became part of her job, and she needed a separation between work and life. Chappell Roan , known onstage for her colorful drag-inspired outfits and makeup, said her style is much more muted when she&#39;s out and about in private. In a podcast episode of &#34;Call Her Daddy,&#34; released on Tuesday, the pop star said she dresses in a &#34;very modest&#34; way when she isn&#39;t performing. She&#39;s also &#34;not in a lot of color&#34; on a daily basis. &#34;I&#39;m in a lot of blacks and a lot of like taupes, and whites, and creams,&#34; Roan said to host Alexandra Cooper. She said that she used to dress &#34;crazy&#34; even off-stage before she became famous. But Roan, whose real name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, said that dressing in wild outfits is now part of her job, and she wants to make sure there is a difference between her work self and her private self. &#34;I would be out as Kayleigh in that, and then I would be onstage as that, and then there was like no separation,&#34; Roan said, referring to her colorful, maximalist stage outfits. Roan is known for her daring wardrobe choices, from her latex wrestler bodysuit at Lollapalooza in August to her chainmail dress at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. Dressing inconspicuously in private is one of several ways the star has tried to separate work from life . She&#39;s publicly slammed fans who overstep boundaries, stalk her, and get upset when denied a selfie or a hug. &#34;I don&#39;t care that abuse and harassment, stalking, whatever, is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous,&#34; she said in a viral TikTok in August. &#34;That does not make it OK, that doesn&#39;t make it normal,&#34; Roan, 27, added. She also withdrew from the &#34;All Things Go&#34; music festival in September to prioritize her health, just about a day before the first of her two performances there. A representative for Roan did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/home-listings-real-estate-agents-hidden-clear-cooperation-decision-nar-2025-3",
    "description": "Chris Gash for BI Shopping for homes online once had the feel of an open-air market: crowded and sweaty, maybe, but free for anyone to drop by and see what&#39;s for sale. The experience these days, though, is quickly turning into that of a nightclub, with the hottest new listings sequestered behind velvet ropes. If you want to party with the cool kids &mdash; in this case, score access to homes before regular folks &mdash; you better know a guy. The wide-open nature of the housing market has been breaking down for a while. Most real estate agents have traditionally taken a maximalist approach to marketing homes, sharing listings widely through local databases known as multiple listing services . Agents browse the MLS to get details on homes available for sale, while search portals like Zillow pull the data onto their own websites for regular home shoppers to scroll through. The thinking is simple: More eyes on a listing means more potential bidders , giving a homeowner the best chance of selling quickly and lucratively. This model is even backstopped by the National Association of Realtors, a powerful industry group that sets the rules for most MLSes around the country. NAR instituted a rule in 2020 known as the clear cooperation policy , which says that once a real estate agent starts marketing a home publicly &mdash; on a website, through an email blast, or even with a &#34;for sale&#34; sign in the front yard &mdash; they must list it on the MLS within one day. The rule was meant to prevent freeloading and encourage participation in the MLS, keeping listings in one place for other agents and their clients to see. In recent years, however, the clear cooperation rule has been challenged by some of the biggest players in the game, who want to act as the new bouncers for VIP rooms filled with exclusive home listings. In particular, Compass, the country&#39;s largest real estate brokerage by sales volume, wants to take charge of the aforementioned velvet rope. Compass agents are increasingly hoarding their listings internally, shunning the MLS and making homes available only to buyers who work with other Compass agents. The company&#39;s founder and CEO, Robert Reffkin , has also been crusading against the clear cooperation policy. Reffkin argues that sellers should reject the one-size-fits-all approach of the MLS and exert more control over how their home is marketed. His campaign has stoked fierce infighting among real estate agents and raised a fundamental question: Who should be able to see the homes for sale in the US? For now, the fight is ongoing. After months of debate, NAR said Tuesday it would leave the clear cooperation policy intact while adding another rule that functions as a small concession to Compass. The apparent attempt at compromise will probably end up pleasing no one. But while clear cooperation remains in place for now, the housing market continues to hurtle toward a decidedly un cooperative future. Those in favor of clear cooperation argue the rule is responsible for America&#39;s uniquely transparent housing market &mdash; the reason you can hop on Zillow or Realtor.com and get the lay of the land. The policy was supposed to stem the rise of so-called &#34;pocket listings,&#34; homes marketed for sale but unavailable on the MLS. If agents stop contributing listings to the shared databases, many in the industry warn, a once unified housing market could break up into silos, with home listings distributed among clubby groups of brokers known as &#34;private listing networks&#34; or gatekept within brokerages like Compass. Everybody benefits when we all pool our listings, and we do so in a timely manner. And people are hurt, potentially, when we don&#39;t do that. In this world, some agents will have access to a lot more properties than others. Pick the wrong rep , and you could unknowingly miss out on your dream home. And while there are good reasons someone might not want their house touted on the MLS &mdash; a celebrity like Brad Pitt, for instance, probably doesn&#39;t want their business aired out for everyone to see &mdash; conventional wisdom says sharing a home widely is the best way to get top dollar. &#34;Everybody benefits when we all pool our listings, and we do so in a timely manner,&#34; Saul Klein, a longtime real estate executive who&#39;s the CEO of the San Diego Multiple Listing Service, previously told me. &#34;And people are hurt, potentially, when we don&#39;t do that.&#34; But it&#39;s become increasingly clear that the advocates for the open system are losing. Yes, NAR kept the clear cooperation rule in place, but it also introduced an option for privacy-conscious sellers to list on the MLS while delaying their listings from popping up on sites like Zillow or the landing pages for other brokerages. The idea is to give sellers more flexibility to market their homes as they see fit, catering to those who may prefer to &#34;premarket&#34; their home before blasting it out widely. The move doesn&#39;t go nearly as far as Compass would have liked, but the company still frames this as a validation of its rallying cry for more seller choice. &#34;With NAR introducing a new MLS policy to &#39;expand choice for consumers,&#39; they acknowledged the clear cooperation policy restricted home seller choice,&#34; Reffkin said in a statement. &#34;Expanding choice means that NAR is still not letting homeowners choose precisely how to market their homes, but this is a small step in the right direction.&#34; Compass may not be totally happy with NAR&#39;s most recent decision, but the company has already succeeded in shaking up the real estate landscape. The brokerage has made plenty of hay by exploiting a glaring loophole in the clear cooperation rules. While an agent has to add the listing to the MLS database once they publicly put the home up for sale , the rule allows agents to share new properties within their brokerages without adding them to the MLS. This method, which Compass dubbed the &#34;Private Exclusive&#34; route, essentially creates a walled garden with homes that can&#39;t be found anywhere else. Compass drives traffic to its website, collects a commission from both sides of the deal, and can lure both agents and clients by offering access to its inventory. Private exclusives have become a key strategy for the brokerage giant: Reffkin told analysts in February that 35% of the company&#39;s active listings nationwide were only available by working with a Compass agent or visiting Compass.com. This isn&#39;t just some self-serving maneuver, either, Compass execs argue. They say sellers benefit from spurning the MLS and marketing their homes within the safe confines of the Compass network. The MLS and search portals like Zillow show how long a house has been on the market and whether the price has been slashed, data points that buyers can use to put pressure on homeowners in negotiations . The Compass website doesn&#39;t show price cuts or days on the market, theoretically allowing a seller to test their ideal price without any repercussions if they have to backtrack. And if they don&#39;t sell that way, they can always turn to the MLS and go the conventional route for maximum exposure. Compass likens this strategy to beta testing a product with a smaller audience before launch. &#34;We firmly believe that homeowners should have full control and flexibility in choosing how they market their home, period, full stop,&#34; Ashton Alexander, the head of strategy at Compass, tells me. Brian Boero, the CEO of 1000Watt, a brand and marketing agency for real estate companies, doesn&#39;t buy it. Compass, he says, is really after control. Under the existing rule, the company may be free to pursue its &#34;Private Exclusives&#34; strategy, but it can&#39;t, for instance, publicly market a home on its website without also contributing to the MLS. &#34;They want to make Compass.com a destination where they control the inventory publicly, and they want to have free rein to continue to expand their private listings program,&#34; Boero tells me. &#34;So they didn&#39;t get what they wanted.&#34; Everybody loses here, in a way. Nobody&#39;s happy. Compass is far from the only large brokerage to employ this kind of strategy &mdash; Coldwell Banker, for instance, has &#34;Exclusive Look,&#34; Howard Hanna has &#34;Find It First,&#34; and one large Keller Williams franchise, KW Go, has dubbed its offering &#34;Private Collection.&#34; More companies have threatened to follow the lead and keep listings off the MLS if it helps them compete for agents and clients. The clear cooperation policy has always been tough to enforce, too, with the onus placed on local MLSes to keep agents in line. Some MLSes, fearing litigation, have already backed off enforcement, tacitly allowing agents to market homes however they like. This could enable private listing networks &mdash; groups of typically high-achieving agents from different brokerages who share off-MLS listings among each other &mdash; to flourish. NAR&#39;s decision to keep clear cooperation is a small victory for those who favor the status quo, but it will hardly end the practices fracturing the housing market. Compass hasn&#39;t ruled out the possibility of litigation over the rule, either. For now, the real estate industry is stuck in a sort of limbo. No one doubts that secret listings will continue to rise, but the fight over the clear cooperation policy isn&#39;t going anywhere. &#34;Everybody loses here, in a way,&#34; Boero tells me. &#34;Nobody&#39;s happy.&#34; James Rodriguez is a senior reporter on Business Insider&#39;s Discourse team.

    "description": "Richard Maas retired two years ago but wants to return to work. Richard Maas Richard Maas, 89, retired at 87 but wants to return to work. He worked in the auto industry for five decades including running an appraisal company for 20 years. Maas retired because the work was physically demanding, and he&#39;s found retirement boring. Richard Maas, 89, just wants to go back to work . Maas, who lives in Tempe, Arizona, worked in the automobile industry for over five decades, including running an appraisal company into his late 80s. He retired nearly two years ago when the work became too physically demanding, but he said his mind is still fresh &mdash; making him &#34; hate retirement .&#34; In his ideal world, he would keep working until the grave. &#34;At this age without work, there isn&#39;t a hell of a lot to look forward to,&#34; Maas said, adding he worked in his retirement years out of enjoyment and not money. &#34;I feel like whenever you quit working, you don&#39;t feel like you have any purpose. That&#39;s the way I feel right now.&#34; Do you have a story to share about working into your later years? Please fill out this quick Google Form . Over the last few months, Business Insider heard from dozens of older Americans about their decision not to retire , even with the financial means to do so. Many mentioned working to maintain social connections or achieve lifelong goals , while others said the routine simply gives them something to do. Running a company in your 80s Maas began working in insurance for a company owned by General Motors in 1964 and stayed there for over 33 years. He worked as an insurance adjuster, investigating insurance claims to determine the insurer&#39;s liability. Maas said he loved his insurance job because he helped people solve problems every day. He found it fulfilling to guide people on the next steps to protect their vehicles and wallets. He got paid a decent salary during his career and raised two children he and his wife adopted, who now live nearby. &#34;I helped people, the paying customer, and also helped control loss costs for the company I worked for,&#34; Maas said, adding that sense of helpfulness helped him &#34;keep going for 50 years.&#34; After holding various other positions under General Motors, he retired in 1998 but immediately felt empty. &#34;We did some traveling after retiring, and we didn&#39;t end up working a lot,&#34; Maas said, adding he was itching to return to work. He worked briefly with a man he earlier trained, doing appraisals for recreational vehicles. But in 2002, he decided it was time to carry out his dream of being an entrepreneur , forming his own company in his mid-60s. He said he didn&#39;t need the money he got from it, and instead was doing it to continue helping people and stay active. He started an appraisal business that handled insurance claims for various companies. He inspected RVs and trucks for damage caused by an accident to determine costs and help people avoid exorbitant payments. &#34;It was very satisfying work, to tell you the truth, even in my 80s,&#34; Maas said. Begrudgingly retiring He ran his business until nearly two years ago when he said he struggled physically to do the work. He said the strain of assessing damage on vehicles was &#34;more than I thought I should be doing.&#34; &#34;Mind-wise, I haven&#39;t had a whole lot of problems,&#34; Maas said. &#34;Physically, though, the work required getting down under vehicles, and that became too difficult to do.&#34; The adjustment to not working after over five decades in the automobile industry was tough. Maas said he spends his days reading and watching TV, which has lowered his drive to keep working toward the next big goal. He said he hates retirement as a result. He and his wife have been married for 70 years, and they still do everything together. He said marrying his best friend has pushed him to stay motivated while balancing work with family. He added he&#39;s stayed close to friends as he&#39;s gotten older and has encouraged his slightly younger friends not to quit working. &#34;I don&#39;t have regrets,&#34; Maas said. &#34;People need to do the best they can with what they&#39;ve got at all times.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "The Golden Age of private equity is over. Here is what it means for your career.",

    "description": "&nbsp; Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty, MILANTE/Getty, Ava Horton/BI Private equity&#39;s slump continues as the business of buying and selling companies remains sluggish. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades. Here&#39;s what it means for those already in the industry and those eager to break in. Wall Street&#39;s &#34;Barbarians at the Gate&#34; are slowing down after nearly 25 years of beating the stock market. Earlier this month, investment firm Hamilton Lane issued a report showing that the MSCI World Index, a leading stock market indicator, beat out private equity returns for the first time since the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Hamilton Lane&#39;s data represents performance through September 2024 for buyout funds that started investing in 2022. Prior to this, the leveraged buyout industry, also known as private equity, had been on a tear. Sure, it felt some pain during the housing crash and the following recession, but that also meant that interest rates stayed lower for longer &mdash; paving the way for cash-rich companies like Blackstone to pick up assets on the cheap , which helped drive returns and more investors. In July 2023, Blackstone became the first private equity firm to manage $1 trillion in assets &mdash; three years ahead of the company&#39;s prediction to investors. Hamilton Lane charts tracking internal rate of return of private investment funds compared to their public market equivalents. Hamilton Lane As Apollo CEO Marc Rowan said at a presentation last year, much of the industry&#39;s returns over the last 15 years (he excluded Apollo&#39;s) &#34;was not the result of great investing, but as a result of $1 trillion in money printing. Well, guess what? We stopped printing that magnitude of money.&#34; Indeed, since interest rates started ticking higher, financial sponsor dealmaking has slowed, IPOs have ground to a halt , and dry powder (industry speak for money yet to be invested) has stood at near all-time highs even as fundraising slowed by almost half from its 2021 peak. That&#39;s not to say that the industry broadly known as &#34;private equity&#34; is dead &mdash;&nbsp;or that all buyout funds have underperformed stocks in recent years. Quite the opposite. Firms like Blackstone and Apollo have been busy issuing loans and investing in large infrastructure projects (think data centers). Indeed, Apollo&#39;s lending business is now nearly 10 times larger than its traditional buyout business. What does it all mean for budding masters of the universe looking for a career in private equity? We spoke with a range of experts, from industry insiders to consultants and recruiters, to understand what is ahead for professionals looking to break into the lucrative field of private-market investing. &#34;Private equity was able to get lazy because of ZIRP.&#34; They said there is no shortage of opportunities for aspiring financiers who know where to look. Private equity&#39;s loss has been private credit&#39;s gain, and within private equity, there are more opportunities than ever for pure-play operations experts skilled at running businesses. As Robin Judson, founder of recruiting firm Robin Judson Partners, put it: &#34;I think that people who want to do private equity will pursue it, while people who just want to invest may look toward other strategies.&#34; Here&#39;s a guide to a career in private equity as the golden age of corporate buybacks gives way to private credit and other types of dealmaking. The rise of the portfolio operator When interest rates started rising in 2022, company valuations remained loft, making it harder for buyout firms, which rely heavily on debt to make purchases, to find deals that could generate returns. This has led to a shift in demand for professionals who know how to drive returns by changing how a business is run, said Glenn Mincey, KPMG&#39;s head of US private equity. &#34;This recalibration has given professionals in the industry new focus outside of buying and selling companies,&#34; Mincey told BI. Indeed, these pros used to be called in to help manage a company after it was purchased. Increasingly, they are getting involved in advance of an acquisition because they are often best positioned to know how to maximize performance through operational improvements. The largest firms will hire teams of operational experts with expertise ranging from technological transformation to supply chain and logistics to talent acquisition and management. Even traditional deal professionals have become more operationally focused. &#34;Private equity was able to get lazy because of ZIRP,&#34; a VP at a mid-market private equity firm told BI, referring to the acronym for the Federal Reserve&#39;s zero interest rate policy response to financial crises starting in 2001. &#34;That&#39;s gone away, you have to know your shit now,&#34; this person added. This hands-on, entrepreneurial approach can be seen in the growing rise of so-called search funds. Sometimes described as mini-private equity, a search fund is a small private equity fund run by one or two individuals that&#39;s focused on purchasing one small business like a carwash or HVAC company. Once purchased, the fund works on streamlining operations and creating value. According to a 2024 Stanford Business School study , search fund creation hit an all-time high in 2023, the latest year with data, with more than 90 first-time search funds raised. This strategy is attracting a younger group of professionals right out of business school, or even before business school, with Stanford finding that nearly 80% of first-time fundraisers in 2023 clock in at 35 or younger. The private credit boom The same high interest rates and global uncertainty that have dampened the traditional private equity industry have made nonbank lending, also known as private credit, more attractive. Even in a tough economy, &#34;companies still need capitalization,&#34; explained Judson. And with banks pulling back on riskier lending, private investors have stepped in to offer &#34;more creative financing solutions,&#34; she said. Blackstone, which made its name in private equity and then real estate investing, saw its credit business grow to become the largest business in its portfolio by assets under management last year. Apollo now counts more than 80% of its $751 billion in assets under management as private credit. As PWC&#39;s leader of its private equity advisory practice Kevin Desai told BI in January, the private credit job market is hot in part because there simply aren&#39;t enough people with direct experience to fill lenders&#39; needs. One reason is that private credit firms want professionals with lending experience. That means recruiting from the debt-raising or trading arms of investment banks &mdash; or really anyone with lending knowledge who can be trained. Nelson Chu, CEO and founder of private credit investment marketplace Percent , told BI that his firm has also recruited talent from debt rating agencies like Morningstar and Moody&#39;s. Its often worked out so well that the firm has seen its workers get quickly poached after they get up to speed, he added. What this means for private equity jobs Anthony Keizner, cofounder and managing partner of Odyssey Search Partners, told BI that hiring is &#34;very buoyant&#34; in certain private equity businesses, including the popular and dry-powder-rich niches of secondaries, buying and selling of stakes in other private funds, and infrastructure. This chart compares the performance of private funds that started investing in 2022 to their public market equivalents. Note the outsized performance of infrastructure. Hamilton Lane The slowdown in the traditional private equity business of buyouts is felt most acutely in midlevel and senior positions, he said. &#34;Most buyout firms have slowed their hiring plans in 2025 compared to the recent boom years,&#34; he said. &#34;Many private equity firms feel they are adequately staffed at current deal volume levels.&#34; Hiring at the junior level remains active, he said &mdash; a sentiment echoed by Tim Roth, partner at advisory firm Armanino Advisory. &#34;I don&#39;t believe junior hiring is decreasing, but I think it&#39;s becoming more competitive to get a shot,&#34; Roth told BI, noting that AI could exacerbate the challenge. For professionals who have already broken into the business, there&#39;s less pay but not a lot of eagerness to jump ship either. One reason is that PE firms still have a ton of dry powder to invest and portfolio companies to sell when the time is right. &#34;I tell candidates not to leave their jobs right now without having another job,&#34; Judson said. &#34;If you have a job, assuming the portfolio is sustainable, you will eventually get paid.&#34; The private equity VP agreed. &#34;I haven&#39;t heard of many people at my level looking to run for the exits,&#34; he told BI. Even with realizations, and therefore carry and bonuses lower, the industry still offers &#34;the highest upside&#34; for compensation, he explained. Private equity, with its tie to interest rates and the overall health of the economy, is a cyclical business. Previous golden ages, like the 1980s or the early 2000s, also ended, and new ones rose up in their stead. &#34;The key word right now is stagnation,&#34; Judson said. &#34;Nobody knows how long this uncertainty is going to last. Is it going to last for months or years?&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Making AI agents smart isn't the hard part &mdash; it's teaching them company culture, says a Goldman Sachs exec",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-marco-argenti-companies-culture-ai-agents-2025-3",
    "description": "Goldman Sachs; Chelsea Jia Feng/BI Goldman Sachs&#39; Marco Argenti said businesses need to integrate company culture into AI agents. The tech industry has mostly focused on the &#34;specialization of expertise,&#34; he said. AI agents &mdash; AI that acts independently &mdash; are a hot topic in tech. Goldman Sachs&#39; chief information officer said the real challenge of using AI agents in the workplace isn&#39;t just making them smarter &mdash; it&#39;s teaching them company culture. Marco Argenti said on an episode of the Goldman Sachs Exchanges podcast published Tuesday that businesses must figure out how to &#34;inject&#34; their cultural traits and leadership principles into AI agents, just as they do with human employees. The tech industry has mostly focused on the &#34;specialization of expertise,&#34; he said. But it doesn&#39;t talk much about the &#34;enhancement of the cultural aspect of agents,&#34; which he said is crucial for managing AI in the workplace. AI agents &mdash; AI that can act and make decisions independently &mdash; are a hot topic in tech and the workforce. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in January that &#34;the age of agentic AI is here&#34; and said last year that Nvidia&#39;s 50,000-person staff could work with 100 million agents. OpenAI&#39;s Sam Altman predicted that AI agents could start entering the workforce this year. AI agents are intended to be digital coworkers or assistants to human workers in fields ranging from healthcare and supply chain management to cybersecurity and customer service. Argenti warned that without cultural training, these agents risk missing the nuances that define an organization&#39;s identity. Comparing AI agents to new hires, Argenti said they might become more intelligent over time but won&#39;t automatically become culturally smarter. Businesses must figure out how to embed their unique identity into AI agents so they can interpret work through the company&#39;s lens and communicate in its language. For instance, he said, an AI agent summarizing portfolio analysis in private wealth management at Goldman Sachs needs to apply a &#34;Goldman lens&#34; to its answers. That means translating financial content in a way that aligns with the firm&#39;s approach. &#34;Cultures are very peculiar,&#34; Argenti added. &#34;They&#39;re hard to describe, but you see them when you see them.&#34; Argenti acknowledged that he does not know what culturally trained agents look like in practice, asking, &#34;What are the actual leadership principles or tenets that an effective corporate agent should adhere to in order to fit into the culture of an organization?&#34; His answer: &#34;That&#39;s a very complex problem that I don&#39;t think has been solved yet.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "Ray Dalio said the US budget deficit needs to be cut to about 3% of GDP so that debt servicing costs will not &#34;severely squeeze out the government&#39;s ability to spend.&#34; Dia Dipasupil via Getty Images Ray Dalio met with House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington and House Republicans on Tuesday. Dalio told lawmakers to cut the budget deficit to about 3% of GDP. Dalio has repeatedly warned of the economic dangers that come with soaring deficits. Ray Dalio , the founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates , said he had a discussion with House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington and other House Republicans about the national debt on Tuesday. &#34;I appreciate our ability to have a frank apolitical discussion about the mechanics behind how countries go broke as it applies to the circumstances at hand,&#34; Dalio said in a statement about the meeting on Tuesday. Arrington thanked Dalio for meeting with them, adding that Dalio had &#34;sounded the alarm to Members of Congress on the urgent need to address our unsustainable and exponentially growing borrowing and spending.&#34; Dalio said in his statement that there was a &#34;pretty broad recognition&#34; among attendees that the budget deficit needs to be cut to around 3% of the country&#39;s GDP. Dalio added that this cut will ensure that debt servicing costs do not &#34;squeeze out the government&#39;s ability to spend.&#34; &#34;I look forward to staying in touch about these issues and having similar discussions with others so that there are realistic assessments of the issues and what might be done to deal with them,&#34; Dalio said. Dalio has previously sounded warnings about the economic dangers of soaring debt levels. Last month, Dalio said in an interview at the World Governments Summit in Dubai that America could suffer the financial equivalent of a &#34;heart attack&#34; if it didn&#39;t reduce its deficit spending. &#34;Waiting too long is like ignoring plaque buildup until a heart attack occurs,&#34; Dalio said in February. The federal government collected $4.92 trillion in revenue in the 2024 fiscal year but spent about $6.75 trillion. That created a deficit of $1.83 trillion &mdash; a $138 billion increase in debt from the previous fiscal year. Dalio said in an interview on Bloomberg&#39;s &#34;Odd Lots&#34; podcast, which aired earlier this month that the US could face a debt crisis in the next three years if it didn&#39;t act fast. &#34;If you don&#39;t do that, then you own it, OK? You have to take responsibility for the consequences,&#34; Dalio told Bloomberg. &#34;When the economy and this heart attack of sorts comes along, then you&#39;re going to find yourself that the voters are not going to be very happy. So you own it,&#34; he continued. A representative for Dalio did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "CoreWeave is on the cusp of a huge IPO &mdash; but it could face an expensive hardware problem",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/coreweave-ipo-nvidia-gpu-hopper-problem-blackwell-ai-depreciation-2025-3",
    "description": "Michael Intrator, the CEO of CoreWeave, is on the cusp of a big initial public offering. Bruno de Carvalho/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Rapid AI advancements may reduce the useful life of CoreWeave&#39;s Hopper-based Nvidia GPUs. CoreWeave has a lot of Hopper-based GPUs, which are becoming outdated due to the Blackwell rollout. Amazon recently cut the estimated useful life of its servers, citing AI advancements. I recently wrote about Nvidia &#39;s latest AI chip-and-server package and how this new advancement may dent the value of the previous product. Nvidia&#39;s new offering likely caused Amazon to reduce the useful life of its AI servers, which took a big chunk out of earnings. Other Big Tech companies, such as Microsoft, Google, and Meta, may have to take similar tough medicine, according to analysts. This issue might also impact Nvidia-backed CoreWeave , a startup that&#39;s planning one of the biggest tech IPO s in years. CoreWeave is a so-called neocloud, specializing in generative AI workloads that rely mostly on Nvidia GPUs and servers. Like its bigger rivals, CoreWeave has been buying oodles of Nvidia GPUs and renting them out over the internet. The startup had deployed more than 250,000 GPUs by the end of 2024, per its filing to go public. These are incredibly valuable assets. Tech companies and startups have been jostling for the right to buy Nvidia GPUs in recent years, so any company that has amassed a quarter of a million of these components has done very well. There&#39;s a problem, though. AI technology is advancing so rapidly that it can make existing gear obsolete, or at least less useful, more quickly. This is happening now as Nvidia rolls out its latest AI chip-and-server package, Blackwell . It&#39;s notably better than the previous version, Hopper, which came out in 2022. Veteran tech analyst Ross Sandler recently shared a chart showing that the cost of renting older Hopper-based GPUs has plummeted as the newer Blackwell GPUs become more available. A chart showing the cost of renting Nvidia H100 GPUs Ross Sandler/Barclays Capital The majority of CoreWeave&#39;s deployed GPUs are based on the older Hopper architecture, according to its latest IPO filing from March 20. Sometimes, in situations like this,&nbsp;companies have to adjust their financials to reflect the quickly changing product landscape. This is done by reducing the estimated useful life of the assets in question. Then, through depreciation, the value of assets is reduced over a short time period to reflect things like wear and tear and, ultimately, obsolescence. The faster the depreciation, the bigger the hit to earnings. Amazon&#39;s AI-powered depreciation Amazon, the world&#39;s largest cloud provider, just did this. On a recent conference call with analysts, the company &#34;observed an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.&#34; That caused Amazon Web Services to decrease the useful life of some of its servers and networking gear from six years to five years, beginning in January. Sandler, the Barclays analyst, thinks other tech companies may have to do the same, which could cut operating income by billions of dollars. Will CoreWeave have to do the same, just as it&#39;s trying to pull off one of the biggest tech IPOs in years? I asked a CoreWeave spokeswoman about this, but she declined to comment. This is not unusual, because companies in the midst of IPOs have to follow strict rules that limit what they can say publicly.&nbsp; CoreWeave&#39;s IPO risk factor CoreWeave talks about this issue in its latest IPO filing, writing that the company is always upgrading its platform, which includes replacing old equipment. &#34;This requires us to make certain estimates with respect to the useful life of the components of our infrastructure and to maximize the value of the components of our infrastructure, including our GPUs, to the fullest extent possible.&#34; The company warned those estimates could be inaccurate. CoreWeave said its calculations involve a host of assumptions that could change and infrastructure upgrades that might not go according to plan &mdash; all of which could affect the company, now and later. This caution is normal because companies have to detail everything that could hit their bottom line, from pandemics to cybersecurity attacks. As recently as January 2023, CoreWeave was taking the opposite approach to this situation, according to its IPO filing. The company increased the estimated useful life of its computing gear from five years to six years.&nbsp;That change reduced expenses by $20 million and boosted earnings by 10 cents a share for the 2023 year. If the company now follows AWS and reduces the useful life of its gear, that might dent earnings. Again, CoreWeave&#39;s spokeswoman declined to comment, citing IPO rules. An important caveat: Just because one giant cloud provider made an adjustment like this, it doesn&#39;t mean others will have to do the same. CoreWeave might design its AI data centers differently, somehow making Nvidia GPU systems last longer or become less obsolete less quickly, for instance.&nbsp; It&#39;s&nbsp;also worth noting that other big cloud companies, including Google, Meta, and Microsoft, have increased the estimated useful life of their data center equipment in recent years. Google and Microsoft&#39;s current estimates are six years, like CoreWeave&#39;s, while Meta&#39;s is 5.5 years. However, Sandler, the Barclays analyst, thinks some of these big companies will follow AWS and shorten these estimates.&nbsp; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Taiwan has a new all-purpose sea attack drone after watching how Ukraine smashed Russia's Black Sea Fleet",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-unveils-sea-drone-after-seeing-ukraine-beat-russias-fleet-2025-3",
    "description": "CSBC has unveiled the Endeavor Manta, a small, five-ton uncrewed surface vessel that&#39;s meant to fire torpedoes or be used as an exploding drone. CSBC Corporation Taiwan has a new sea drone that it says can fire torpedoes or ram enemies with explosives. It&#39;s a small versatile craft that adds to Taipei&#39;s arsenal for countering a Chinese invasion. Its manufacturer said the Endeavor Manta was inspired by Ukraine&#39;s success against the Black Sea Fleet. A Taiwanese shipbuilding firm has debuted a new uncrewed surface vessel that it said was inspired by Ukraine&#39;s attacks on Russia&#39;s Black Sea Fleet. Named the Endeavor Manta, the 28-foot-long sea drone is meant to fire light torpedoes and ram into targets with explosives on its bow, the Taiwan International Shipbuilding Corporation, or CSBC, said on Tuesday. The drone&#39;s debut comes as Taiwan has pushed hard into designing, purchasing, and building more uncrewed vehicles to potentially counter any aggression from China. Should Beijing seek to take the self-governed island by force, the effort would likely require sending troops on a perilous amphibious assault across the 110-mile Taiwan Strait. CSBC said the Endeavor Manta was built with versatility in mind: It&#39;s designed to be launched at any port or beach in Taiwan and can be carried on the back of a commercial truck. The firm touted the Endeavor Manta as an all-purpose platform that can be used as a port inspector, loitering munition, drone jammer, mine-hunter, recon vehicle, decoy, short-range air defense, or even a mothership for smaller drones. &#34;In severe weather or maritime accidents, it assists with firefighting, search and rescue, and emergency supply transportation,&#34; the firm added, publishing a concept image of the drone spitting water on a burning ship. Per CSBC, the Endeavor Manta can be controlled using 4G, satellite, and radio signals, and can return autonomously to its launch point or self-destruct if it&#39;s jammed or hijacked. The Endeavor Manta reaches a speed of up to 35 knots, CSBC said. CSBC Corporation The Endeavor Manta has a fiber-reinforced plastic hull and displaces about five tons of water, so it&#39;s a relatively small naval craft. By comparison, Taiwan&#39;s Anping-class patrol boats displace about 600 tons, while its Cheng-Kung-class light frigates displace around 3,200 tons. CSBC said its new drone can also reach a top speed of 35 knots, or roughly 40 miles per hour. Given the vessel&#39;s size, it&#39;s highly likely any torpedo would have to be fitted externally. Images of the Endeavor Manta on display at Kaohsiung&#39;s Singda Port show that several of its sensors and cameras are mounted on a raised platform above the drone&#39;s hull. CSBC&#39;s new sea drone is mounted with several external cameras and sensors. Its chairman, Huang Zhenghong, is pictured here next to the Endeavor Manta. CSBC Corporation While CSBC said the drone was &#34;influenced by the Ukraine-Russia War,&#34; the Taiwan Strait&#39;s waters can be choppier than in the Black Sea. To give the Endeavor Manta more stability, it designed the drone with a trimaran hull. Based on footage released by CSBC of the Endeavor Manta, the drone appears to have a cabin and steering controls for a pilot if needed. CSBC&#39;s chairman, Huang Zhenghong, told local TV that the drone is built with a &#34;red-free&#34; supply chain, meaning it contains no components from mainland China. The Endeavor Manta joins a growing Taiwanese arsenal of sea and aerial drones aimed at frustrating a Chinese amphibious invasion. Ukraine&#39;s own successes against Russia&#39;s Black Sea Fleet, which it crippled through sea drone attacks and long-range strikes, have been a stark demonstration of how uncrewed vehicles can be effective against a traditional navy that&#39;s stronger on paper. Over a third of the fleet has been destroyed since 2022. Taipei and Washington have been closely watching the Black Sea battle. Adm. Samuel Paparo, who leads the US Indo-Pacific Command, said in June that he wanted to turn the Taiwan Strait into an&nbsp; &#34;unmanned hellscape&#34; &nbsp;that could buy Taiwan a month for the US to respond to any Chinese aggression. That same month, Taiwanese media reported that local shipbuilding company Jong Shyn was using a 20-ton uncrewed vessel as a test platform for building exploding sea drones and other tools. Tensions between China and Taiwan have continued to worsen as Beijing says it won&#39;t rule out annexing the island by force and repeatedly conducts military exercises threatening Taipei. Meanwhile, Taiwan&#39;s people in 2024 once again elected leaders from the Democratic Progressive Party , which has staunchly campaigned against resisting China.

    "description": "Moxie Marlinspike, aka Matthew Rosenfeld, is the founder and former CEO of Signal. Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch Signal&#39;s founder, Moxie Marlinspike, poked fun at the military group-chat leak in a post on X. He used the incident as an opportunity to ironically promote the platform. US officials, however, have expressed alarm over the security breach. A major security leak involving the secure messaging platform Signal sparked widespread alarm throughout the country &mdash; but the platform&#39;s founder didn&#39;t appear very concerned. In a post on X on Monday afternoon, Moxie Marlinspike, whose real name is Matthew Rosenfeld, poked fun at the group message leak and used it to ironically promote the &#34;many great reasons to be on Signal.&#34; &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations,&#34; the founder of the platform and its former CEO wrote in the post.

Marlinspike&#39;s reaction is in sharp contrast to that of that of Democratic and Republican officials, many of whom expressed alarm at the security leak. Republican Sen.

Jim Risch of Idaho said Tuesday there will be an investigation into the incident, The Hill reported . Marlinspike wasn&#39;t the only social media user to poke fun at the snafu. However, comments on his post were mixed, with some blaming the officials who made the mistake and others saying that the platform should improve its security. On Tuesday, Signal wrote in an X post that there has been &#34;misinfo flying around that might drive people away from Signal and private communications.&#34; Signal cited a Tuesday report from NPR in its post. In its report, NPR said it obtained a Pentagon email from March 18, warning employees about a potential Signal vulnerability. &#34;The memo used the term &#39;vulnerability&#39; in relation to Signal&mdash;but it had nothing to do with Signal&#39;s core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users,&#34; Signal wrote on X. Right now there are a lot of new eyes on Signal, and not all of them are familiar with secure messaging and its nuances. Which means there’s misinfo flying around that might drive people away from Signal and private communications. One piece of misinfo we need to address is the… &mdash; Signal (@signalapp) March 25, 2025 &#34;Phishing isn&#39;t new, and it&#39;s not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal&#39;s underlying technology. Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites,&#34; the company continued. Signal is a nonprofit, open-sourced, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform that has emerged as one of the most popular messaging apps over the last few years. Only recipients can see messages, so it&#39;s commonly used by journalists, government officials, and tech giants. Signal and Marlinspike did not respond to requests for comment from BI.

    "description": "ChatGPT has a new image generator feature that can create images from users&#39; text prompts. Jaque Silva/NurPhoto ChatGPT released an image generator on Tuesday. A software engineer on X said they discovered that the feature had trouble creating images of &#34;sexy women.&#34; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it was a &#34;bug&#34; that will be fixed. ChatGPT&#39;s new image generator appeared to have a bug that only allowed the AI tool to create images of &#34;sexy men.&#34; An X user who identified themself as a software engineer pointed out the issue on Tuesday, shortly after the feature was unveiled. The image generator is a new function of ChatGPT that allows users to create elaborate images from detailed prompts. &#34;New ChatGPT image gen can draw sexy men but not sexy women,&#34; the user wrote, posting a screenshot of ChatGPT&#39;s response, which said, &#34;The difference comes down to context and how content is interpreted in terms of sexualization and objectification, especially when it involves women.&#34; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded that image generation of sexy women &#34;should be allowed&#34; and that it was a &#34;bug&#34; that will be fixed. &#34;Hot guy though!&#34; Altman added. ChatGPT appeared to have no issues generating an image of a &#34;hot woman&#34; when prompted by Business Insider. ChatGPT can now create images of humans through detailed prompts. Screenshot of ChatGPT The image generator does have restrictions around creating images of real people . When Business Insider continued the prompt requesting an image of Sam Altman, ChatGPT responded that it couldn&#39;t generate an exact image of the CEO but could instead create a &#34;character inspired by his features with a unique, artistic twist.&#34; ChatGPT&#39;s new image generator has content restrictions regarding generating images of real people. Screenshot of ChatGPT OpenAI said in its announcement of the feature that there are &#34;heightened restrictions&#34; on requests for images of real people, especially when they involve nudity or graphic violence. In an addendum explaining the new feature, the company said it won&#39;t outright block the capability of generating images of adult public figures. This allows for the &#34;possibility of helpful and beneficial uses in areas like educational, historical, satirical and political speech,&#34; OpenAI said. Public figures can, however, opt their image out of this feature, the company said. An OpenAI spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-war-big-law-targets-jenner-block-firm-resists-2025-3",
    "description": "Donald Trump on Tuesday signed his latest executive order targeting a Big Law firm, this time taking aim at Jenner &amp; Block. Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images Donald Trump on Tuesday signed his latest executive order targeting a Big Law firm, Jenner &amp; Block. The order is similar to one against Perkins Coie, which a federal judge blocked as unconstitutional. Jenner &amp; Block, in a statement, said the firm remains focused on serving its clients despite the order. Jenner &amp; Block on Tuesday became the latest target in President Donald Trump&#39;s war on Big Law after he issued an executive order revoking its attorneys&#39; security clearances and ordering a review of the firm&#39;s government contracts. But Jenner signaled it doesn&#39;t plan to back down without a fight. The firm, headquartered in Chicago, employs over 400 attorneys across six offices nationwide and is the fourth major law firm targeted by the Trump administration with similar executive actions. Each of the firms &mdash;&nbsp; Paul Weiss , Perkins Coie, and Covington &amp; Burling &mdash; has had ties to Trump&#39;s political opponents. In the Tuesday order, Trump specifically singled out attorney Andrew Weissmann, a Jenner employee who served as a lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller&#39;s Special Counsel&#39;s Office, which investigated Trump&#39;s ties to Russia in 2016. The order described Weissmann&#39;s career as &#34;rooted in weaponized government and abuse of power.&#34; &#34;Jenner &amp; Block has had a long history representing clients, paid and pro bono, in their most difficult matters since 1914,&#34; Jenner &amp; Block said in a statement released after the order was issued. &#34;Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court. We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients&#39; interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.&#34; US District Judge Beryl Howell on March 12 partially blocked Trump&#39;s order against Perkins Coie. Politico reported that during an emergency hearing, the judge said that the &#34;retaliatory animus&#34; of Trump&#39;s order against the firm was &#34;clear on its face&#34; and &#34;runs head-on into the wall of First Amendment protections.&#34; On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion to disqualify Howell from overseeing the lawsuit, arguing the judge is &#34;insufficiently impartial&#34; to rule on the case. While Perkins Coie fights the executive order in court, another targeted firm has taken a contrasting approach to handling Trump&#39;s actions against it. Instead of challenging the order&#39;s legality, Paul Weiss agreed to reevaluate its hiring practices in alignment with Trump&#39;s anti-DEI initiatives and provide $40 million in pro bono legal work to further causes identified by the Trump administration, such as combating antisemitism and assisting veterans. Trump rescinded the order against Paul Weiss after the agreement was struck, though Business Insider previously reported the language in Paul Weiss&#39; copy of the agreement did not include references to DEI that were in Trump&#39;s announcement. Rachel Cohen , a now-former associate from the high-profile firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP, last Friday publicly resigned over what she said was her firm&#39;s resistance to challenging the president&#39;s orders. Also on Friday, the president sent a&nbsp; memo to Attorney General Pam Bondi &nbsp;ordering her to identify &#34;frivolous&#34; lawsuits against his administration and flag the law firms associated with the cases so they can be targeted for punitive actions like those levied against Paul Weiss and Perkins Coie. In an email to his staff on Sunday, Paul Weiss Chairman Brad Karp called Trump&#39;s order &#34;unprecedented&#34; in the firm&#39;s 150-year history and an &#34;existential threat.&#34; &#34;The executive order could easily have destroyed our firm,&#34; Karp wrote. &#34;It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients.&#34; The assault on Big Law &mdash;&nbsp;and each firm&#39;s disparate handling of the orders against them &mdash;&nbsp;has made waves across the legal industry, with legal scholars warning Business Insider the unprecedented attacks from the sitting president are a threat to the rule of law that have implications far beyond damaging the businesses of the targeted firms. &#34;Something like this has never happened, or maybe hasn&#39;t happened since the time of Andrew Jackson. I mean, this is really a kind of a constitutional crisis,&#34; Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, previously told BI. &#34;I think our legal system is under attack, and it&#39;s a question of who&#39;s going to step up and defend it.&#34; Have a tip?

    "title": "See the competing F-47 stealth fighter jet concepts from Boeing, Lockheed, and more that led to the Air Force's NGAD",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/f47-ngad-6th-generation-stealth-fighter-jet-concept-2025-3",
    "description": "An artist rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter, the F-47. US Air Force Boeing won the $20 billion contract to develop the Air Force&#39;s sixth-gen stealth fighter, the F-47 . The designation is a nod to the P-47 fighter, the USAF&#39;s founding year, and the 47th president. See the competing NGAD fighter designs proposed by Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. Boeing will develop the US Air Force&#39;s highly anticipated sixth-generation stealth fighter, poised to replace the F-22 Raptor and play a leading role in the Air Force&#39;s future fleet. The sixth-generation combat aircraft is a central component of the Air Force&#39;s secretive and costly Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) , which seeks to fly the future fighter, designated the F-47, alongside autonomous drone wingmen known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). Though never officially confirmed, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman competed for the $20 billion contract. Northrop Grumman dropped out of the running in 2023, leaving Boeing to battle it out with Lockheed Martin&#39;s dominance of the stealth fighter force. Boeing&#39;s successful bid An artist rendering shows an early version of Boeing&#39;s proposed design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation stealth fighter. Boeing President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing was selected to develop the future combat aircraft, which will be designated the F-47. The designation is a deviation from typical naming conventions because it was previously used for the World War II-era fighter, the P-47. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said the designation is a nod to the P-47 escort fighter of World War II, as well as the Air Force&#39;s founding year in 1947 and the &#34;pivotal&#34; support of the 47th US President Donald Trump in developing the aircraft. Winning the $20 billion NGAD contract will serve as a much-needed boost not only to its waning defense unit but also to recoup losses from the KC-46 tanker and new Air Force One aircraft . Steve Parker, interim president, and chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said the company made &#34;the most significant investment in the history of our defense business&#34; after being tasked with designing, building, and delivering the sixth-generation fighter to the Air Force. &#34;We are ready to provide the most advanced and innovative NGAD aircraft needed to support the mission,&#34; Parker said in a statement. The US Air Force&#39;s next-gen stealth plane An early concept art rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter. US Air Force The pursuit for America&#39;s next-generation platforms began over a decade ago in the early 2010s. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched a study in 2014 to explore strategies to maintain the US&#39; edge in air superiority. It found that simply developing sixth-generation combat aircraft wouldn&#39;t be enough to ensure air superiority against US adversaries, instead urging a &#34;family of systems&#34; across multiple domains, including air, space, and cyberspace. Air superiority is the condition where a nation&#39;s aircraft can fly at minimal risk from other aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. The US&#39;s longtime edge in achieving this is increasingly threatened by the proliferation of air defense missiles and China&#39;s aircraft build-up , including two types of stealth fighters. Building upon DARPA&#39;s findings, the Air Force launched its own study, Air Superiority 2030, which laid the groundwork for its NGAD program, which envisioned creating a future hybrid fleet of crewed and uncrewed aerial systems. As one of the Air Force&#39;s most sensitive and highly classified programs, few details were publicly known about the NGAD program. In September 2020, Will Roper, then-Air Force acquisition chief, officially confirmed that the service had test-flown a prototype of its next-gen fighter . This was the first public acknowledgment of the top-secret program that he said he hoped would garner &#34;greater credibility&#34; on the program&#39;s progress. By 2023, Boeing, Lockheed Martin , and Northrop Grumman appeared to be in the running to develop the NGAD platform, floating potential designs for it in promotional materials for their future projects &mdash; a common practice among US military aircraft manufacturers. Northrop Grumman &mdash; the lead contractor for the B-2 Spirit and B-21 Raider stealth bombers &mdash; was also in the running to build the NGAD aircraft but dropped out of consideration as the prime developer in 2023, instead intending to support other bids as a supplier. Early concept designs A video promoting Boeing Phantom Works&#39; upcoming projects appears to show a concept rendering of the next-generation platform. Boeing Defense/X Art renderings of the NGAD fighter show little more than the jet&#39;s sleek exterior and wings, revealing few details about the aircraft&#39;s final design. But concept designs released by the three competing legacy combat aircraft contractors could give an idea of what the F-47 could look like when it takes to the skies. In a promotional video released by Boeing Phantom Works in 2023, a brief rendering of a 3D model stealth plane showed assembling mid-flight to showcase the digital design capabilities to streamline the development of innovative aircraft. The hypothetical stealth aircraft appears to feature a flat, tailless cranked wing design with two engines. A fighter jet upset An art rendering shows Lockheed Martin&#39;s proposed design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation stealth fighter. Lockheed Martin Before Boeing was selected to build the F-47, Lockheed Martin had a monopoly on the Air Force&#39;s combat aircraft production , leading some to believe that it would be the prime contractor of the NGAD platform. Following the fighter jet upset, Boeing&#39;s share price jumped 3% to $5.28 a share on Friday, adding $4 billion in market value. Meanwhile, Lockheed&#39;s stock dropped about 5.4% to $27.04 a share, an estimated $6 billion loss in market value. &#34;While disappointed with this outcome, we are confident we delivered a competitive solution,&#34; Lockheed Martin said in a statement. Boeing has long been a major player in the military aerospace sector, including developing the F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets and the KC-46 aerial tanker . However, unlike competitors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which secured domestic contracts for the F-22 Raptor and B-2 Spirit stealth aircraft respectively, Boeing&#39;s long-term defense production largely relies on foreign acquisition and international defense sales. Boeing and Lockheed previously faced off to develop the fifth-generation multirole fighter as part of the Pentagon&#39;s Joint Strike Fighter program. Lockheed&#39;s X-35 beat out Boeing&#39;s X-32, entering production as the F-35 Lightning II . Lockheed&#39;s NGAD design Lockheed Martin posted an aircraft outline that appeared to resemble an NGAD-like platform on its Instagram story. Lockheed Martin/Instagram Lockheed&#39;s hint at its potential NGAD concept proposal was a lot more subtle. In 2023, Lockheed&#39;s Skunk Works division posted a black-and-white aircraft outline on its Instagram to celebrate its 80th anniversary. Despite the lack of details in the cryptic post, the planform appears to resemble a tactical aircraft design, likely related to the Air Force&#39;s NGAD program. Lockheed further pointed to its potential future participation in the NGAD by releasing another promotional video later that year, seemingly referring to the Air Force&#39;s pursuit of a hybrid fleet. The video features crewed and uncrewed systems flying in formation, with Lockheed&#39;s F-35 surrounded by futuristic UAVs. Northrop Grumman withdraws NGAD bid A 2021 video released by Northrop Grumman featured concept renderings of its future aircraft projects, including what appears to be a next-generation fighter jet. Northrop Grumman/YouTube Northrop Grumman was also competing to be the prime contractor behind the Air Force&#39;s NGAD aircraft. The company hinted at its interest in participating in the NGAD program in a 2021 promotional video that appeared to include a tailless stealth fighter in a hangar with historic and futuristic aircraft. But Northrop Grumman&#39;s bid to build the NGAD fighter was cut short after it pulled out of consideration in 2023, CEO Kathy Warden announced. Warden added that the company was &#34;responding to other bidders&#39; request for proposal as the supplier, that&#39;s particularly in our mission system portfolio.&#34; Navy&#39;s next-gen fighter up for grabs An artist rendering shows an early version of Northrop Grumman&#39;s design for the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter. Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman was selected to build the B-21 Raider, the Air Force&#39;s first sixth-generation stealth bomber, as part of the service&#39;s Long Range Strike Bomber program. The company unveiled the stealth bomber in late 2022, and the aircraft took its maiden flight in November 2023. Northrop Grumman is still in the running against Boeing to develop the Navy&#39;s next-generation fighter, the F/A-XX, which aims to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Steep ambitions, steep price tag An artist rendering of the US Air Force&#39;s sixth-generation fighter, the F-47. US Air Force The NGAD&#39;s steep ambitions to revolutionize the US&nbsp; air superiority mission &nbsp;come with an equally steep price tag. In 2018, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the NGAD airframe alone could cost up to $300 million each. Then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in 2023 that he anticipated the unit cost to be &#34;too expensive to be purchased in large numbers,&#34; revealing the service&#39;s plan to team each NGAD with two CCAs. From 2022 to 2024, Congress allocated $5.1 billion to develop NGAD-related technologies, which included a &#34;strategic pause&#34; in the program due to high project costs. In 2025, the Biden administration requested $2.75 billion to build an NGAD platform, which could skyrocket to an estimated $5.72 billion by 2029. &#39;China is a threat today&#39; An F-22 flies over Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. US Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Paige Weldon Kendall emphasized the pressing need for the NGAD &#34; family of systems &#34; amid evolving threats by US adversaries, especially after the Pentagon truncated the procurement of F-22 jets from 750 to 187 in 2009. &#34;NGAD will include attributes such as enhanced lethality and the ability to survive, persist, interoperate, and adapt in the air domain, all within highly contested operational environments,&#34; Kendall said in May 2023. &#34;No one does this better than the US Air Force , but we will lose that edge if we don&#39;t move forward now.&#34; The urgency is also spurred in part by China&#39;s increasingly sophisticated long-range air defense and electronic warfare systems as China-Taiwan tensions contribute to growing militarization in the Indo-Pacific. The F-47 is expected to operate closely with two new uncrewed fighters , so-called &#34;loyal wingmen&#34; that are capable of flying missions too dangerous for a pilot in the cockpit. In a potential war scenario with China , defense analysts argued the F-22&#39;s limited range and payload capacity would be ill-suited for the terrain, consisting of islands spread hundreds of miles apart, leaving the fleet vulnerable to attack during refueling efforts. &#34;China is not a future threat; China is a threat today,&#34; Kendall said during a 2024 keynote address. &#34;I am not saying war in the Pacific is imminent or inevitable. It is not,&#34; he added. &#34;But I am saying that the likelihood is increasing and will continue to do so.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/veterans-roast-trump-officials-with-signal-memes-2025-3",
    "description": "US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was one of the top officials who used the Signal app to discuss airstrikes in an apparent breach of security protocol. ALEX WROBLEWSKI/AFP via Getty Images Military social media is buzzing with memes about officials&#39; use (or misuse) of Signal . Trump officials mistakenly added a journalist to a Signal chat on military operations. The Pentagon recently warned against using Signal due to hacking concerns. Is the cure to male loneliness… starting a group text to bomb the Houthis ? That&#39;s one of the sarcastic questions posed in memes blowing up across military-focused social media after top Trump officials used Signal to discuss airstrikes against Yemen&#39;s Houthi militants &mdash; an operational security violation, or OPSEC, almost certain to be career-ending or worse for a rank-and-file soldier. Vice President JD Vance , Trump&#39;s national security advisor Mike Waltz, and other top officials debated whether to strike Yemen in a group chat that mistakenly included Jeffery Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, who reported on the chaotic exchange. Goldberg reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared an attack plan, including the names of those being targeted, before the airstrikes on the encrypted app &mdash; raising concerns this practice could spoil the operation or endanger troops. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kyle Eberly (@sitreps2steercos) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that &#34;there was no classified information as I understand it,&#34; and Waltz added, &#34;We have our legal teams looking at it.&#34; Signal has been widely used for years throughout lower military levels for communication. But even junior troops with access to top-secret materials, which could include pending missile strikes, have long known that communicating such sensitive details should only be done via government-provided secure lines, like SIPR (secure internet protocol router) email or phone, making the message exchange an intelligence gaffe of preposterous proportions. The founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, mocked the spillage . &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations,&#34; he wrote in a post on X Monday. Likely because of Signal&#39;s popularity, the Pentagon released new guidance last week discouraging the app&#39;s use even for everyday communications, NPR reported Tuesday . According to the memo NPR cites, &#34;Russian professional hacking groups are employing the &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations,&#34; the guidance read. &#34;The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information.&#34; The memo was dated March 18, one week after the baffling Houthi chat began. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kyle Eberly (@sitreps2steercos) Memes circulating online poke fun at Hegseth, Vance, Waltz, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard , all military veterans who presumably had to undergo annual cyber awareness while serving. Many memes and users pondered whether the entire military would be required to brush up on OPSEC (operational security) classes and ask if the adage &#34;different spanks for different ranks,&#34; will continue to hold true. Former CIA operations officer John Sipher called the move &#34;worse tha[n] amateur&#34; in a post on BlueSky. &#34;It 100% provides Moscow information on US capabilities and personalities. Information they can use down the line or share with Iran &mdash; the Houthi enablers. It may provide ongoing access to some participants.&#34; Okay this one is my favorite Signal gate meme [image or embed] &mdash; ex-Lethality Jane ( @lethalityjane.bsky.social ) March 25, 2025 at 2:04 PM &#34;Member when all we had to worry about was some S2 dork bringing his cellphone into the scif?&#34; asked one commenter, referring to personnel in ultra-secure areas known as sensitive compartmented information facilities. &#34;Pepperidge farms remembers.&#34; &#34;Text STOP to unsubscribe from war plan updates,&#34; read another. &#34;Somewhere a US Army counterintelligence agent is having a minor breakdown over how he has a perfect new case study for his annual OPSEC brief but he won&#39;t be able to use it for at least four years,&#34; read yet another BlueSky post.

    "title": "Chinese brands are racking up record safety warnings in the US",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-ecommerce-brands-record-safety-warnings-us-consumer-watchdog-2025-3",
    "description": "Two-thirds of the products that received consumer safety warnings in 2024 came to the US from Chinese companies, according to the Public Interest Research Group. Associated Press US consumer safety watchdogs are issuing a rapidly growing number of product warnings. Warnings are issued when companies don&#39;t voluntarily comply with recalls for products deemed hazardous. A US official told the Public Interest Research Group the surge boils down to one word: China. The explosion of international e-commerce brands is leading to a sharp rise in product safety warnings. Warnings issued by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission reached a record high of 63 last year, according to a new analysis from the Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission issues warnings when companies don&#39;t voluntarily comply with recalls for hazardous it deems hazardous. Last year&#39;s figure is up dramatically from 38 in 2023 and 12 in 2022, according to the PIRG analysis. There were fewer than 10 warnings combined from 2015 to 2021, it added. So, what&#39;s contributing to the rise? &#34;In a word, China,&#34; acting CPSC&#39;s chairman, Peter Feldman, told PIRG. Two-thirds of the products that received warnings in 2024 came to the US from Chinese companies, the PIRG report found. &#34;The United States is facing a flood of Chinese consumer products that violate US safety laws,&#34; Feldman said. &#34;When CPSC identifies illegal Chinese goods, the manufacturer is, more often than not, unreachable, unfindable, or uncooperative.&#34; In other words, a warning is an indication that safety officials are not able to make progress with a company concerning a recall. Some of the hazardous products included a foldable step stool that could collapse or tip over, a line of e-bike batteries prone to overheating or catching fire, infant loungers that posed a risk of suffocation or entrapment, and bike helmets that didn&#39;t meet US safety standards. Many of the products that received warnings were sold by third parties on Amazon&#39;s and Walmart&#39;s marketplaces. In at least one instance each, both retailers agreed to contact customers about affected products. An Amazon spokesperson told BI that all products offered on its site are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The company also notifies customers of product updates through a dedicated page in page in their Amazon accounts called &#34;Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts.&#34; The PIRG analysis also found two items with warnings that were sold on Shein&#39;s website. Among the recalled products, the report found that those sold exclusively online were twice as likely to violate a US safety standard than those sold in physical stores. Interestingly, while eight products were recalled that were exclusively sold on Temu, the PIRG report also noted that no Temu items received warnings last year because all companies involved cooperated with the recall procedure.

    "description": "Ben Affleck at the world premiere of &#34;The Accountant 2&#34; at SXSW. Marcus Ingram / Getty Images Ben Affleck told GQ that he made his Hollywood career a 9-to-5 job to spend more time with his children. &#34;I was really missing time I could never get back,&#34; he said. Affleck shares three children with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner. Ben Affleck said he adapted his filmmaking career into a 9-to-5 job so that he could spend more time with his three teenage children. In a new GQ interview , Affleck said he realized that being present as a parent was important to him, so he wanted to avoid spending multiple days on sets away from his children. &#34;I was really missing time I could never get back. My kids were 8, 11, and 14, and I felt like: I don&#39;t want to miss any of this time at all,&#34; Affleck said. &#34;And so I thought, well, Let me figure out a way to work at home and have the kind of job where I can actually be here and build my schedule around that.&#34; Affleck co-parents three children with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner : Violet Anne Affleck, 19, Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck, 16, and Samuel Affleck, 13. Affleck told GQ he developed a better work-life balance while working at Artists Equity, a production company he co-founded with his longtime friend and collaborator Matt Damon and investing partner Gerry Cardinale. Since the company&#39;s founding in 2022, they have produced the critically acclaimed sports movie &#34; Air &#34; and the upcoming action sequel, &#34;The Accountant 2,&#34; among others. &#34;Part of what&#39;s great about this Artists Equity job, part of why I love it, is because I&#39;m in LA,&#34; Affleck said. &#34;When we&#39;re done at 2:30, I&#39;m going to go, and I&#39;ll be home at 3:45 when my kids get off the bus. And I&#39;m able to construct a life that does that. And that means more to me than any of it. That makes me happier.&#34; Matt Damon and Ben Affleck at SXSW festival to promote Artists Equity&#39;s latest film, &#34;The Accountant 2.&#34; Michael Buckner/SXSW Conference &amp; Festivals via Getty Images Affleck also told GQ that he now avoids directing more films because they can be time-consuming. &#34;The one regret I have about all the movies that I&#39;ve directed is the amount of time it&#39;s taken me away from my kids,&#34; he said. &#34;I love making art. I loved making &#39;The Town . &#39; But I was away from my kids for long periods of time. There&#39;s little chunks that I missed, and that doesn&#39;t feel good.&#34; Other celebrities, such as Kieran Culkin and Eva Mendes , have also opened up about how they balance their careers with raising children. Mendes told the &#34; Today &#34; show in 2024 that she took a hiatus from acting to pursue other projects, like writing a children&#39;s book and raising her two children with Ryan Gosling . &#34;I still work. I just didn&#39;t act because acting takes you on locations. It takes you away,&#34; Mendes said. Meanwhile, Culkin, who won his first Oscar earlier this month, told the Guardian in 2024 that he has a rule to not spend more than 8 days on set away from his children.

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-doge-voter-rolls-executive-order-2025-3",
    "description": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly made false claims about elections. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images President Donald Trump wants DOGE to look at voter rolls. According to an executive order, the DOGE office would help review public voter information. No federal official has the power to remove a person from state rolls. President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered the DOGE office to assist in reviewing publicly available voter rolls. In a lengthy executive order, Trump asked the Department of Homeland Security to work with DOGE administrator Amy Gleason &#34;to review each State&#39;s publicly available voter registration list and available records concerning voter list maintenance activities.&#34; It&#39;s unclear the extent to which DOGE would use the data. No federal official has the power to remove someone from the voter rolls. &#34;DOGE certainly has no power to kick people off rolls,&#34; Rick Hasen, an election law expert and a law professor at UCLA, told Business Insider. &#34;But they could make a lot of noise trying to claim they&#39;ve found fraud when they find that voter registration rolls are not being kept up to date.&#34; The White House has repeatedly said Gleason leads the DOGE office. She recently declared in court that Elon Musk does not work for the rebranded US DOGE Service. But Musk is the de facto leader of DOGE, a point underscored by his appearance on Fox News Tuesday night with members of the DOGE team. Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the DOGE office&#39;s efforts to obtain sensitive and nonpublic federal data. Unlike social security data, many states make their voter lists publicly available, often for a fee. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group that monitors state-level legislation, some states restrict access to their information. Trump has repeatedly falsely claimed that he won the 2020 election. After his 2016 victory, he repeatedly claimed without evidence that fraud prevented him from winning the popular vote. In the lead-up to the 2024 race, Republicans raised concerns about non-citizens voting in the presidential race, an occurrence that remains rare and illegal. Recent audits of voter rolls have found extremely few numbers of noncitizens registered to vote. Georgia found 20 noncitizens registered to vote out of more than 8 million registered voters in the state. During the first Trump administration, 44 states opposed a Trump election commission&#39;s sweeping request for voter information, according to a 2017 CNN report. At the time, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, vice chair of the commission, had said the data would eventually be made public. Hasen told Business Insider said Tuesday&#39;s EO could spark such a confrontation again. &#34;We will see what happens this time,&#34; he said. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "What is Signal? How the popular encrypted messaging app keeps your texts private",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-signal-app",
    "description": "Signal is an encrypted messaging app. Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Signal is a messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption to keep your messages private. When you send a message on Signal, the only people who can see it are the recipients. You can use the Signal app to send texts, photos, videos, and voice messages. Over the last few years, Signal has become one of the most popular messaging apps. Favored by tech giants, cybersecurity experts, journalists, government officials, and many more, Signal has gone from a darling secret of the security community to a group chatting phenomenon. It&#39;s recently been thrust into the spotlight after the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat where top Trump administration officials discussed bombing Yemen. According to Goldberg, Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard , and Secretary of State Marco Rubio all appeared to be members of the group chat, which was called &#34;Houthi PC small group,&#34; referring to the principals committee. Signal founder and former CEO Matthew Rosenfeld, who goes by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike, poked fun at the botched chat in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. &#34;There are so many great reasons to be on Signal,&#34; he wrote. &#34;Now including the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations.&#34; Elon Musk has also endorsed Signal before, writing simply in a post on X in 2021, &#34;Use Signal.&#34; He changed his mind about the app a few years later, though, writing in May 2024 that it had &#34;known vulnerabilities.&#34; Signal&#39;s president, Meredith Whittaker , later told Wired she went two nights without sleeping &#34;just dealing with Twitter stuff.&#34; &#34;He&#39;s been a fan. So I don&#39;t know what changed,&#34; she said. &#34;What I do know is that, as far as we know, the claim was completely baseless.&#34; Whittaker added there was no &#34;serious report&#34; backing up Musk&#39;s claims. Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up in 2018 by the app&#39;s cofounders, Rosenfeld and Brian Acton, who also cofounded WhatsApp . The foundation has five board members and serves to &#34;support Signal&#39;s growth and ongoing operations as well as investigate the future of private communication,&#34; according to its website . Here&#39;s a guide to the Signal app, including why it&#39;s become so popular. The Signal app, explained Signal is safer and more secure than most messengers because of a process called &#34; end-to-end encryption .&#34; This works by encoding a sender&#39;s message in such a way that only the intended receiver can view it. Neither Signal, nor your phone company, nor the government can read your messages. That&#39;s why it has remained popular. Signal lets you chat securely. Signal However, Signal&#39;s messages are only secure if both the sender and receiver are using the app. If you prefer to communicate through Signal, the app has a simple feature to invite someone to download it. It&#39;s also just as easy to block someone on Signal from contacting you. Encryption itself isn&#39;t a unique feature, as apps like iMessage, Telegram, and WeChat also offer it. But one of Signal&#39;s selling points is that its source code is also publicly available, so experts have been able to poke and prod at its defenses for years, strengthening it in the process. Signal&#39;s key features Signal is similar to other messaging apps but with more robust security features. It&#39;s available for free on iPhone, Android, Mac, and PC. Android users can even set their default messaging app to Signal if they want to. There&#39;s a Signal app on nearly every major system. Signal.org On a basic level, you can have one-on-one conversations with someone or start a group chat on Signal . In these chats, you can send pictures, videos, internet links, voice messages, and more. Signal&#39;s beta version has tested new kinds of chats with forum-like features, including group admins, updates, and timers for disappearing messages. For now, groups are capped at 1,000 people, but adding and removing people from a Signal group is simple. If you&#39;re concerned about someone accessing the app from your phone, you can lock the Signal app with the same passcode or fingerprint scan normally used to lock your phone. Signal requires a phone number to join the app. To keep yours private, you can sign up with a Google Voice number. Apple users will want to visit their privacy settings within the app and turn off &#34;Show Calls in Recents&#34; to prevent their history from syncing with the cloud. You can also set your messages to disappear over time, or set photos to disappear after a single viewing. Barbara Smith and Vivian McCall contributed to an earlier version of this story.

    "title": "Joining the MCU was the best business decision Elizabeth Olsen ever made ",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-olsen-movies-tv-shows-marvel-2025-3",
    "description": "Jake Giles Netter/Max; Magnolia Pictures; Marvel Studios; Chelsea Jia Feng/BI Elizabeth Olsen may be best known for starring in a billion-dollar franchise, but she still holds her indie roots close. Three years after her breakthrough in the 2011 indie film &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene,&#34; a Sundance darling that cost less than $1 million to make, Olsen would make her first in a decade&#39;s worth of appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch . She said taking the role was a smart &mdash; not to mention lucrative &mdash; decision. But while Olsen told Business Insider the storytelling possibilities are &#34;endless&#34; in the MCU, it&#39;s important she diversifies her work outside blockbusters. &#34;Those other choices you make are incredibly important because they say so much about what your passion is,&#34; Olsen said. That led her to her latest role in Fleur Fortuné&#39;s new dystopian sci-fi thriller , &#34;The Assessment.&#34; Olsen and Himesh Patel star as Mia and Aaryan, a couple who agree to undergo an emotionally grueling seven-day assessment to determine if they&#39;re fit to have children. Himesh Patel and Elizabeth Olsen in &#34;The Assessment.&#34; Magnolia Pictures Olsen was intrigued by the dystopian premise of &#34;The Assessment&#34; and the opportunity to work with Fortuné, whom she described as an incredible visual filmmaker. &#34;I loved the game and the rules of the game that these characters had to play together,&#34; Olsen said. &#34;I loved how contained something that took place in a near future time was. And I really love stories that play by their own rules.&#34; As an independent film, &#34;The Assessment&#34; offered a more intimate atmosphere, one that allowed Fortuné, Olsen, Patel, and their costar Alicia Vikander to become t heir own indie version of the Avengers: &#34;I really felt like we were our own little troupe.&#34; For the latest interview in Business Insider&#39;s Role Play series, Olsen reflects on auditioning for police procedurals, the best advice she ever got, and how starring in Marvel projects has bolstered her indie career. On auditioning for anything and everything early in her career Olsen in &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene.&#34; Fox Searchlight Business Insider: You have an affinity for playing characters who are going through a lot emotionally, going as far back as your film debut in &#34;Martha Marcy May Marlene.&#34; What draws you to these heavier roles? Elizabeth Olsen: With &#34;Martha,&#34; I mean, I auditioned for everything around that time. I auditioned for &#34;Blue Bloods,&#34; I auditioned for &#34;CSI&#34; whatever it was, I auditioned for &#34;Law &amp; Order.&#34; I auditioned for all of the things and it just happened to be a job that I got. I would have said yes to any job because I just wanted to be a working actor. I just happened to be very lucky that it was a script that I was totally obsessed with and a character that I was really fighting for. I don&#39;t mean to put myself through any kind of extreme experience, but I do think the extremities of what it means to be a person in the world are more interesting to explore. The things that I&#39;m really drawn to right now are: What are prototypes or characters that we&#39;ve seen before, and then how can we subvert them in some way? At least on the job I&#39;m on right now, that&#39;s how I feel. You got to work with Spike Lee on the 2013 &#34;Oldboy&#34; remake. What was it like working with a famed director so early in your career? You could have told me to do anything with him, and I would have done it. I loved getting to work with him. He is also such a kind filmmaker. He&#39;s so kind to his crew. He&#39;s kind to his cast. He has such a boyishness to him and to get to work with him was really such a dream. He has such a canon that it&#39;s amazing that I keep watching movies of his that I hadn&#39;t seen before. I just watched &#34;School Daze&#34; recently, twice, and I am such a fan of his work, and continue to be. I feel lucky that I got to work with him. On being &#39;petrified&#39; on the set of &#39;Avengers: Age of Ultron&#39; and why Marvel characters are like Greek heroes Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch in &#34;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.&#34; Marvel Studios It&#39;s also been 10 years since you played Wanda in &#34; Avengers: Age of Ultron .&#34; With all that time and hindsight, is there anything that you look back on and view differently about that movie or your experience working on it? Oh, I was petrified. I was so scared. I didn&#39;t know how to take up space at all. And I felt good, actually, about that film. I think we established a foundation for her that we kept building off of. It&#39;s really nice to have had 10 years with the character. I have to say, it&#39;s something you don&#39;t always get to have unless you&#39;re doing television. So, if someone asked me to do it again in 50 years, I hope I&#39;m still around to play a very old version of her [ Laughs ]. Hey, if Hugh Jackman can do it, so can you. Yeah! After the events of &#34; Doctor Strange 2 ,&#34; there&#39;s a big question mark surrounding your character. Do you feel like there&#39;s unfinished business, or more to explore after Wanda&#39;s villain arc in that movie? I don&#39;t know if I feel like there&#39;s unfinished business, but I always feel like there&#39;s room to explore. I think the comic books have been going on for so many decades that there is such endless story that you can always go back to. How we make it work for the world that we&#39;ve established, I&#39;m not sure. But I do think you can always keep going back with these characters. They&#39;re like iconic Greek heroes, basically. And there&#39;s always stories to be had with those types of prototypes. On finding success outside the MCU and the role that marked a turning point Olsen playing infamous killer Candy Montgomery in &#34;Love &amp; Death.&#34; Jake Giles Netter/Max The MCU is vast, but all those projects can be time consuming. How have you navigated the balance of playing this character that you care about for so long and also getting to explore other material outside of that, like indie movies and TV series like &#34;Sorry for Your Loss,&#34; &#34;Ingrid Goes West,&#34; and &#34;Wind River&#34;? Well, it&#39;s just scheduling, I guess, at the end of the day. Sometimes things don&#39;t always work out, but I think those types of choices become really important, because if you&#39;re only doing Marvel projects, the way other producers or directors see you, they might make assumptions that you don&#39;t want to work on something super small, or you don&#39;t want to work on TV, and so your choices have to reflect what your interests are. I think sometimes that was hard for me because of what I was being offered, and sometimes I&#39;ve taken advantage of it in a way that I&#39;m proud of, but it&#39;s been a real balance to learn from. Was it a confidence boost for you to see the positive reactions to those things outside blockbusters? How did those movies and shows affect how you have viewed your career trajectory? I think you do a job because you want to feel fulfilled by the skill that you&#39;re trying to improve upon. &#34;Sorry for Your Loss&#34; for two years was one of the best [examples]. There&#39;s so many hours that were put into that, from pitching it with just a pilot to finishing the sound and the color correction on it. It was something that for two years of my life, I got to learn so much from, and I think that was a big moment that I started to find a different kind of fulfillment out of this job and a different kind of commitment. And I think it&#39;s just because of the hours you spend, just like anything else. So when people write anything positive about your work, of course your ego is grateful because then you think eyes will see it, and then you get a bit more of a boost of the next projects coming in, which is the goal. On her Marvel star power opening doors to more opportunities and feeling empowered to say no Paul Bettany as Vision and Olsen as Wanda in &#34;WandaVision.&#34; Marvel Studios Speaking more broadly, what&#39;s the best business decision that you ever made for your career? Probably doing Marvel, because if you&#39;re thinking about business, you&#39;re thinking about how you&#39;re able to take care of, I guess, a short-term future and a long-term future. Marvel has allowed me to bring eyes and potentially money to projects that are very small and maybe wouldn&#39;t have been seen in other iterations. So I think that&#39;s been very helpful from a business perspective. There&#39;s a piece of advice that you&#39;ve mentioned that has really guided you: &#34;No&#34; is a full sentence. Can you share a time in your career when you felt empowered to put that advice into practice? Well, the ones that first come up, I wouldn&#39;t want to share those because it is very empowering to say no, and I&#39;m also very private with the things I say no to. But it&#39;s an important thing to know that regardless of your own status or power dynamic, you always have that power. I think the biggest one that I can think of &mdash; without saying anything about it &mdash; I look back in hindsight, and I think, &#34;How did I have the confidence to say that?&#34; Because I wasn&#39;t in a position of power. It was very early in my career and I felt so confident to just speak what my boundaries were. So yeah, I think that&#39;s always good advice. It was probably being green that empowered you to just say that, right? Yeah, like, &#34;Whatever! This is what it is. You can either take it or leave it.&#34; I think I became even better at it later. But yeah, I think it is an important thing for everyone.

They found that many young stars host modest disks of gas and dust, some as small as 1.2 astronomical units. The research, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, establishes an important link between observed protoplanetary disks and exoplanets.",

In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL’s Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether. At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player. She failed countless times before she began to soar. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Many believed Steph Curry’s Golden State were past it in 2022 before they won the championship. This time around, Jimmy Butler has given them new life It felt like the end, again. The Golden State Warriors missed the playoffs in 2020 and 2021, but they stormed back from the abyss in 2022 to beat the Boston Celtics in the NBA finals. Steph Curry was 33 for most of that season. Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were 31. The Warriors’ return to the pinnacle of basketball had the whiff of a last hurrah, and indeed, their championship core faded for a second time after that: a second-round exit in 2023, a play-in tournament flatlining in 2024. Curry and his four-time championship-winning teammates continued to get older in the way athletes do. Continue reading...",

When his sons, Jakob, Filip and Henrik, stormed to Olympic, world and European titles, the reality television cameras were there to capture many of the steps, squabbles and medals along the way. Little wonder that Team Ingebrigtsen became the most popular TV show in Norwegian history.

Iran join Japan and New Zealand as the first countries to have punched their ticket via the usual qualification process, while co-hosts United States, Mexico and Canada qualified automatically. Internazionale striker Mehdi Taremi was largely to thank for Team Melli’s accomplishment on Tuesday, scoring both goals in an otherwise sloppy performance from Iran.

The top-seeded Trojans kept going without their star player, pummeling Mississippi State 96-59 to reach the Sweet 16 for the second straight year, but the injury cast a shadow over the entire evening as one of college basketball’s biggest stars was left in serious distress. Watkins was streaking to the basket chased by two defenders when her knee bent awkwardly as she planted her right leg, the non-contact injury causing her to crumple to the floor. The crowd went silent as she writhed in pain and clutched her knee while her teammates looked on helplessly and USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb rushed to her side. ESPN reported that the 19-year-old has torn her ACL and will undergo surgery. Watkins was averaging 24.6 points this season for USC. Continue reading...",

They played too, becoming league champions, but never imagined themselves over there. “Our reality was Astroturf pitches with no stands,” she recalls.

Bosnia and Herzegovina might have something to say, but I’m looking for a combined score from two teams who have actually played each other.” Uzbekistan (25 Scrabble points) beat Kyrgyzstan (30) 1-0 to close in on a first-ever World Cup qualification – and Ben’s question inspired a flurry of tile-totting emails. Before we dive in, some ground rules. To try and keep things relatively simple, we’ll stick with the country names in English that are used by Fifa . So no long official names e.g. ‘Kingdom of …’ – and we’re using the English language Scrabble scoring system. Iran v Laos (last played in 2004) is the lowest Scrabble score for an international fixture, notes Andrew Hastie. Pete Tomlin suggests Venezuela v Brazil (38pts) as South America’s highest-scoring fixture, and New Zealand v Papua New Guinea (45pts) for Oceania.

    "description": "GeoGuessr, the geography game that tasks players with guessing a location in the world based on a random Google Street View image, is coming to Steam . It’s slated to hit early access on the platform sometime in April. That should hopefully make the game much easier to access on Steam Deck without having to fiddle with browser settings on desktop mode. The developers are taking the early access approach on Steam so they can &quot;refine the gameplay, introduce new features and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players&quot; with the aim of making &quot;the ultimate competitive and casual geography game.&quot; The early access version on Steam will at the very least have a competitive solo mode and casual Team Duels, though there are plans to add more modes and competitive features in the coming months. GeoGuessr has a fairly thriving competitive scene — this year&#39;s world championship has a $100,000 prize pool — so you could stand to cash in if you become great at the game. But be warned: if you think pro GeoGuessr might be your calling, you&#39;ll be up against some incredibly skilled players. They can pinpoint parts of the world based on corn growing at the side of a road , clouds in the sky and room decor . GeoGuessr pros are absolutely absurd. It&#39;s not clear how much the full Steam version will cost. A free version will include unlimited access to the amateur division, which is GeoGuessr&#39;s lowest rank, as well as unranked Team Duels. A Steam Pass that&#39;s available to purchase inside the game will be required to access the full Solo Duels mode. The store page notes that the price won&#39;t change during the time the game is in early access (a period that&#39;s expected to be at least six months). Nor do the developers expect to increase the price when the game exits early access. The original, 12-year-old web version allows players to make three free daily guesses, but to play more you have to pay for a subscription, which starts at $2.50 per month. Unlimited access on the mobile apps is available on the $3 per month Pro Unlimited plan. While there will be cross-play between Steam and the browser/mobile versions, the current GeoGuessr plans don&#39;t include full access to the Steam edition.

    "description": "You can pick up the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for only $20 right now thanks to Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . Not only is that a $15 discount, but its only a couple of dollars more than the record-low price we&#39;ve tracked. Amazon released the Fire TV Stick HD last October and, soon after, it became the top budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices . It&#39;s a basic stre2amer that received a couple of much-needed updates when Amazon revamped its Fire TV devices last year. The Fire TV Stick HD has HDR support and streams with full HD resolution. It also comes with an Alexa-powered remote control, which lets you search for titles with just a click of the Alexa button. That remote also has Netflix and Prime Video buttons, but the device can run most streaming apps, like Disney+ and Peacock.&nbsp; Elsewhere in the Fire TV lineup, you can grab the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for only $40 thanks to Amazon Spring Sale deals. This is the most powerful streaming dongle Amazon makes, with support for 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos, Wi-Fi 6E and Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass gaming.

    "description": "It turns out Nintendo Directs are like buses. You wait ages for one then get two in quick succession. Days before Nintendo fully spills the beans on the Switch 2 during a dedicated showcase on April 2 , the company is hosting a surprise Direct on March 27 at 10AM ET. You can watch it above. The stream will run for around 30 minutes and focus on upcoming Switch games. There won&#39;t be any Switch 2 info, but pretty much every game you see here will run on the new console anyway, thanks to backwards compatibility . Since this isn&#39;t billed as an Indie World Direct (those focus on indie games), it&#39;s not really clear what we can expect from this one. Nintendo&#39;s developers will largely be focused on making Switch 2 games at this point. Still, the Switch has a massive install base — the company has sold more than 150 million of those consoles — so Nintendo probably won&#39;t want to leave all those players behind any time soon.&nbsp; To that end, we can expect a stream of games for the original Switch to keep coming for the foreseeable future. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond , for instance, is still slated to hit the Switch sometime this year . Third-party games will still be coming to the Switch as well, including a certain one from Team Cherry that we expect to show up in every single gaming showcase but won&#39;t mention here because we don&#39;t want to jinx it.

We’ve reviewed Instant Pots , air fryers , coffee gear , sous vide machines and more. Lots of the gadgets and appliances we recommend are now on sale for Amazon’s latest shopping event. Read on for the best deals on kitchen tech we could find. The best Amazon Spring Sale deals on air fryers, Instant Pots and more Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $140 ($40 off) : The powerful Juice Fountain impressed us with its extraction abilities. Plus it’s relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This price isn’t as low as the $110 Amazon sold it for back in January, but this is the lowest price we’ve tracked since then. Cosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off) : Cosori’s fryer earned a spot as the runner up for best overall air fryer in our guide. It has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity. We like that it doesn’t take up too much space, but can still cook up a decent amount of food Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off) : If you want a more traditional toaster oven design with a huge capacity, go for our premium air fryer pick. The fryer-and-oven combo can accommodate a five-quart dutch oven, so it’s almost an auxiliary oven, which could come in handy when you’re cooking for a crowd. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it went for $300 at the end of last year. Breville the Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off) : This is the non-Pro version of the Breville air fryer we recommend . It has a slightly smaller capacity (0.8 cubic feet instead of one cubic foot) and is missing two cooking functions (dehydrate and proof). But if you’re not making your own jerky or baking a ton of bread, this one can toast, broil, air fry and slow cook. You can even get it in cool colors like Red Velvet Cake for the same price. Ninja DZ401 Foodi 10-quart air fryer for $190 ($40 off) : If you need to air fry two different foods at once, go for our recommendation for a dual-zone air fryer. It’s a beast, so we think it’s best for larger kitchens and people who make big meals. It went as low as $130 for Black Friday last year, but this is the cheapest price we’ve seen since then. Instant Vortex 2QT Mini Air Fryer for $50 ($10 off) : The budget pick in our guide doesn’t go on sale often — it’s already pretty cheap at its $60 list price. It’s sold for as little as $48 for Prime Day in July, but this is the cheapest we’ve seen since then. Its two-quart capacity is probably best for small kitchens and can crisp up food for one or two people. Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $90 $40 off) : We like this Instant Pot model because it&#39;s simple to use and has several quick-cooking modes including beans, cake, sous vide and more. It went as low as $70 earlier this year, but this is still a 30 percent discount off the list price. Instant Pot Pro Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $138 ($61 off) : We also suggest this fancier Pro Plus model in our guide to kitchen tech . It’s a Wi-Fi connected unit with a canning function and you can even release the steam remotely using the companion app — which has over 800 recipes. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it was $125 earlier this week and dipped as low as $99 for Black Friday last year.&nbsp; Ninja AF150AMZ Air Fryer for $120 (25 percent off) : This went as low as $100 for the holidays last year, but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen since then. The fryer gets an honorable mention in our air fryer guide because it makes good use of limited counter space with its taller design. The round cooking basket doesn’t feel as roomy as square ones but it does have a dehydrate option that other cookers don’t come with. Anova Culinary Sous Vide 3.0 for $129 ($70 off) : We named this the best overall sous vide machine after testing a number of models for our buyer’s guide. This is about $30 more than the low it hit for the holidays last year, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. We appreciate the easy digital controls and found that the high flow rate maintains water temperature better than other machines. Plus, if you’re at a loss for what to cook, you can check out the companion app which is replete with recipes. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $165 ($30 off) : This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. This is the pro model of the version we recommend in our tea guide . KitchenAid Artisan 5-quart stand mixer for $380 ($80 off) : Small wonder that the home cook’s gold standard of mixers made its way onto our kitchen tech guide . Its ton of available attachments can be used to make pasta, grind food, strain or spiralize fruits and veggies and more. This is no unitasker. This is a solid $80 discount off of the MSRP, but we’ll note that Amazon sold it for as low as $330 at the end of last year and for $350 last month. KitchenAid Go Cordless Hand Blender for $100 ($30 off) : The big selling point here is the removable battery that you can use for other KitchenAid Go appliances. In our testing, it had enough power to turn a roasted butternut squash into a smooth, creamy soup. The blender has hit this price a few times over the past few months and the deal isn’t as good as the $77 it sold for at the end of last year.

    "description": "The Amazon Spring Sale has given us a few great deals so far, but anyone looking for affordable earbuds is going to really appreciate this one. Right now, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 earbuds are down to $45 from $80 — a 44 percent discount. That&#39;s an incredible price for earbuds with active noise cancellation.&nbsp; The $45 deal on our favorite budget wireless earbuds is available for the Black and Blue models, while the White, Green and Purple options are slightly more expensive at $50. However, the latter two typically retail for $100 , so they&#39;re actually half off with the current sale.&nbsp; As mentioned above, one of the great things about Anker&#39;s Soundcore Space A40 earbuds is that they offer ANC. Anker claims that using it can reduce potential noise by 98 percent. The earbuds also hold up to 10 hours of battery and up to 50 hours with the charging case. Plus, you can get up to four hours of extra juice with just 10 minutes in the case. The sound quality is also pretty decent, especially for the price.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-deals-include-our-favorite-budget-anker-earbuds-for-45-144520277.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/napster-just-sold-for-207-million-154432315.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The once-iconic music-sharing platform Napster was just purchased for $207 million, with a company called Infinite Reality picking up the tab. What could Napster offer in 2025 to warrant such a price tag? Infinite Reality says it&#39;ll be used as a &quot;social music platform that prioritizes active fan engagement&quot; with a focus on giving artists a platform they can use to connect with listeners and, of course, make more money from them. More specifically, the company plans on creating virtual 3D spaces for music fans to attend concerts and listening parties, in addition to creating a sales platform for musicians and labels to sell merch. This isn’t the worst idea in the world, as attending these kinds of shared events is probably my favorite aspect of VR. It&#39;s not clear what will happen with the existing Napster service; for now, it doesn&#39;t appear it&#39;ll go away immediately. While it offers a similarly massive catalog to what you&#39;ll find on industry leaders Spotify and Apple Music as well as others, the service isn&#39;t really top-of-mind anymore.&nbsp; &quot;The most legendary collab?! Infinite Reality has acquired iconic online music brand @Napster . With this acquisition, we&#39;re expanding and reimagining Napster, empowering artists with new audience monetization and engagement capabilities, underpinned by iR’s #immersive … pic.twitter.com/L4Fig7QFct — Infinite Reality (@Infinite_iR) March 25, 2025 “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” Acunto said. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.” Napster holds numerous licenses to stream millions of songs, which is what made it an attractive prospect to Infinite Reality. The company says its version of Napster will “disrupt legally.” Current Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos says that the purchase will allow artists to create “crazy environments that are really only limited by their imaginations.” As an example, he described a reggae artist who might enjoy a virtual beach environment. Acunto adds that it’ll be like “Clubhouse times a trillion.” He’s referring to the virtual events app that became popular during COVID , but eventually petered out. Infinite Reality has been on a buying spree the last couple of years. In addition to Napster, it purchased the Drone Racing League , the metaverse marketing platform Landvault and the VR shopping platform Obsess . As for Napster, it started in 1999 and took the world by storm, creating an easy-peasy way to steal music. It only took a couple of years for mounting legal battles to catch up to the platform and it declared bankruptcy in 2001. However, that was just the beginning . The software company Roxio purchased the platform in 2002 and relaunched it as a legitimate e-commerce venture that sold digital music files. In 2008, Best Buy came calling and scooped it up. The retail giant only held on to Napster for a few years before selling to Rhapsody in 2011 . Rhapsody tried to make Napster a household name in Europe for the next decade before a consortium of blockchain companies, led by Hivemind and Algorand, bought it in 2022 . These companies had plans to do some kind of NFT-based nonsense, because “music x web3 is one of the most exciting spaces.” That didn’t work and, well, here we are. Here’s to another 25 years of being passed around like a hot potato. Update, March 26 2025, 10:43AM ET: This story was updated with more details about Infinite Reality&#39;s plans for Napster.

    "description": "As someone who paid full price for Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM5 headphones , I am jealous to report that they are 20 percent off right now as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . Yes, our choice for 2025&#39;s best wireless headphones have dropped to $318 from $400 — a 20 percent discount. They briefly dropped to $250 earlier in the sale, but have since jumped back up a bit. Nevertheless, this is a good sale price overall; you can grab them on discount in either the silver of smoky pink colors. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones are one of them. I&#39;ve raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they&#39;re so comfortable. I&#39;ve worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp; Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they&#39;re a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don&#39;t have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp; Their excellence on flights isn&#39;t the only reason we gave Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones a 95 in our review . They&#39;re also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound&#39;s quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don&#39;t fold up, but especially at this price, they&#39;re still such a great buy.&nbsp; This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don&#39;t quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

    "description": "Breville makes some of our favorite kitchen tech , and now thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , you can get a top pick air fryer for much less than usual. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is currently on sale for $280, which is $70 off its usual price. That&#39;s close to the lowest price we&#39;ve seen on this air fryer toaster oven, a version of which has been a top pick of ours for a long time. Breville’s Smart Oven Air Fryer combines convection baking and air frying into a single, compact appliance. It features Element iQ system technology, which intelligently adjusts heat distribution to ensure precise and even cooking. Whether you’re roasting a chicken, crisping up fries or baking cookies, this oven is designed to handle it all. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer has 11 cooking functions, including toast, bake, roast, broil, air fry, and pizza, making it a versatile tool for any kitchen. While throwing down close to $300 might seem steep, you have to consider how flexible this oven is, plus how good of a deal you can get right now. Air fryers have become convenient alternatives to ovens thanks to the speed at which you can cook with them. The Breville Smart Air Fryer is no different; its super convection technology speeds up cooking times while delivering that golden, crispy finish we all love. The LCD display and easy-to-use dials make navigating the settings simple, while the spacious interior can fit a 13-inch pizza or six slices of toast at once — handy when you have a big family or crowd to feed. If you want even more features and are prepared to part with a little more cash, the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro is also on sale for $320, down from its usual $400. In our roundup of the best air fryers , we consider it the best air fryer toaster oven thanks to its extra cooking presets, a larger capacity and dehydration capabilities, making it an even better choice for those who frequently cook in bulk.

    "description": "Microsoft has launched two new &quot;reasoning agents&quot; for Copilot that were designed to analyze vast amounts of work data, including emails, meetings, chats and documents. The first tool called &quot;Researcher&quot; is based on OpenAI&#39;s deep research model combined with Copilot&#39;s advanced orchestration and deep search capabilities. Researcher was made for &quot;complex, multi-step research&quot; at work. It can take a user&#39;s internal work data along with additional information from the web, such as competitive data, emerging trends and the latest market analysis, to create market strategies and comprehensive quarterly reports, among other potential uses. Plus, it can pull data from Salesforce, ServiceNow and other external sources. Meanwhile, the new &quot;Analyst&quot; tool was built to function like a skilled data scientist. It&#39;s based on OpenAI&#39;s o3-mini reasoning model and uses &quot;chain-of-thought reasoning&quot; to solve issues in multiple steps to provide answers that Microsoft says &quot;mirror human analytical thinking.&quot; It can process raw data across multiple spreadsheets to, say, predict future revenue and expenses, forecast demand for a new product and visualize the purchasing patterns of customers. For the most complex data queries, it can run Python, and users will be able to view the code while it&#39;s running in real time.&nbsp; Both Researcher and Analyst will be rolling out to customers with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license starting in April as part of &quot;Frontier.&quot; Customers enrolled to the new Frontier program will get access to Copilot technologies while they&#39;re still in development, starting with these two new tools.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-deep-research-and-analysis-tools-for-copilot-143001894.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals: Save up to $200 on AirPods, iPads and more",

    "description": "Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is into its second day, and though the event is nowhere near as heavy on tech as Black Friday or Prime Day, we’ve still managed to find a few noteworthy discounts on Apple devices. If you’re in the market for a new iPad, Apple Watch or pair of AirPods, we’ve rounded up the best Apple deals going on right now. In truth, most of the offers below aren’t tied to the Spring Sale specifically, but they still drop a number of Apple (and Beats) gadgets we recommend to lower prices than usual. As a refresher, Amazon says this sale will run through March 31, and the deals we&#39;ve dug up below aren&#39;t exclusive to Prime members. Best Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $149 ($30 off MSRP) : This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple’s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn’t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a score of 86 in our review. This discount is $11 higher than the best price we’ve seen, but it’s about as low as the earbuds have fallen outside of that. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. Also at Best Buy . The Apple Watch Series 10. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off) : The top pick in our guide to the best smartwatches , the Series 10 is a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer profile and a marginally larger display compared to the previous Series 9. That said, it remains a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. It should be a welcome upgrade if you’re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch (think pre-Series 7) — just keep in mind a patent dispute has locked it out the blood oxygen detection features found on those older models. This $100 discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the non-cellular model with a 42mm case. Also at Best Buy and Walmart . Apple iPad (A16) for $329 ($20 off) : The newest entry-level iPad only arrived three weeks ago, but Amazon is currently selling it for $20 less than Apple direct, which is a decent little savings if you planned on grabbing the tablet early anyway. This one is another small update, but it now comes with a faster A16 chip, more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for media consumption and lighter work, it&#39;s still a fine value. Also at B&amp;H and Best Buy . Apple iPad Air 11-inch (M3) for $549 ($50 off) : Much like the deal on the base iPad above, this isn’t a huge discount, but it’s a nice chance to save a few bucks compared to buying from Apple directly. The new iPad Air was released on the same day as the iPad (A16) and is a similarly minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still prefer the Air over the base model if you can swing it: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. The older M2-powered model is an even better value if you can find it on sale, but either way the Air is the iPad we recommend to most people. Also at B&amp;H , Best Buy and Walmart . The 13-inch iPad Air M3. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $738 ($61 off) : We gave the 13-inch iPad Air a review score of 89 earlier this month. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 128GB model. Also at Walmart . Apple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off) : The iPad Pro is more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being how expensive it all is. This deal on doesn’t truly lessen that — and it’s another deal we’ve seen multiple times in recent months — but it still ties the 13-inch model’s all-time low.

    "title": "Noble Audio FoKus Apollo review: The high price of pristine audio",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html?src=rss",
    "description": "I don’t review a lot of $650 headphones . That’s because most audio companies sell their top-of-the-line gear around $300-$400. Noble Audio isn’t like most companies. The FoKus Rex5 earbuds, for example, cram in five separate drivers where much of the competition uses two at the most. Noble was also among the first to employ xMEMS drivers in wireless earbuds in a bid to improve bass performance. Enter the FoKus Apollo , a $649 pair of active noise canceling (ANC) headphones with a detachable boom mic and up to 80 hours of battery life. The real star of the show is the driver setup , which Noble says is the first time this configuration appears in wireless headphones. The company is once again on a quest for the absolute best sound quality, but it may sacrifice a little too much along the way. Sound quality is the main attraction Noble Audio’s proposition is simple: the “world’s first” headphones that offer a hybrid speaker pairing of a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar magnetic driver. A dynamic driver is nothing new for a set of cans, but adding the latter makes the FoKus Apollo’s audio setup unique. For the uninitiated, planar magnetic drivers have a thin, flat diaphragm that typically offers a wider, more immersive soundstage and enhanced detail compared to dynamic drivers. Planar magnetic drivers are typically reserved for audiophile-grade headphones since they’re larger and more fragile. With the FoKus Apollo, Noble capitalized on the best of both worlds for the stock tuning. You get the bass power of a dynamic driver with the clarity of a planar magnetic driver. Since planar magnetic units can’t move enough air for the robust bass that most of us crave, and as dynamic drivers are limited with mid- and high-range details, the company argues it has created the optimal solution. From the first second of the first song, I could tell the FoKus Apollo was built differently. The addition of planar magnetic drivers offers the most bass-heavy genres an almost absurd amount of detail. Albums like Spiritbox’s Tsunami Sea that lack clarity on other headphones greatly benefit from the treble boost, serving up more nuance in the guitar riffs and texture in the kick drum blasts. The FoKus Apollo also excels with mellow styles, allowing you to hear every bit of sound coming from the acoustic guitars, banjo, bass and more on Julien Baker &amp; TORRES’ “Sugar in the Tank.” Going from most over-ear headphones to the FoKus Apollo is like going from standard music streaming to vinyl. And I don’t think that’s hyperbole. FoKus Apollo in-use: ANC, battery life and more Billy Steele for Engadget A pair of $649 ANC headphones better damn well provide some decent noise cancellation, even if you’re primarily buying them for the audio performance. Noble opted for a hybrid ANC setup with three microphones on each side and a Qualcomm QCC3084 chip. That processor provides the necessary digital signal processing (DSP) and algorithms to reduce background distractions. Like a lot of ANC headphones, the FoKus Apollo struggles with voices. That means any hopes of silencing a chatty colleague won’t pan out. However, the headphones do a solid job with constant noise sources — fans, appliances, noise machines, etc. — so they do offer some relief. The noise-blocking prowess isn’t as good as the likes of Bose , but I found ample room to focus during my test sessions. While the ANC here isn’t among the best, it’s perfectly serviceable in most environments. Noble promises a whopping 60 hours of battery life with ANC enabled, with another 20 hours of use if you turn it off. I found that those figures hold true during my time with the FoKus Apollo. After 30 hours of music, podcasts and work calls with noise cancellation active, the headphones still had 57 percent battery remaining — tracking slightly better than the company’s stated numbers. The Fokus Apollo comes with all the accessories you’d ever need right in the box. Noble includes a detachable boom mic, 3.5mm to 4.4mm adapter, two-prong airline adapter, USB-C cable and 3.5mm aux cable. The headphones can be used with either of those two cords, and the company recommends you do so when employing the microphone for optimal voice quality. If you’re planning to use the Fokus Apollo for calls, you can expect mixed results. In quiet spaces with little echo, you’ll sound good enough for a professional presentation. When you move to a room with some natural reverb, the mics on these headphones pick that up a little too well. What’s more, they’re not great at blocking background sounds, as fans, white noise machines and raucous appliances were all clearly heard on the other end during my tests. Design that matches the sound The FoKus Apollo is really expensive, so Noble couldn’t just give us a set of headphones built mostly out of plastic and call it a day. Thankfully, the company chose a mix of anodized aluminum, premium protein leather and a soft Alcantara headband. The leather-wrapped memory foam ear pads are replaceable, which will extend the life of the headphones under heavy use. There’s also a nice textured cloth pattern on the outside of the ear cups and headband that provide both tactile and visual contrast. Noble Audio provides physical controls on the FoKus Apollo, so you’ll never have to struggle with tap or touch gestures to make changes. On the right side, there’s a dedicated button for ANC modes (on, off and transparency) with a three-control array just below it. Here, the top and bottom buttons handle the volume and track adjustments while the center one is used for power, Bluetooth pairing, play/pause and to summon Google Assistant, Siri or some other virtual helper. On the left ear cup, a single slider allows you to mute all the microphones, even the boom when it’s attached, without reaching for your phone or keyboard. The lack of advanced features Billy Steele for Engadget The FoKus Apollo is really only focused on the basics, so it doesn’t offer any of today’s advanced features. Heck, there aren’t even tools that have been on other sets for years — like wear detection. Although you’ll get support for Sony’s LDAC codec along with AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC, there’s no mention of Dolby Atmos or any form of spatial audio. You don’t find any discussion of adaptive audio or adaptive ANC that makes automatic adjustments to both overall sound and noise cancellation either. Look, I’m well aware the premise here is pristine sound quality above all else. But at $649, which is $100 more than the AirPods Max by the way, I expect some degree of convenience that allows me to keep these headphones on for most of the day. Automatic pausing or wear detection should be standard at this price and it would be nice to have some additional sound/ANC options. I’m not picky about whether those are the automatic, adaptive type, or whether they’re settings I have to toggle on in the app. Just, please, give me something more than EQ adjustments when your sound out of the box is already incredible. The competition Once you hit $500 and above, you’ve surpassed what most companies charge for their flagship-level wireless headphones. You’re also in a price range where I’ve only reviewed a handful of models. If money is no object, the $699 Px8 from Bowers &amp; Wilkins delivers excellent sound quality in a design that might be preferable to some folks (there’s at least multiple color options). Its ANC performance isn’t earth shattering either, and one of my biggest gripes with the company’s products is the lack of advanced features like the FoKus Apollo. There’s also the AirPods Max and Dyson On-Trac , but neither of those are easy to recommend. Apple’s over-ear headphones have barely been updated since they arrived in 2020, except for an upgrade to USB-C and the upcoming addition of lossless audio . Dyson’s headphones have long battery life and a unique design, but they didn’t impress me sound-wise, have average ANC performance and lack the modern features I expect for $500. I also need to mention Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW75 in the over-$500 discussion. If you’re after high-end looks, no other company consistently nails its trademark aesthetic like M&amp;D. True to its lineage, the company pairs leather and metal on these headphones, along with tempered glass panels on the outside of the earcups. I’ve always enjoyed the balance of M&amp;D’s stock tuning and the ANC performance is solid. You won’t get any advanced features here either, but like the Px8, there are multiple color options if you’re after something other than Noble’s black and silver paint scheme. Wrap-up I have no doubts there are a lot of people that will thoroughly enjoy the FoKus Apollo . If you crave the absolute best sound quality on the market, these headphones are the best I’ve tested in that regard. For me, to pay $649 I expect more in terms of features. The first item would be better ANC performance, but I don’t feel like spatial audio support and wear detection are too much to ask. Even without any of that, you do get a novel driver setup that produces some ridiculously detailed sound across diverse genres.

    "description": "If you&#39;ve been contemplating an E Ink tablet, one of our top picks has received a good discount thanks to Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . The second-gen Kindle Scribe is on sale for $325, down from $399 — that&#39;s a 19 percent discount. Digital notebooks like the Scribe can give you the convenience of a connected device with the old-school feel of writing with pen and paper. The new Amazon Kindle Scribe received an 86 in our review thanks to its nice design, AI enhancements and excellent reading and writing experience. It also comes with a Premium Pen that has a rubberized top to symbolize an eraser. Our biggest quip was its cost, but that&#39;s somewhat less concerning thanks to this discount. The Scribe isn&#39;t the only Kindle discounted for the Amazon Spring Sale. You can grab the Kindle Colorsoft for $225 right now, which is 20 percent off its usual going rate. If you&#39;ve been keen on getting a Kindle with a color display so you can better read comics, manga and the like, the Colorsoft is your only option. We enjoyed the colors that the screen can produce, plus its a zippy ereader a handy auto-adjusting front light and a solid 32GB of storage.

    "description": "It&#39;s day two of Amazon&#39;s Big Spring Sale , and while the week-long event is mostly focused on categories like apparel and outdoor goods, it still includes a handful of discounts on electronics. Per usual with these big Amazon events, most of those aren’t anything special. But if you’re on a budget and looking to grab a new gadget on the cheap, we’ve checked price histories and dug up a few actually decent tech deals that are priced below $50. Some of the discounts have technically been available for a few days, but the offers include several devices we recommend in our various buying guides . Note that the sale will run through March 31, and that you don&#39;t need to be a Prime member to access any of the offers below.&nbsp; Best Amazon Spring Sale deals under $50 Anker PowerConf C200 for $48 ($12 off MSRP) : The PowerConf C200 is our favorite webcam for those on a tighter budget due to its crisp video quality, easy setup, solid microphones and built-in privacy cover. Its USB cable is on the shorter side, and it can’t match the overall accuracy of our top pick, but it’s still a clear upgrade over a built-in laptop camera for a much lower price. This is another deal we’ve seen numerous times in the last year, but it’s as low as the camera usually goes. Also at Anker . Anker 525 Charging Station for $30 ($36 off) : We recommend this reliable desktop charging station in our remote worker gift guide . It can’t provide the absolute fastest charge to your smartphone or laptop (topping out at a quick enough 67W), but it packs four USB ports — two USB-C, two USB-A — and three AC outlets in a frame that’s small enough to fit on a crowded desk. This deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . The Anker 525 Charging Station. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anker Nano Charger 30W for $13 ($10 off) : It’s hard to have too many portable wall chargers on standby. This one from Anker should be particularly useful for traveling: At just over an inch thick, it’s small enough to fit in a pocket, while its 30W USB-C port is enough to top up recent iPhones at full speed. (That’s not enough for some newer Android phones , though.) This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . Amazon Music Unlimited 3-month trial for free ($24 off) : Amazon is offering new subscribers three months of its Music Unlimited streaming service for free. Normally, it gives new users a one-month trial. Though Music Unlimited isn’t a top pick in our guide to the best music services , it still gets you lossless streaming quality and an extensive library of both music and podcasts. You could do worse if you just want to bum a few months of music streaming for no cost. Just note that your subscription will auto-renew once the trial period ends until you cancel. The Blink Mini 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Blink Mini 2 for $20 ($20 off) : This deal ties the lowest price to date for the Blink Mini 2, which is the budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras . This one comes with its share of trade-offs for the low price — its image quality isn’t the best, it locks certain features behind a paywall and it won’t automatically arm when you leave the house — but it still provides functional 1080p video, color night vision, motion alerts and Alexa support in a weather-resistant frame. It’s fairly simple to set up, too, though you’ll need to buy an external module if you want to store clips locally. Also at Best Buy , Lowe&#39;s and The Home Depot . Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Unlike the AirTag, it can also attach directly to a keychain. It probably isn’t the safest choice for long-distance travel, but it’s a convenient security blanket if you, say, leave your keys or wallet behind at a restaurant. This is another discount that’s been available for a few weeks, but it’s just 10 cents more the best price we’ve seen.

    "description": "Anker power banks and other charging gear have been discounted thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . Noteworthy among the deals is this Anker 321 MagGo power bank that&#39;s going for only $20 for Prime members. The discount applies to all colorways, too, including white, black, pink, green and purple. Anker devices are some of our favorites and a few of them have made it onto our list of the best power banks and portable chargers. This particular model on sale is MagSafe-compatible, so it will magnetically attach to the back of your iPhone when you need a power-up. It&#39;s also compatible with MagSafe iPhone cases, too. Inside, there’s a 5,000mAh battery that provides up to 19 hours of additional use for modern iPhones. It’s equipped with heat sensors that continuously monitor temperatures to avoid accidental damage and it can juice up a phone while it’s being charged itself. This power bank is also on the smaller side, so it easily fits into pockets, bags and purses. The only downside is that this is only for Prime members. However, the Anker Nano 3-in-1 portable charger is on sale for everyone. This non-magnetic charger includes a large 10,000mAh battery and is currently $35 . Even some of Anker&#39;s latest power banks and chargers that it debuted at CES have discounts as part of the Spring Sale as well.

    "description": "This year’s Amazon Spring Sale is in full swing, and as promised, a ton of household, fashion and outdoor gear has dropped to record-low prices. Tech isn’t a huge focus for this sale, but there are a decent number of devices on sale right now for some of the best prices we’ve seen all year. The selection may not be as good as that of Amazon Prime Day in July, but it still provides a good opportunity to save on things like headphones, robot vacuums, air purifiers and more. We’ve collected the best Amazon Spring Sale deals on tech gear here so you don’t have to go searching for them. The Spring Sale runs through March 31, so check back here for all of the latest deals as they drop. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals 10th-gen iPad for $269 (23 percent off): The previous version of most affordable iPad gives you an A14 Bionic chip, a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, TouchID built into the lock button and more. It’s compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the keyboard folio, plus we found it to have solid performance and a matching battery life. Dyson AM09 heater and fan for $300 (36 percent off): The AM09 has been around for ages, and for good reason. It&#39;s an excellent heater during cold months and fan during warm months, so you can use it all year round. Jet Focus control lets you choose from Focused or Diffused for personal or whole-room heating or cooling, and the handy sleep timer lets you set when the device turns off in intervals from 15 minutes up to nine hours. Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $318 (20 percent off): These top our list of the best wireless headphones you can get right now thanks to their supreme comfort, excellent sound quality and ANC, multipoint connectivity and 30-hour battery life. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. A quick-charge feature will net you 2.5 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging, so you&#39;ll rarely have to go without them, too. Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones for $349 ($80 off): These hold the top spot in our best wireless headphones guide for excellent noise cancellation. These cans will give you a step up in ANC, blocking out most noise and chatter of those around you. General audio quality has been improved as well, and they have a comfy fit. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off): A version of one of our favorite air fryers , this air fryer toaster oven has 11 cooking modes including air fry, broil, bake, roast and more, and it has a large capacity that can fit up to six slices of bread at once or a 13-inch pizza. The Pro model is also on sale, down to $320 from $400. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off): This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $20 (43 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget streaming device can play content at 1080p/60fps and now its remote can also control your TV&#39;s power and volume. There&#39;s also Alexa support built into the remote, so you can use voice commands to search for content. Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $169 ($80 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you&#39;re on the market for a new desktop, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Beats Studio Pro for $180 (49 percent off): These Beats headphones have improved sound quality, good Transparency mode and USB-C charging, plus decent mic quality for phone calls. They support wired USB-C audio, plus they have solid ANC as well. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Blink Mini 2 for $20 (50 percent off): Blink&#39;s latest wired, indoor security camera is one of our favorites , particularly if you&#39;re just starting out building a security camera system. It&#39;s easy to set up and use, and it works seamlessly with Amazon&#39;s Alexa. Plus, if you want a local storage option, you can buy the Blink Sync Module 2 and a thumb drive to store video clips locally. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 ($30 off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. Levoit Core 400S air purifier for $190 ($30 off with coupon): Our top pick for the best air purifier for most people, the Core 400S has easy-to-use onboard controls, powerful filtering technology that isn&#39;t too loud and relatively affordable replacement filters. It reliably improved air quality in our testing, and even though its mobile app is a little overstuffed, it gives you another way to control and monitor the device. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "description": "No Man’s Sky already lets players dig deep into the terrain of its near-infinite universe of planets, but now there will actually be cool stuff to find. Hello Games just announced general availability of a new update called Relics that brings a bit of Indiana Jones to everyone’s favorite space exploration sim. The update lets players &quot;feel like true paleontologists&quot; as they dig up the “skeletal remains of alien creatures.” When bones are discovered, folks can piece them together to match their own design aspirations. The game will also allow players to create museums and share collections with other players. Hello Games Hello Games boasts that there is a &quot;truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes.&quot; There’s a rarity system in place, with the most uncommon finds holding a &quot;huge value.&quot; If digging gets a bit tiresome, the developer has placed a fossil specialist at space stations that can be bartered with. However, digging up bones comes with a major risk, as &quot;things have been buried for a reason.&quot; Some of the rarest items are guarded by dangerous creatures like Stone Ghosts, the colossal Stone Golem and something called a Titan Worm.

    "description": "The last few years have seen an ongoing debate over what rights AI companies have to utilize copyrighted material . The latest development tips the scales in favor of use: A judge has rejected Universal Music Group, ABKCO and other music publishers&#39; preliminary bid to block Anthropic from using their lyrics to train its AI assistant Claude, Reuters reports .&nbsp; US District Judge Eumi Lee ruled that UMG and co had submitted too broad a request and failed to demonstrate that Anthropic&#39;s use of the lyrics caused the companies &quot;irreparable harm.&quot; Lee stated, &quot;Publishers are essentially asking the Court to define the contours of a licensing market for AI training where the threshold question of fair use remains unsettled.&quot; The case dates back to 2023, when UMG joined some of its fellow music publishers in suing Anthropic for copyright infringement. They claimed that Anthropic used and distributed copyrighted material, including at least 500 songs. &quot;Anthropic’s copyright infringement is not innovation; in layman’s terms, it’s theft,&quot; UMG stated at the time.&nbsp; The two sides came to a partial agreement in January of this year. Anthropic confirmed it would maintain current guardrails for reproducing, displaying or distributing copyrighted material.

    "title": "iPad (2025) with A16 review: No Apple Intelligence, no problem",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html?src=rss",
    "description": "When it debuted in 2022, Apple’s 10th-generation iPad sat in something of a no-man’s land, bringing a long-overdue design revamp at an inflated price. A year and a half later, Apple gave the slate a $100 price cut and immediately turned it into a much more enticing value . Now, the company has quietly released a follow-up. Dubbed the iPad (A16) , the new tablet is a far less dramatic update, one with welcome performance improvements that otherwise refuses to rock the boat. It even lacks the Apple Intelligence features Apple has endlessly promoted over the past year. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Compared to the iPad Air, iPad Pro and iPad mini, this might be the easiest Apple tablet to grok — it’s the cheapest, it only comes in one size and it’s clearly designed for the core iPad Things. That doesn’t make it a slam dunk, though. What hasn’t changed Almost everything about the latest iPad is identical to the previous entry-level iPad from 2022, which brought many of the iPad Air’s features down to a lower price. The design is unchanged, with the same dimensions, weight, bezels, display and aluminum finish as before. Apple now lists the screen as being 11 inches instead of 10.9 inches, but it’s merely rounding up for marketing purposes — the size is no different. There are still competent 12-megapixel cameras on the front and back, with the selfie cam conveniently located along the device’s long edge for FaceTime calls. The same reliable Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the power button in lieu of Face ID. Two speakers, one on either end, sit behind a (misleading) quartet of grilles, while a lone USB-C port continues to max out at basic USB 2.0 transfer speeds. There’s no difference in accessory support either, and the whole thing is available in the same bold colors: blue, pink, yellow or silver. Battery life, meanwhile, still checks in at around 10 hours per charge, give or take a few depending on how you push it. I got 11 hours and 19 minutes out of the slate after playing a 1080p movie on loop at roughly 70 percent brightness and volume (and with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth disabled). Gaming and media editing will naturally sap it faster. Most of this is still perfectly fine for a $349 tablet. The last iPad was a light and comfortable slab, with a substantial aluminum finish and flat sides that made it feel modern. This one is no different. And iPadOS is still a level above Android and Windows tablets when it comes to app and game support, long-term updates and features optimized for large displays. But if the 10th-gen iPad was a “tick” update, the iPad (A16) is clearly a “tock.” That said, there are some important changes, namely a faster chip, more memory and higher storage options, plus a few minor tweaks like Smart HDR 4 processing for photos and support for Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.2. It’s a spec bump through and through, with most of those tweaks being for the better, although I do think that some of the things that haven’t been touched could really use an update next time. A faster chip and more RAM As the name implies, the latest iPad’s headline upgrade is its A16 chip. This is a slightly weaker version of the A16 Bionic found in 2022’s iPhone 14 Pro and the regular iPhone 15 from 2023. Compared to that SoC, this A16 has five CPU cores instead of six and four GPU cores instead of five. But in practice, it’s still more than fast enough for the vast majority of things people do with iPads: browsing the web, streaming video, reading ebooks, viewing and editing photos, playing most games and the like. I tested this iPad against my personal 13-inch iPad Air M2 for much of this review, and the two consistently booted up and loaded popular apps at virtually the same speed. The few times the Air M2 was quicker, the difference wasn’t long enough to be significant. Geekbench 6 results back this up: The iPad (A16) earned a single-core CPU score of 2,582, while the iPad Air M2 was only marginally better at 2,632. This is a roughly 20 percent jump from the 10th-gen iPad, though the most recent iPad Air M3 still measures about 16-18 percent faster. But for media consumption and common work tasks, it won’t feel slow anytime soon. These performance gains are helped by the 6GB of RAM, which is 2GB more than the last model and twice as much as the 9th-gen iPad from 2021. While this is still 2GB short of the iPad Air and lower-spec iPad Pros, getting more memory for the same price is always a good thing: It lets the tablet hang onto apps and Safari tabs longer before it has to start refreshing things for new tasks. It will only improve the chances of the device holding up four or five years down the road, too. Where the iPad (A16) lags behind its higher-end siblings is multi-core and graphics performance. In Geekbench 6, the tablet’s multi-core CPU score was about 40 percent below the iPad Air M2 (6,185 vs. 10,006), while its GPU score was about 55 percent worse (19,448 vs. 42,920). Other graphics benchmarks were largely the same: It scored about 60 percent lower than the Air M2 in 3DMark’s Wild Life Extreme test (with an average of 15.2 fps vs. 37.6 fps) and anywhere between 45 to 55 percent worse on GFXBench ’s Aztec Ruins benchmark, depending on the resolution. Of course, the difference will be a little greater with the newer iPad Air M3. This sounds more dramatic on paper than it does in real life. Many everyday iPad workloads won’t tax the chip’s multi-core abilities all that hard, and the scores above are still a good 15 to 30 percent higher than the last entry-level iPad. I could still play Call of Duty Mobile at its highest settings (120 fps mode aside) without any hitches. Diablo Immortal warned that maxing out its settings would put the device under “high” load — with the Air M2, it only goes up to “medium” load — but I still got through the opening areas totally fine. (It does seem to drain the battery a bit faster, though.) You can still edit RAW photos in Lightroom or create music in GarageBand without major frustration. The iPad (A16) on top of a 13-inch iPad Air. Still, the Air is better if you ever want to push things further. This is easiest to see in the newest and most taxing iPadOS games. With Infinity Nikki , for instance, playing at ultra or high settings on the new iPad brought a constant bit of choppiness and some slowdowns during more involved animations. It also warmed up the device’s back and drained the battery faster. The game was still totally playable at medium settings, but there’s less need to knock it down on the iPad Air M2, where it looked sharper and ran smoother at high settings. Likewise, the Air will be noticeably quicker to export higher-res videos in apps like Adobe Premiere Rush. Arguably, the main benefit of the iPad Air’s M-series chip and extra RAM has less to do with today than it does the future. Features like Apple Intelligence and the Stage Manager multitasking mode aren’t available here, nor are some especially demanding games . Those aren’t essential right now — though omitting Stage Manager does make the device more cumbersome to use with an external display — but there’ll always be some risk that the next great iPadOS feature or power-hungry game won’t work (or work as well ) with this entry-level model. More storage — hallelujah The best improvement with the iPad (A16) is also the simplest: It now starts with 128GB of storage, which is twice as much as the last model. There’s also a new 512GB option for $649. There isn’t much to say about this besides “good.” It’s a common-sense upgrade that makes the tablet a much safer long-term investment than its predecessor, especially when there’s no hope of Apple ever letting us upgrade storage manually. A fine display, but it’s time to improve In his iPad Air M3 review , my colleague Nathan Ingraham argued that it’s time for Apple to update the Air’s display with a higher refresh rate or a mini LED panel , as the OLED tech exclusive to the iPad Pros represents a major upgrade on its own. Since the iPad (A16)’s screen is no different than the last one, I want to make a follow-up case for the entry-level model, albeit on a smaller scale. It&#39;s much easier to see in person than through photos, but if you look at the bottom corner of the display, near the bezel, you can see the air gap between the iPad&#39;s LCD panel and front glass. Out of context, the IPS display here is still totally adequate. It’s comfortably sized, it’s sharp enough, it’s not a massive smudge magnet and it doesn’t have any serious color accuracy issues. A tablet is nothing if not a big display, and most of the people Apple is targeting with this one will still enjoy watching and reading stuff on it. I can also live with the 60Hz refresh rate — that’s the minimum in 2025, but it’s a harsher limitation on a $599 ( or $799 ) tablet like the iPad Air than a $349 device. The other restrictions are more annoying. This screen still isn’t laminated, most notably, which means there’s a visible air gap between the LCD panel and the glass above. This helps the screen’s repairability but makes it look cheaper and feel more distant when you interact with the glass. This is particularly discernible with the Apple Pencil: Writing out notes on the iPad Air is both quieter and more natural. Those who’ve never used a higher-end iPad probably won’t care, but once you notice the difference, you can’t unsee it. The display also lacks an anti-reflective coating, so it’s worse at fending off glare. It’s certainly not unusable outdoors, but you’ll see your reflection much more clearly on the iPad (A16) than you will on the iPad Air M2 in sunlight. You’re much more likely to have to angle its display to make things out. Unlike the iPad Air and iPad Pro, the base iPad isn’t tuned for the wider P3 color space either. While the difference in color reproduction between the iPad Air and iPad (A16) is nowhere near as dramatic as the one between the Air and the iPad Pro, colors on the Air can still look slightly bolder and less washed-out when you put the two side-by-side. I appreciate that Apple wants to keep its “good, better, best” hierarchy intact, but at this point the iPad Pro’s display is so far ahead of the rest of the lineup that there’s room to even things out. If the next Air can upgrade to 120Hz, as Nathan suggests, then the next entry-level iPad should at least have a laminated display with better glare protection. Those aren’t premium features anymore. The USB-C Pencil can attach magnetically but lacks wireless charging and pressure sensitivity, so it&#39;s not a great choice for more involved work. Continued weirdness with accessories Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard support is another ongoing pain point. Like its predecessor, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with the Pencil Pro (Apple’s best stylus) or the older, second-gen Pencil. That means the only stylus you can buy with pressure sensitivity — a key feature for digital artists that lets you make darker marks by pressing down harder — is the original Pencil, which is nearly a decade old (!), isn’t as comfortable as the newer models and can’t attach to the tablet magnetically. It also requires a USB-C cable and a USB-C to Lightning adapter to charge. All of this is bad . You can still get the $79 USB-C Pencil , which is nicer to hold and can attach to the iPad’s side magnetically but isn’t pressure-sensitive and still requires a separate cable to pair and charge. Really, though, most people who want an iPad for drawing should start with the iPad Air. I’ve never been a big fan of this iPad’s Magic Keyboard Folio either, as its Surface-style kickstand is hard to keep stable on your lap and it lacks backlit keys. That’s tough given its exorbitantly high price of $249. Not built for Apple Intelligence, but that’s OK (for now) As noted above, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with Apple Intelligence, which is Apple’s catch-all term for the suite of generative AI features it’s gradually rolled out since late last year. In fact, it’s the only major device Apple has released without the AI tools since they became available. Right now, though, you won’t miss much without them. Sure, the “ Clean Up ” feature that lets you scrub unwanted objects from photos is nice. Some of the writing-assistance tools are fine if you’re completely out of gas, and being able to access ChatGPT through Siri is convenient. But just as many of the tricks are either half-cooked or, let’s say, less than essential . A promised Siri revamp has been significantly delayed . If anything, many people will appreciate that their tablet won’t push AI onto them with every update. There’s always a chance Apple Intelligence becomes more useful down the road, and buying the iPad (A16) means locking yourself out of that potential future. But it’s not there yet , and Apple is reportedly well aware of that, so we can’t call it a major omission today. Wrap-up The iPad (A16) isn’t a massive leap forward from the last entry-level iPad, and some of its display and accessory quirks are getting long in the tooth. We still recommend stepping up to the iPad Air if you can swing it: It’s faster and more futureproof, with small but meaningful upgrades to the screen, better accessory support and speakers that sound less compressed. It’s also worth the upgrade if you want to use your iPad as a pseudo laptop replacement without spending top dollar. If you see a great deal on refurbished iPad Air M2 , that’s a good buy as well. But for $250 less than the latest Air, the iPad (A16) does well to meet most iPad users where they live. It’s largely well-built and plenty quick for reading, watching and playing things, with solid battery life and an eternally easy-to-use OS. If you’re upgrading from a 9th-gen iPad or older, buying for a kid or just looking for a competent slate you won’t use for hours every day, it should be plenty of tablet for your needs. It’s not the most delightful iPad, but it’s good enough for the masses.

    "description": "Block has laid off 931 workers, which make up around eight percent of its entire staff, according to TechCrunch and The Guardian . The publications have viewed an email, wherein the financial technology company&#39;s co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, has discussed the latest organizational changes. Dorsey said that Block is eliminating roles based on three areas, starting with strategy. The company is letting 391 people go, because it&#39;s reducing &quot;teams that are off strategy.&quot; It&#39;s also parting ways with 460 workers who scored a &quot;below&quot; rating or are trending towards a &quot;below&quot; rating in its internal performance tracking metrics. Finally, Block is laying off 80 managers, as well as moving 193 to individual contributor roles, to flatten the organization and remove layers of middle management between workers and the high-level bosses they&#39;d now have to report to. In his email, Dorsey denied that the layoffs were made to hit any specific financial target and headcount goal, or because the company was replacing workers with artificial intelligence. He said that it was all about strategy and because flattening its org will allow it to &quot;move faster and with less abstraction.&quot; The CEO admitted, however, that everyone in Block has equity in the company and that the reorganization &quot;will help [it] focus and execute better to do just that.&quot; Block&#39;s stock prices have plummeted by around 30 percent this year.&nbsp; Dorsey explained that the company is laying off nearly 1,000 workers all at once instead of over time, because it&#39;s behind in its actions. &quot;We need to move to help us meet and stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in,&quot; he wrote. In addition to the layoffs, Block is also closing 748 previously open jobs and is only leaving key leadership and critical roles, along with those that have already progressed to offer stage, open. Block, which owns Square and Cash App, also underwent a reorganization in early 2024. It laid off nearly 1,000 people back then, as well, to make the company leaner and to limit its headcount to around 12,000 workers. As TechCrunch notes, Block had around 11,300 workers around the world by December 2024, which means its headcount is now far below the original goal it set for itself in 2023.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/block-reportedly-lays-off-almost-1000-employees-130056952.html?src=rss",

    "description": "There’s a good chance learning a new language is one of your New Year’s resolutions, unless you’re hoping Google Translate will be enough for your next international adventure. Either way, you’ll need a reliable method to guide you through speaking and understanding the foreign language of your choosing. Fortunately, we're no longer confined to flashcards and textbooks as you can learn using your phone from the comfort of your couch. Many of the best language learning apps today offer a multi-tier approach, with AI-powered conversations, extensive vocab libraries and even podcasts you can listen to to help you master your target language. Whether you're just starting because you're just trying to understand what Bad Bunny means when he says \"un verano en Nueva Yol ,\" or you want to brush up on your Korean before that planned vacation, there’s a language learning app to suit your needs. Best language learning apps for 2025 Others language learning apps we tested Memrise Memrise has a library of more than 200 languages to learn. From Spanish to isiXhosa, Memrise can teach you all the basics and dive into more regional differences. As a Spanish learner, I could choose to learn from Spain or Mexico and I enjoyed that Memrise didn’t just teach me a more generalized version of the language. While Memrise could be great for polyglots, its hefty $60 monthly fee was too steep and prevented it from gleaning one of our top slots. Pimsleur Dr. Pimsleur believed speaking and listening were key to learning a new language. This app allows you to take its audio lessons offline, even going as far as integrating into Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. As a commuter, I appreciated having a lesson or two stored away for my journey to the office. However, I wanted more ways to practice reading and writing. With other apps offering podcasts for listening along and other forms of teaching, Pimsleur didn’t offer enough to make our list. Rosetta Stone Gone are the large, yellow disc sets of yesteryear; now Rosetta Stone lives squarely in the digital age with its app. Using the same visual learning tools as the old-school Rosetta Stone, the app shows you pictures and terms to get you to understand what things mean. Users can repeat after voice recordings and match phrases to the images to learn slowly. Rosetta Stone could be great for beginners, but in order to get access to all 25 languages and a lifetime subscription, you’d have to dish out $400. There are cheaper apps on this list that provide comparable experiences. HelloTalk Similar to Discord, HelloTalk provides voice and chat rooms to talk to folks from different countries. Its users can learn regional terms and talk about cultural differences. With a paid subscription, you can practice with a tutor or their AI chatbot. If you’re looking to learn a new language outside of your inner circle, HelloTalk can be a great fit. I enjoyed connecting with others on the app, but, as always when meeting strangers online, beware — some users treat it like a dating app. Fortunately, there are apps on this list that offer a similar AI learning approach without that added concern. How we test language learning apps As an intermediate Spanish learner, I was looking for an app that best catered to my needs, but I know everyone learns differently. So for each app, I assessed based on several factors. Can beginners use this to gain confidence? Will advanced speakers feel challenged? Are there enough opportunities to test reading and writing skills? How many ways can you learn vocabulary words? For those who want to have more conversations, what opportunities did each app provide to speak in that language? Bonus points if an app helped you learn a bit of the culture surrounding that language.

    "description": "Whether you’re already an avid runner or hope to be one as you start a new training regimen, you’ll get more out of your exercise routine if you have some good music to accompany you. Getting into the zone during a long run with your preferred music, be it rap, classic rock or today’s pop hits, can totally change your experience for the better. To do that, you have to start with a good pair of running headphones. But not all wireless workout headphones are created equally, and runners need to consider specific factors before investing in a pair like how long your runs are, what type of music or other audio you prefer listening to and how much you want to block out the world during a session. I’ve tested out more than a dozen pairs to find which are the best headphones for running for all budgets and all kinds of runners. Table of contents Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones How we test headphones for running Others headphones for running we tested Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones Design Before diving in, it’s worth mentioning that this guide focuses on wireless earbuds . While you could wear over-ear or on-ear Bluetooth headphones during a run, most of the best headphones available now do not have the same level of durability. Water and dust resistance, particularly the former, is important for any audio gear you plan on sweating with or taking outdoors, and that’s more prevalent in the wireless earbuds world. Most earbuds have one of three designs: in-ear, in-ear with hook or open-ear. The first two are the most popular. In-ears are arguably the most common, while those with hooks promise better security and fit since they have an appendage that curls around the top of your ear. Open-ear designs don’t stick into your ear canal, but rather sit just outside of it. This makes it easier to hear the world around you while also listening to audio, and could be more comfortable for those who don’t like the intrusiveness of in-ear buds. Water resistance and dust protection Water resistance and dust protection are crucial for the best running headphones to have since you’ll likely be sweating while wearing them. Also, if you have the unfortunate luck of getting caught in the rain during a run, at least your gear will survive. Here’s a quick rundown of ingress protection (IP) ratings, which you’ll see attached to many earbuds on the market today. The first digit after the abbreviation rates dust protection on a scale from one to six — the higher, the better. The second digit refers to water- resistance, or waterproofing in some cases, ranked on a scale from one to nine. A letter “X” in either position means the device isn’t rated for the corresponding material. Check out this guide for an even more detailed breakdown. All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating (most have even more protection), which means they can withstand sweat and splashes but do not have dust protection. Active noise cancellation and transparency mode Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming a standard feature on wireless earbuds, at least in those above a certain price. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and continue to serve you when you’re off the trail, ANC is good to have. It adds versatility by allowing you to block out the hum of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute on public transit. But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand in hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many earbuds with ANC support some sort of “transparency mode” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for running headphones because you don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re exercising outside along busy streets. Lowering noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that. Battery life All of the earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most runners, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session. Speaking of, you’ll get an average of 20-28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a wireless charger to power up. How we test headphones for running When testing to determine the best running headphones, I wear each contender during as many runs as possible. I typically run three to five days each week, completing at least a 5K (3.01 miles) each time. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you’re on the tread or trail (as a note, I primarily run outside). I’m also paying attention to fit over time, particularly if the earbuds get slippery or loose while I sweat, or if they tend to pop out or feel less stable in my ears as I pick up speed or make quick movements. I also use the earbuds when not running to take calls and listen to music, podcasts and the like throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities. While I am also listening for audio quality, I’m admittedly not an expert in this space. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about sound quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and buying guides . Here, however, I will make note of audio-quality characteristics if they stood out to me (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’re able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases. A note about Jabra headphones Jabra announced that it will exit the consumer earbuds business , which is disappointing considering the company has made excellent headphones for running (and all other types of exercise). Our top picks include two Jabra models and we feel comfortable recommending them still because Jabra plans to support its current earbuds for &quot;several years.&quot; However, we&#39;re constantly testing new buds and reassessing our top picks, so we&#39;ll update this list accordingly in the future. Others headphones for running we tested Apple AirPods Pro The Apple AirPods Pro have an IP54 rating, which protects them from brief encounters with dust and splashes. While that’s more dust protection than many other earbuds we tested, it’s the same level of water-resistance that most exercise-specific competitors have. We generally like the AirPods Pro, but the Beats Fit Pro offer many of the same features and conveniences (namely good transparency mode and the H1 chip), with a design that’s more appropriate for working out. Beats Powerbeats Pro The Powerbeats Pro are a good alternative to the Beats Fit Pro if you’re a stickler for a hook design. However, they cost $50 more than the Fit Pro (although they’re often hovering around $180) and don’t offer any significant upgrades or additional features aside from their design. They’re also quite old at this point (having launched in 2019) and it appears Beats is putting more effort into updating its newer models instead. Anker Soundcore AeroFit Pro The Soundcore AeroFit Pro is Anker’s version of the Shokz OpenFit, but I found the fit to be less secure and not as comfortable. The actual earbuds on the AeroFit Pro are noticeably bulkier than those on the OpenFit and that caused them to shift and move much more during exercise. They never fell off of my ears completely, but I spent more time adjusting them than I did enjoying them. JBL Endurance Peak 3 The most noteworthy thing about the Endurance Peak 3 is that they have the same IP68 rating as the Jabra Elite 8 Active, except they only cost $100. But, while you get the same protection here, you’ll have to sacrifice in other areas. The Endurance Peak 3 didn’t blow me away when it came to sound quality or comfort (its hook is more rigid than those on my favorite similarly designed buds) and their charging case is massive compared to most competitors.

    "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on Disney+ and Hulu, Audible, Max and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in. Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This Amazon Spring Sale deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. The deal runs through April 30. Sling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange &amp; Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. Starz (six months) for $18 ($28 off): Starz&#39;s latest offer gives you six months of access for only $18, which shakes out to about $3 per month. This represents a 61-percent discount off the standard &quot;semi-annual&quot; plan, which puts six months of access up for $46. To get the offer, go to the Starz website and click on &quot;claim special offer.&quot; You&#39;ll have to provide your email address before the discounted rates appear. As an alternative, you could opt for the monthly plan discount, which is currently $3 per month for a total of three months. Paramount+ student discount - 50 percent off any plan: Ahead of March Madness , students can get half off any Paramount+ plan through April 8. To get the discount, scroll to the bottom of the Paramount+ homepage and click &quot;Get a 50% discount&quot; next to &quot;Are you a student?&quot; CBS shares broadcast rights with Warner Bros. Discovery this year for the men&#39;s tournament, so you&#39;ll be able to catch games on Paramount+ if you have the subscription tier that includes Showtime. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Fubo Essential for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, but Essential may be the best for most people. It offers access to 215 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. Note that regional sports content is not included here; you’ll have to go up to Pro or Elite plans for that. YouTube TV for $70/month for the first six months ($78 off): New subscribers can save a total of $78 when they sign up for YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Spotify student discount - Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. Hulu student discount - subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Max student discount - subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Sling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you&#39;ll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you&#39;ll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange &amp; Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+ and Hulu Duo Premium for $20/month : This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 47 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

    "description": "Gaming journalism stalwart Game Informer has risen from the ashes. More than thirty years after its debut issue back in August 1991, the media outlet was officially shut down by parent company GameStop in August 2024. Since then, the rights to Game Informer were acquired by Gunzilla Games and, in an all-to-rare win for today&#39;s media world, the entire team that worked for Game Informer at the time of its closure will return to their jobs. Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller posted the details about how the outlet was saved from the brink and noted that Gunzilla Games will be a hands-off boss. &quot;The new owners insisted on the idea of Game Informer remaining an independent editorial outlet,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They felt just as strongly as our team did that the only path forward was with an editorial group that made 100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so, without any influence from them or anyone else.&quot; “We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry,&quot; Gunzilla CEO and Co-Founder Vlad Korolov said . The website and its back catalog of content have been republished online. Game Informer &#39;s staff have also published reviews of more than two dozen games that came out during the site&#39;s hiatus and belatedly compiled their requisite best games of 2024 list. The print magazine is also expected to resume activity, and Miller said more details will be forthcoming about subscription and membership options. Gunzilla Games, which counts Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp among its leadership, made a battle royale shooter called Off the Grid and also developed the GUNZ blockchain platform.

    "description": "As it turns out, including a reporter in your national security leader group chat about military strikes isn&#39;t the only way to compromise sensitive information on Signal. NPR reported on Tuesday that, days after the Trump administration&#39;s preposterous and dangerous national security fumble , the Pentagon issued a warning against using the messaging app due to a phishing vulnerability. &quot;A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger application,&quot; a department-wide email obtained by NPR reads. &quot;Russian professional hacking groups are employing [Signal&#39;s] &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations.&quot; The publication says the memo states that Russian hacking groups are &quot;targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.&quot; A Signal spokesperson told NPR that the memo wasn&#39;t about Signal&#39;s security but about phishing attacks on the platform. So, if you&#39;re using the app, be especially mindful of attempts to trick you into linking devices to your account. Or simply communicate through different channels. The Pentagon directive follows a scandal that, at least in previous eras, would have ended the careers of a long list of high-profile officials. (In this one… who knows?) The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that a group of Trump administration national security officials inadvertently included him in a Signal group chat discussing military strikes in Yemen. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images The conversation included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, among others. They — with Goldberg essentially CC&#39;d — discussed the timing, targets and weapons involved in bombing Houthi sites in Yemen. A 2023 Department of Defense memo prohibited using mobile apps for even &quot;controlled unclassified information.&quot; NPR notes that military planning is many degrees more sensitive than that. And that doesn&#39;t even cover accidentally including a journalist in the conversation. The entire Atlantic article is worth a read, but a few gems from the chat include Hegseth&#39;s writing, &quot;I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It&#39;s PATHETIC.&quot; And, &quot;Nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.&quot; Adding to the &quot;It would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so dangerous&quot; nature of the fiasco, Hegseth went on camera to deny the chat&#39;s authenticity after the White House confirmed it. Although the fallout is still taking shape, here&#39;s an early taste. Watch below as retired US Navy captain and current US Senator Mark Kelly grills Gabbard and Ratcliffe on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

    "description": "We hear Signal is in the news . As longtime fans of the app, and secure messaging more broadly, we feel like it&#39;s our duty at Engadget to ensure you know how to use the software properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download Signal Signal is available on Android and iOS , as well as nearly every desktop operating system, including Windows and macOS. You can download the app by clicking one of the links provided above, or typing in &quot;Signal Messenger&quot; in your device&#39;s app store. Once you&#39;ve installed the app, proceed to set up an account using your phone number or an alias.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: If you want to install Signal on a workplace phone or computer, be sure to obtain approval from your employer; some organizations, such as the US government, either actively discourage or downright disallow use of the app.&nbsp; Create a new group Wonderful, you&#39;ve downloaded Signal! Now, to create a group chat, follow these steps:&nbsp; Tap the compose icon at the top of the interface.&nbsp; Select New Group. Add participants by selecting their name from your contact list, or inputting their username or phone number.&nbsp; Give your group a name (and a profile picture if you want).&nbsp; If the contents are especially sensitive, you may wish to enable Disappearing Messages and select an expiration time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#39;re in the process of adding new participants to a group, be sure to verify you&#39;re adding the right people. &nbsp; Some useful tips I would also suggest making use of Signal&#39;s Permissions feature to limit who can invite people to your chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings.&nbsp; Scroll down and select Permissions. Under &quot;Add Members,&quot; tap Only Admins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways someone can join your group chat is through a group link or QR Code . For additional security, you can set it so that admins must approve group link invites before the invitee can join.&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Scroll down and select Group Link.&nbsp; Switch the toggle to on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you know exactly who you can trust, but the guy down the hall might not! If you tend to get mixed up on names easily, Signal allows you to assign nicknames to users. After all, no one wants a case of mistaken identity. Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to assign a nickname to.&nbsp; Type in a name. You can also add a note, say describing the person&#39;s profession, in case you need additional context.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicknames are only visible to you, so don&#39;t be embarrassed to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp; How to remove someone from your group chat Look, even the best of us can make mistakes. Thankfully, Signal makes it easy to remove someone from a conversation thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to remove.&nbsp; Tap Remove From Group.&nbsp; How to delete messages in a Signal group chat So you somehow got through all of the above steps, added someone you shouldn&#39;t have and sent information that a relative stranger likely shouldn&#39;t have seen. Lets be honest, you&#39;re an edge case. But there&#39;s still hope if you caught your mistakes early.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap and hold the message on mobile (or hover the message bubble on desktop), Select Delete. Select Delete for Everyone. Now there&#39;s less chance of, for instance, a record of your civil and perhaps even criminal mishaps being shared to a notable reporter in a form potentially open to legal discovery.&nbsp; Ultimately, no matter how secure the messaging platform, if what you need to talk about is very, very sensitive, it&#39;s probably best to just &quot; get everyone in a room together .&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-add-someone-to-a-signal-group-chat-201430756.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals: The best sales from Shark, iRobot, Dyson and others",

    "description": "Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is only in its second year and, so far, we’ve found it to focus less on tech deals and more on home, cleaning and fashion discounts. That perhaps makes sense considering its timing, spring is a time for renewal and a refresh after all. But luckily, tech and home cleaning neatly intersect in the category of robot vacuums. We’ve tested dozens of these handy automatic floor cleaners and put the results in our buying guides . Right now, a number of our picks and related models are on sale so we’ve rounded up the best deals on vacuums Amazon’s latest sale has to offer. The best Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac for $400 ($350 off) : In our testing, we’ve been consistently impressed with Shark vacuums — but they’re not cheap. This machine can mop in addition to vacuum and is nearly half price at 47 percent off. Shark Robot PowerDetect NeverTouch vac and mop combo for $500 ($400 off) : This is the non-pro model of our runner up pick for the best combo bot. It mops and vacuums, quickly making a map of your home on its first run. The app easily lets you program where your hard and carpeted surfaces are, as well as set schedules. The base empties the dry debris and dirty water, then refills it with new water. The difference between this model and the Pro version is that this one doesn’t clean the mop with each use, so you may need to manually perform that task more often — but the price difference may make up for that lack. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off) : This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX for $140 (44 percent off) : The “S” in the model name stands for “slim” and it was one of the more low-profile machines we tried. It’s a pick in our guide to budget robot vacuums and has a long battery life and good suction power for its price. The main drawback is the lack of Wi-Fi, so instead of programming it with your phone, you’ll use the included remote. The best cordless vacuum deals Tineco Pure ONE Station 5 for $349 ($110 off) : This vac earned an honorable mention in our tests. The self-emptying base is a big selling point. We also liked the auto-adjusting suction and single-button start feature. The fact that it doesn’t require proprietary bags helps keep down the long-term cost, too. &nbsp; Tineco Pure ONE S11 cordless vacuum for $205 ($95 off with coupon) : Click the coupon to get $95 off our top pick for a budget stick vac. We like that it automatically adjusts suction depending on what it&#39;s picking up and is relatively lightweight when you’re pushing it around your floors. The bin is on the small side and the battery life isn’t as good as on other models, but it’s an easy-to-use, no-frills way to clean floors. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off) : This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Tineco Pure ONE Station FurFree for $400 ($300 off) : Of all the stick vacs our reviewer tried for our guide , this is the one she wanted to use the most. It’s super convenient with a dock that charges and empties and cleans all parts of the machine — brush, tube and dustbin — after each use. Plus the suction power is great and the iLoop smart sensor kicks up the suction when needed.

    "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed again. Publisher Paradox Interactive announced today that it is now targeting release in October 2025 instead of the first half of this year. &quot;Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date,&quot; the company said. Creating the sequel has been a trial of endurance that would test even an immortal undead&#39;s patience. Paradox parted ways with the game&#39;s original developer, Hardsuit Labs, in 2021. The Chinese Room, which made notable indie games Dear Esther and Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture , joined the project as developer in 2023. Today&#39;s update from offered some encouragement that the project is now in &quot;a late development stage,&quot; however it has decided to discontinue dev diaries that offered behind-the-scenes peeks at progress. The original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines game came out in 2004 after its own challenging development. Made by the now-shuttered Troika Studios, it was an story-driven game inspired by a tabletop RPG about several vampire clans in a modern-day Los Angeles. It was a commercial flop, but acquired a loyal audience over the years and even cultivated a community for mods and fan games .

    "description": "If you live in a rural area of the UK, you may soon be able to use your phone for satellite calls, messages and other standard data use. On Tuesday, the nation&#39;s telecom regulator, Ofcom, proposed using direct-to-device satellite tech to connect people in the UK&#39;s &quot;most rural and hard-to-reach places,&quot; like mountains and remote villages. Ofcom sees the tech complementing traditional networks, aiming to provide 100 percent mobile coverage in the UK. The regulator said the tech could also provide backup coverage during outages, offer service to ships and passengers in coastal waters without a connection and provide emergency 999 services (the UK&#39;s version of 911) in remote areas. In January, British telecom Vodafone made the world&#39;s first satellite video call using a standard mobile phone on a remote mountain in west Wales. Regarding the regulatory details, Ofcom suggests amending existing mobile spectrum licenses for frequencies already used by cellular providers (below 3 GHz). However, the regulator also offered alternative approaches, including introducing a new license for satellite services or allowing license-exempt use if certain conditions are met. Regardless of its specific policy approach, Ofcom said strict conditions would be attached to avoid interference with existing spectrum users in the UK and overseas. Ofcom is opening a consultation period with stakeholders from now to May 20. Depending on the feedback it receives, it could begin authorizing direct-to-device calls later this year.&nbsp; The iPhone 14 series was the first standard handset to offer direct-to-satellite emergency messaging . In iOS 18, Apple expanded the functionality beyond crises to any situation where you&#39;re off the grid . The Samsung Galaxy S25 series and Google Pixel 9 recently added similar functionality .

    "description": "Sunderfolk , a game that borrows elements from tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and couch party games like Jackbox, has a launch date. The fantasy RPG from Dreamhaven (the stomping ground of Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime ) arrives on April 23. You can play a demo today through April 7. While virtual tabletops like Wizards of the Coast&#39;s Sigil act as video game-like extensions of a traditional tabletop experience, Sunderfolk &#39;s premise is in using modern technology to simulate something like D&amp;D — but with more accessibility to casual players. Here, your phone becomes the deck of cards (and controller), while your TV or monitor is the game board. Although it supports remote play, this one sounds tailor-made for couch co-op. The game&#39;s story retreads familiar fantasy tropes, like a town of peaceful inhabitants invaded by dark and creepy monsters. Here, the heroes are a clan of anthropomorphic animals who each fit a familiar class like arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger or rogue. You can customize each with weapons, armor, items and skills as they level up. (When in doubt, play the classics!) Dreamhaven &quot;We were, with Sunderfolk, really trying to create something that would inspire people to get together in person,&quot; Game Director Erin Marek said in a preview trailer. &quot;We wanted it to feel similar to a game night, getting together to play a board game or getting together to play D&amp;D with a group of friends or family or loved ones that you really care about. And to share that experience together side-by-side.&quot; You can gather your cohorts to try the game for free on GeForce Now from now to April 7. The preview gives you access to all playable characters and an early part of the game. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need a paid GeForce membership ; a free account will do. Sunderfolk will cost $50 and be playable Steam , PS5 , Xbox Series X and Switch. But only the party member running the big-screen device needs to own the game; the phone app (iOS and Android) for your pals will be a free download when the game launches on April 23.

    "description": "Google has the pedal to the metal on its AI development. Just a few months after the debut of Gemini 2.0 , the tech giant has unveiled another upgrade in Gemini 2.5 . As with any new AI launch, Google is touting a strong performance on LMArena for Gemini 2.5, particularly its capabilities in coding, mathematics and science. The first model in this series is Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Google said this is a thinking model that&#39;s intended to provide responses grounded in more reasoning, analysis and context than the answers offered by classification- and prediction-driven models. It&#39;s a different approach than Google took with the Gemini 2.0 series, which started off with the more efficient and less expensive Flash version. &quot;With Gemini 2.5, we&#39;ve achieved a new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training,&quot; the company said in a blog post attributed to Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO of Google DeepMind. &quot;Going forward, we’re building these thinking capabilities directly into all of our models, so they can handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.&quot; Google had only just started rolling out Gemini 2.0 to its services, using it to power the newly added AI Mode in search and Deep Research for handling more complex queries. With today&#39;s launch, expect to hear more updates from the company about getting this latest version. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is available now in Google AI Studio, and Gemini Advanced members can use it directly in the Gemini app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-releases-gemini-25-ai-model-for-complex-thinking-182352224.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI just announced that all users will soon be able to generate images directly inside of ChatGPT. It’s rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team and, most importantly, Free users. This will be the default image generation tool in 4o, so there will be no need to open Dall-E whenever you want to whip up a picture of a cat in space eating lasagna or whatever. The feature’s also coming to Sora. The company says that the platform will &quot;generate high-quality images based on your prompt, conversation and uploaded files.&quot; To the latter point, it’ll be able to transform pre-existing images based on prompts. OpenAI is also boasting about significant improvements in text rendering and contextual understanding. These new tools are intended for both personal and professional use. As such, OpenAI gives a number of examples as to where this type of image generation could come in handy. These include the creation of infographics, social media promotional graphics and images with plenty of text, as seen below.&nbsp; OpenAI This being a modern generation tool, it can also handle high-end visuals. The company says it offers a &quot;strong capability for photorealism, including light, shadow, and texture accuracy.&quot; The ability to understand context could also be useful, as OpenAI says this could be used to create a “poster of birds found in Central Park” or a &quot;visualization of an art history era discussed previously in the conversation.&quot; Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqN Text and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx — OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 13, 2024 It&#39;s built on GPT-4o, an AI model that was first released last year . The &quot;o&quot; stands for &quot;omni&quot;, which is a reference to the model’s multimodal capabilities. This is what allows many of the aforementioned features, like being able to iterate on uploaded files. Today’s news looks like another step on the long road toward the “one AI to rule them all” functionality that Sam Altman teased a few weeks back .

    "description": "Apple announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference will be on June 9-13. The company is usually consistent with its event timing, so Tim Cook will probably take the stage to start the keynote on June 9 at 10AM PT/1PM ET. We&#39;ve already heard that iOS 19 and macOS 16 will be sporting new looks , so expect a focus on the latest software changes. And there&#39;s no way we won&#39;t be getting more Apple Intelligence updates. It was a core part of the iOS 18.3 update that rolled out at the start of the year and Apple has had struggles with some of the AI-powered features, particularly its notification summaries . One thing we don&#39;t anticipate seeing is the long-awaited update to Siri that will offer more personalization, also courtesy of Apple Intelligence. That project hit a delay in March and, no matter how hard we might hope otherwise , it seems unlikely the issues will all be resolved by June. Although the keynote is happening in-person at Apple Park, the rest of WWDC will take place online and is free for developers to attend.

    "description": "It&#39;s your lucky day if you&#39;re looking for good deals on Apple devices . Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , the Apple Watch Series 10 has dropped to its lowest price to date. The smartwatch is back on sale for a record-low price of $299. That&#39;s a $100 discount. The Apple Watch SE got a discount too. The device typically retails for $249, but you can snap it up for $169 . The Apple Watch Series 10 is our pick for the best smartwatch overall . That may not necessarily apply if you&#39;re an Android user, since you need an iPhone to actually use an Apple Watch. In any case, we gave the Apple Watch Series 10 a score of 90 in our review . Apple&#39;s current flagship smartwatch has a bigger screen, making it easier to see your notifications and health data (it&#39;s a pretty dang great device for wellness and fitness tracking). The thinner frame makes it more aesthetically pleasing too. On the downside, losing the blood oxygen feature from previous models is a bummer, but that issue was out of Apple&#39;s hands to a certain extent . It&#39;s perhaps not quite worth an upgrade if you have a Series 8 or 9 already. Apple isn&#39;t exactly reinventing the wheel here. Plus the sleep apnea detection feature that debuted alongside the Series 10 is also available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Still, if you&#39;re an Apple Watch newcomer or upgrading from an even older model, the Series 10 is likely your best option, especially for the sake of future proofing.

    "description": "Waymo is continuing to expand its foothold across the US, having recently started offering paid robotaxi services in more parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. Next up are Atlanta and Miami , and now the company has revealed plans to offer its driverless Waymo One service in the nation&#39;s capital in 2026. Before that can happen, though, Waymo will need to get approval from regulators. The company says it will &quot;continue to work closely with policymakers to formalize the regulations needed to operate without a human behind the wheel in the District.&quot; DC currently requires autonomous vehicles to have a human at the wheel, ready to take control if necessary. “Our priority remains ensuring that any company operating in the District — such as Waymo — does so in a manner that prioritizes safety, aligns with our regulatory framework, and integrates seamlessly into DC’s unique transportation ecosystem,” German Vigil, a spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, told The Washington Post . He noted that the agency is refining its approach to regulation &quot;based on public input, emerging best practices and lessons learned” from other jurisdictions. Waymo has tested its vehicles in DC for several years and it plans to &quot;continue introducing ourselves to DC’s communities and emergency responders over the coming months.&quot; Per the Post , if and when Waymo One does become available in the District, the robotaxis would not take riders to any of the region&#39;s airports, as they wouldn&#39;t (at least at the outset) have a permit to cross into Maryland or Virginia.

    "description": "Instagram is adding another tool to its arsenal of anti-bullying measures. This time, however, Meta is enlisting school officials directly in an effort to speed up its response to safety issues affecting young teens. The company is introducing a new “Schools Partnership Program” that aims to give teachers and school administrators a way to intervene when students experience bullying on Instagram. The program offers schools something that many parents have long said they wanted: a way to fast-track in-app reports that directly affect young students. Meta is promising that schools who join the program will have their reports “prioritized” in its moderation queue, and that it will respond to these reports within 48 hours. Schools that sign up will also get a “school partner” badge appended to their Instagram account, along with in-app information about how to use its reporting tools and other resources. Notably though, it doesn’t sound like Meta is hiring additional content moderators to aid with these new fast-tracked reports. When asked about increasing headcount to support the program, an Instagram spokesperson told Engadget only that reports from schools will be “expedited” via its existing reporting channels, and that schools will be able to add &quot;additional context&quot; to their reports. Meta says it’s already tested the program with 60 schools and that early results have been “promising.” Now, middle schools and high schools in the United States can sign up to join a waitlist for the program. The pilot program is far from the first time Instagram has tried to address bullying. The app introduced comment limiting features in 2021 , and added a tougher &quot; restrict &quot; feature last year. But while these features can help teens avoid certain types of negative interactions, they still required teens (or their parents) to tweak their settings. By now giving schools more authority to report specific instances of bullying or other bad behavior, Meta is offering some hope that it will be easier for schools to address the underlying behavior.

    "description": "When Sony&#39;s wireless earbuds come to mind, the flagship-quality WF-1000XM5 is probably the first product that jumps out. However, the company is also adept at building budget models, blending features and tech to give users a solid value for a lot less money. That was the proposition when the WF-C700N arrived in 2023 , offering active noise cancellation (ANC), solid battery life and other features for $120. Now, Sony is back with the successor to those earbuds, the WF-C710N , that packs a host of improvements but keeps the price the same.&nbsp; First, Sony says it improved ANC performance by employing dual mics on each earbud on the C710N. The C700N only had one on each side. The company is also using AI Noise Reduction this time around to improve call quality. On the outside, Sony replaced the physical button for the onboard controls with a touch panel, and the company added wear detection for added convenience.&nbsp; You can also expect longer battery life on the C710N. At 8.5 hours with ANC enabled, that&#39;s an hour longer than the C700N. With ANC off, you can expect up to two hours more than the previous model. Additionally, total battery life including the case is doubled, with up to 30 hours of noise-canceling use available (up to 40 hours with ANC off). Sony improved the quick charge feature as well, giving you an hour of play time in five minutes instead of the previous 10-minute window. The WF-C710N is available for preorder today in black, white, pink and a transparent Glass Blue for $120. I guess Sony&#39;s confusing product names aren&#39;t entirely going away after all.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-overhauls-its-budget-earbuds-while-keeping-the-price-the-same-010025194.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Discord has begun rolling out a redesigned desktop app that adds more customization to the client. To start, the new app increases the number of free themes to four. Where previously you could choose between two skins — light and dark — if you weren&#39;t a Nitro subscriber, now your options are light, ash, dark and onyx. In short, everyone gets access to more dark themes. Discord has also added three new UI density options — default, spacious and compact. These are separate from the app&#39;s existing message layout options, so it&#39;s another way to tweak the look and feel of the interface. With this redesign, the company is also finally giving users the option to resize the channel list. Discord has also redesigned the controls that appear when you&#39;re on a voice or video call. Now, more of the buttons you may want to press during a call will appear in the center bar along the bottom of the screen. At the same time, the mic and camera buttons feature more color, so you have a better indicator if you&#39;re muted or your camera is active. &quot;All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,&quot; Discord explains. Discord Separately, the redesigned app ships with a new overlay that Discord says is faster and won&#39;t impact game performance. Taking a page Valve&#39;s recent redesign of Steam , Discord has reworked the interface around widgets, meaning you can move around each individual element as you wish. The company has also re-engineered the overlay so that it doesn&#39;t &quot;hook&quot; itself into games. As a result, it&#39;s less likely to trigger anti-cheat systems like BattleEye . In turn, that means the new overlay is compatible with &quot;a larger portion of the most-played games on Discord.&quot; It&#39;s even possible to watch a friend&#39;s stream directly from the new overlay. The redesigned app and overlay arrive after Discord CEO Jason Citron announced last May the company would refocus on building the best possible communications tool for gamers. In 2020, Discord briefly rebranded itself as a general purpose chat app after many young people turned to the platform to stay in touch with their friends during lockdown. &quot;After taking stock of the world now that the pandemic is largely behind us, and learning directly from you about how Discord can be even more useful, we&#39;ve recognized the need to narrow our focus from broadly being a community-centric chat app to being a place that helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests,&quot; Citron wrote last year. The update also arrives at what could be a pivotal moment for Discord. According to a recent New York Times report , the company could go public as early as later this year. With 72 percent of Discord users regularly gaming on PC, ensuring those people are taken care of ahead of a potential IPO takes on a sense of urgency.

    "description": "It&#39;s no secret that Dyson devices are pricey, but you can find good sales on them if you&#39;re patient and know where to look. Case in point, the Amazon Spring Sale : not only are a few Dyson cordless vacuums included amongst the discounts, but this Dyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus heater and fan is as well. You can snag it for $300, or $170 off its usual price. As its name suggests, the Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus can heat your room in the winter and cool it off in the summer. Its fan mode includes Air Multiplier tech, which creates a smooth and uninterrupted airstream thanks to its lack of traditional fan blades. When you need some warmth, its ceramic plates heat up quickly. The appliance has two modes: focused and diffused. Focused mode warms or cools one person, while diffused mode heats your entire room or provides a gentle breeze during the summer. It oscillates at a 70-degree angle. Dyson&#39;s fan has a sleep timer with a shutoff range between 15 minutes and nine hours, and you can store its curved and magnetized remote control inside the appliance to help prevent it from being lost. The lowest we&#39;ve ever seen this product&#39;s price drop is $280, so being able to snag it for $300 in the middle of March, when we&#39;re nowhere near Black Friday or Prime Day, is about as good a deal as you can hope for. If you&#39;re on the market for other Dyson gear , a few more devices are included in the Amazon Spring Sale, including the Dyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum on discount for $330.

    "description": "Apple plans to start using images it collects for Maps to train its AI models. In a disclosure spotted by 9to5Mac , the company said starting this month it would use images it captures to provide its Look Around feature for the additional purpose of training some of its generative AI models. Look Around is Apple&#39;s answer to Google Street View. The company originally released the feature alongside its 2019 revamp of Apple Maps . The tool allows users to see locations from ground level. Apple blurs faces and license plates photographed in Look Around images to protect the privacy of any individuals caught in its survey efforts. &quot;In addition to improving Apple Maps and the algorithms that blur faces and license plates in images published in Look Around feature, Apple also will use blurred imagery collected during surveys conducted beginning in March 2025 to develop and improve other Apple products and services,&quot; the company writes in the disclosure. &quot;This includes using data to train models powering Apple products and services, including models related to image recognition, creation, and enhancement.&quot; Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget&#39;s request for more information. The company&#39;s Apple Maps image collection policy page provides a list of regions and dates when it plans to collect new images for Look Around. People can find when Apple&#39;s survey crews and vehicles plan to visit their area by sorting by country and then clicking on a specific region. Apple currently offers a few different features that rely on image generation models. Image Playground, for instance, allows owners of Apple Intelligence -compatible devices to write a prompt to create a new image. There&#39;s also Clean Up in Photos, which you can use to remove objects from your favorite snapshots. Google has been using Street View images to train AI models for years. In 2017, for example, a pair of researchers from the company trained a machine learning model to generate professional-looking photographs from a dataset collected from Street View.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-will-use-its-street-view-maps-photos-to-train-ai-models-150919972.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple may avoid a fine in one of the European Union investigations it&#39;s currently the subject of. The bloc&#39;s executive arm, the European Commission, will next week end a probe into whether Apple hindered iPhone users from easily changing their browser or search engine, according to Reuters . Apple is said to have complied with rules laid out under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to make it a cinch for users to switch to alternative browsers, social media platforms and other online services while giving smaller rivals a better chance to compete. Violations of the DMA, legislation that broadly seeks to keep the power of Big Tech in check, can lead to a fine of up to 10 percent of a company&#39;s total annual revenue, and up to 20 percent for repeat offenses. However, Apple may not be entirely off the hook. Per the report, the EU is set to dish out fines to both that company and Meta. The second Apple case concerns whether the company inhibited app developers from freely informing users about alternate payment options that are available away from the App Store ecosystem. As for Meta, it was reported this week that the EU may fine the company north of $1 billion for violating DMA rules as a result of its &quot;consent or pay&quot; ad-free subscription option in the region.

    "description": "Now that the Amazon Spring Sale is here, we&#39;re on the lookout for the best tech deals to grab from it. In typical Amazon fashion, Blink security cameras have been discounted for the shopping event. The Blink Mini 2 is available for $20 , which is half off its regular price and the best discount we&#39;ve seen. You can pick up two of the wired security cameras for $38, which represents a 46 percent discount. We reckon the Blink Mini 2 is the best budget security camera around. You can adjust the webcam-style camera to a variety of angles. It&#39;s weather-resistant, so you can place it outside if you have a special power adapter. The camera picks up decent (but not great) images, particularly those captured in the infrared nighttime view. It also has a built-in LED spotlight. Since Blink is an Amazon company, of course the Mini 2 ties into the Alexa ecosystem. You&#39;ll just need to have a Blink account before you can actually use it. As you might expect, you&#39;ll be able to view images captured by the Mini 2 via the Alexa app on an Echo Show, Fire Tablet or Fire TV but, curiously, not iOS or Android. To see the captures on your phone or tablet, you&#39;ll instead need to use the Blink app. You&#39;ll get some extra features — such as cloud storage and people and pet detection — if you sign up for the Blink Subscription ($3 per month for one camera, $10 per month for any number). Elsewhere in the sale, a five-pack of the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras is half off at $200 . This is our recommendation for the best security camera for Alexa users . Having five of them should be enough for many folks to keep an eye on everything that&#39;s going on around their property.

    "description": "Starting today, DJs will have access to Apple Music&#39;s catalog of over 100 million songs through more hardware and software platforms. DJs of all skill levels can build and mix sets on AlphaTheta, Serato, Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark and RANE DJ. This news follows the initial debut of Apple Music integration with Algoriddim&#39;s djay Pro software last year. There&#39;s also a new name for the whole initiative: DJ with Apple Music . And yes, a subscription is required. This isn&#39;t to be confused with Apple Music&#39;s DJ Mixes, a separate program that began in 2021 . The idea there was to attract creators of said DJ mixes and sets to the platform by leveraging Shazam&#39;s technology (owned by Apple) to ensure proper royalties were paid out. Now, Apple says, it&#39;s giving DJs access to its music catalog so it can be used as a creative tool and so they can easily tap into their personal libraries. There&#39;s a new DJ with Apple Music category page in the streaming app with curated playlists, and each platform has its own curator page complete with practice material. Spotify used to allow integration with third-party DJ apps, but the service stopped doing so in 2020 . If you&#39;re looking for options, djay Pro works with Tidal and SoundCloud, in addition to Apple Music.

    "description": "Anker&#39;s Eufy 3-in-1 E20 robot vacuum is $150 off right now , as part of Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. That brings the price down to $400, which is a record low. For those averse to using Amazon, the deal is also available directly from the company . The E20 made our list of the best robot vacuums , and with good reason. We loved the hybrid functionality, as this robovac quickly transforms into a cordless stick vacuum and a handheld unit. This in no way impedes the overall performance, as we found the automatic cleaning mode to be top-tier. The self-emptying base also holds a lot, considering its compact size. We praised the proprietary app in our official review , as editing room maps is both quick and easy. All told, it only took the robovac ten minutes to scoot around the house and create an accurate map.&nbsp; The suction power of the robotic unit is strong enough for major cleaning tasks, but the same cannot be said of the stick vacuum attachment. The power is on the weaker side. Also, it doesn’t come with a wall mount for the stick vacuum. That costs extra, to the tune of around $30. Today’s savings more than makes up for that.

    "description": "If you can&#39;t open a window for whatever reason, an air purifier can help make the air in your home a bit more comfortable. One of our favorites, the Levoit Core 400S air purifier , is on sale for $187 thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale . While that&#39;s not a record low — we&#39;ve seen it as low as $177 last year — it&#39;s still a good discount on one of the most convenient air purifiers for large spaces. This deal is part of a larger Levoit sale during the Spring Sale that includes other air purifiers, humidifiers and more. We’ve featured Levoit in our list of the best air purifiers for its strong performance and smart features. The Core 400S can cover rooms up to 1,980 square feet using a three-stage filtration system to capture allergens, dust, pet dander and smoke. It also includes a smart sensor that adjusts fan speed based on air quality, so you’re not running it at full blast when you don’t need to. One of the Levoit Core 400S’ biggest selling points is its low noise output, which makes it a good fit for bedrooms or home offices. If you need to knuckle down and get some work done without distraction whilst keeping your room’s air clean and fresh, even at higher speeds, it stays relatively quiet compared to bulkier purifiers. It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands. Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness. If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.

    "description": "If you’re looking for a budget-friendly robot vacuum that can handle both vacuuming and mopping, iRobot’s Roomba Combo Essential just hit its lowest price ever. Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , it’s down to $149 from $275, matching the lowest price we’ve seen. It previously dipped to $149 during the holiday season and earlier this year, but it’s unclear how long this deal will stick around this time. As you can see in our roundup of the best budget robot vacuums , we’ve consistently rated iRobot’s machines highly for their reliability and ease of use. The Roomba Combo Essential is a simple, no-frills option that both vacuums and mops, making it a solid pick for small apartments, dorm rooms or anyone who wants a cleaner floor without spending a fortune. The vacuum uses special multi-surface brushes to pick up dirt, dust and pet hair from hard floors and carpets. Unlike some budget models that struggle with transitions, this one automatically adjusts to different surfaces, so you won’t have to worry about it getting stuck. When it’s time to mop, the built-in mopping pad wipes down hard floors, tackling light spills and everyday messes. It’s not as advanced as iRobot’s higher-end models with precision scrubbing, but it’s a convenient way to keep your floors looking fresh with minimal effort. One of iRobot Roomba Combo Essential&#39;s most convenient features is its auto-adjusting cleaning power — the robot increases suction when it detects extra debris, so it’s more effective on high-traffic areas like entryways or around pet bowls. It also has cliff sensors to prevent it from tumbling down stairs and a low-profile design that helps it slip under some couches and other furniture for a more thorough clean. Despite it being an entry-level robot vacuum, the iRobot Roomba Combo Essential comes with app control and voice assistant support, so you can set cleaning schedules and initiate cleaning whether you’re at home lounging on the couch or away on vacation. For $150, this is a solid deal for an iRobot machine that can vacuum and mop, especially considering its usual $275 price tag. If you’ve been thinking about automating some of your floor cleaning, this is one of the most affordable ways to do it.

    "description": "If you’re a content creator or YouTuber, Sony, Canon and other camera companies want your business. There are more vlogging-specific models than ever, with several new models having arrived since our last guide, including Fujifilm’s XM-5. Recent vlogging-specific models include Sony’s new ZV-E1 full-frame mirrorless that launched last year, DJI’s Osmo Pocket 3 and Canon’s compact PowerShot V10. Others in this guide, like the new Panasonic G9 II and Canon’s EOS R6 II are hybrid mirrorless cameras that offer vlogging as part of a larger toolset. Many have certain things in common, like flip-around screens, face- and/or eye-detect autofocus and stabilization. Prices, features and quality can vary widely, though. To that end, we’ve updated our guide with all the latest vlogging cameras designed for novice to professional creators, in all price ranges. Engadget has tested all of these to give you the best possible recommendations. Table of contents Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Upcoming cameras What to look for in a vlogging camera Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Best action and portable cameras If you’re just starting out in vlogging or need a small, rugged camera, an action cam might be your best bet. In general, they’re easy to use as you don’t have to worry about things like exposure or focus. Recent models also offer good electronic stabilization and sharp, colorful video at up to 4K and 60 fps. The downsides are a lack of control; image quality that’s not on par with larger cameras; and no zooming or option to change lenses. The best compact vlogging cameras Compact cameras are a step-up option from smartphones or action cameras, with larger sensors and much better image quality. At the same time, they’re not quite as versatile as mirrorless or DSLR cameras (and not necessarily cheaper) and they lack advanced options like 10-bit video. For folks who want the best possible quality without needing to think too much about their camera, however, it’s the best option. The best mirrorless vlogging cameras This is the class that has changed the most over the past couple of years, particularly in the more affordable price categories. Interchangeable lens cameras give you the most options for vlogging, offering larger sensors than compact cameras with better low-light sensitivity and shallower depth of field to isolate you or your subject. They also offer better control of your image with manual controls, log recording, 10-bit video and more. The drawbacks are extra weight compared to action or compact cameras, extra complexity and higher prices. Upcoming cameras If you’re not quite ready to buy, there are some interesting options on the horizon. Canon just teased a camera which could be the R50 V, likely to be a vlogging-focused update to the R50 I recommended. Canon may also announce the availability of the PowerShot V1, a compact camera with a Type 1.4 sensor that’s larger than the 1-inch sensors found on most compact cameras. Meanwhile, Panasonic just announced the S1R II, a 45-megapixel hybrid camera. Though the high resolution would suggest it’s mainly for photography, the S1R II can shoot 8K video at up to 30 fps and capture 5.7K 30 RAW internally. It’s fairly expensive, but considerably cheaper than other options including the Nikon Z8 and Canon EOS R5 II. That model is now on pre-order and set to start shipping by the end of March — stay tuned for Engadget’s review. What to look for in a vlogging camera Vlogging cameras are designed for filmmakers who often work alone and either use a tripod, gimbal, vehicle mount or just their hands to hold a camera. It has to be good not just for filming yourself, but other “B-roll” footage that helps tell your story. The number one requirement is a flip-around screen so you can see yourself while filming. Those can rotate up, down or to the side, but flipping out to the side is preferable so a tripod or microphone won’t block it. Continuous autofocus (AF) for video with face and eye detection is also a must. It becomes your camera “assistant,” keeping things in focus while you concentrate on your content. Most cameras can do that nowadays, but some still do it better than others. If you move around or walk a lot, you should look for a camera with built-in optical stabilization. Electronic stabilization is another option as long as you’re aware of the limitations. You’ll also need a camera with a fast sensor that limits rolling shutter, which can create a distracting jello “wobble” with quick camera movements. Steve Dent/Engadget 4K recording is another key feature. All cameras nowadays can shoot 4K up to at least 24 fps, but if possible, it’s better to have 4K at 60 or even 120 fps. If you shoot sports or other things involving fast movement, look for a model with at least 1080p at 120 fps for slow-motion recording. Video quality and color accuracy are other important considerations, especially for skin tones. Good light sensitivity helps for night shooting or concerts, and a log profile helps improve dynamic range in very bright or dark shooting conditions. If you want the best possible image quality and can afford it, get a camera that can record 4K with 10-bits (billions) of colors. That will give you more options when you go to edit. Don’t neglect audio either; if the quality is bad, your audience will disengage. Look for a camera with a microphone port so you can plug in a shotgun or lapel mic for interviews, or at least one with a good-quality built-in microphone. It’s also nice to have a headphone port to monitor sound so you can avoid nasty surprises after you’ve finished shooting. You’ll also want good battery life and, if possible, dual memory card slots for a backup. Finally, don’t forget about your camera’s size and weight. If you’re constantly carrying one while shooting, especially at the end of a gimbal or gorillapod, it might actually be the most important factor. That’s why tiny GoPro cameras are so popular for sports, despite offering lower image quality and fewer pro features.

    "description": "One of Samsung&#39;s CEOs, Jong-hee Han, has died due to a heart attack, according to Reuters and CNBC . He was 63. Han joined the company in 1988 and became the head of product research and development for visual display in 2011. He then led Samsung&#39;s TV business before he was named as the head of Samsung DX, which is what the company calls its merged mobile and consumer electronics divisions, in 2021. In 2022, he officially became the company&#39;s Vice Chairman and CEO. Han had no experience in mobile before he started leading the company&#39;s DX group, but Samsung gave him credit for helping it get to the top of global TV sales for 15 years.&nbsp; CNBC says Han was one of the executives who hosted Samsung&#39;s annual general shareholders meeting just a week ago and answered questions about the company&#39;s poor stock performance. During the meeting, Han apologized to the shareholders, telling them that Samsung &quot;failed to adequately respond to the rapidly evolving AI semiconductor market.&quot; He also told the shareholders that Samsung was having difficulties when it came to semiconductor-related mergers and acquisitions due to regulatory issues, but that the company was &quot;determined to produce some tangible results this year.&quot; Based on the notice Samsung published , Han&#39;s co-CEO Young-Hyun Jun is now the sole CEO of the company. Jun, who also heads Samsung&#39;s semiconductor business, was appointed as Han&#39;s co-CEO in November 2024. It&#39;s not clear whether Samsung is planning to appoint another CEO in the future.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-ceo-jong-hee-han-has-died-120029286.html?src=rss",

According to a report in <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/not-so-permadeath-blizzard-revives-hardcore-wow-characters-killed-by-ddos-attacks/\">Ars Technica</a></em>, Blizzard made the pronouncement in response to a string of DDoS attacks that seemed specifically targeted to cause the in-game deaths of members of a high-profile raiding guild.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hardcode mode was introduced with <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>. It’s a super intense, extremely difficult style of play where a character’s death is permanent no matter how it comes — whether it be falling in a mythic difficulty dungeon, getting ganked in PvP, or simply getting overrun by level 1 boars — is permanent. In regular <em>WoW</em>, characters can come back from or cheat death with a variety of mechanics which are disabled in Hardcore. The game mode has other adjustments, like requiring players to manually set their PvP flag, that Blizzard made to make the mode slightly less punishing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until now, there were no exceptions to the policy even in situations outside of a player’s control such as a death suffered during disconnection from the game server. And it seems like malicious actors were exploiting that strict policy to cause the deaths of members of a popular streaming guild OnlyFangs. According to <em>Ars Technica</em>, DDoS attacks seemed to coincide with the guild’s raiding attempts causing the permadeath of several members. The attacks were so frequent that soadapoppin, a popular Twitch streamer and OnlyFangs’ member, suggested that the guild might need to shutter operations indefinitely unless some kind of protections were put in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blizzard addressed the issue on the <em>World of Warcraft</em> forums saying that it is aware of the targeted nature of the DDoS attacks and are taking steps to rollback some player deaths</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’re taking steps to resurrect player-characters that were lost as a result of these attacks,” wrote <em>WoW Classic</em> associate production director Clay Stone. “In the future, Blizzard may elect —&nbsp;at our sole discretion&nbsp;— to revive Hardcore characters that perish in a mass event which we deem inconsistent with the integrity of the game, such as a DDoS attack.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

That turn-based nature means the menus are integral to the experience. You don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t skip past them to get to the action; they <em>are</em> the action.

It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s called <a href=\"https://www.geekbench.com/\">Geekbench</a>, and it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a cross-platform tool that simulates a bunch of real-world activities to give each device a score that roughly approximates how powerful it is. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not perfect (no benchmark is), but it can be revealing. In this case, it shows off an iPad that is very good at the things iPads <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\">have always been good at</a>, but it may be about to hit its limit &acirc;&#128;&#148; and definitely isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t ready for what&acirc;&#128;&#153;s to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When you run a Geekbench CPU test on a device like the iPad, it tests both single-core and multicore performance. Most modern devices have multiple cores: the iPad&acirc;&#128;&#153;s A16 chip has five CPU cores and four GPU cores; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review\">the current iPad Pro</a> has nine and 10, respectively; and you can spec the latest Mac Studio all the way up to 28 CPU cores and 60 GPU cores. Not all cores are created the same, and we could talk about this forever, but let&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All you need to know is that a single-core process only does one thing at a time and is typically used for simple everyday computing tasks, like running your email app or refreshing your Spotify homepag &amp;hellip;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review\">Read the full story at The Verge.</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The Leaf will return as a crossover SUV with a Tesla plug (!!), casting off its outdated appearance that previously led to rumors of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/4/23290517/nissan-leaf-ev-discontinued-electric-car-legacy\">its inevitable demise</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nissan is also rebooting some other familiar nameplates, including the Sentra and Rogue. But the newly refreshed, third-generation Leaf is coming first, arriving in North America in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It makes sense that Nissan would throw out its old looks for something new and daring. The automaker is going through a particularly rough patch at the moment, with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-02-27/nissan-sales-decline-failed-honda-merger-put-carmaker-in-crisis\">declining sales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/611974/honda-nissan-cancel-merger\">the collapse of a merger deal</a> with Honda. It needs some fresh products to help boost its overall image. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/US-Nissan-Range-Teaser.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Nissan is teasing several new products. \" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s hard to tell from the photos, but <em><a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/754619/2026-nissan-leaf/\">InsideEVs</a></em> (which attended the reveal event in Japan) describes the new Leaf as egg-shaped (which is typical for most modern EVs) and about 3/4ths the size of a Tesla Model Y. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nissan didn’t reveal much about the new Leaf, aside from confirming that it will be built on the modular CMF-EV platform that also undergirds the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/20/23648673/nissan-ariya-first-drive-photos-price-specs\">Ariya EV</a>. The new Leaf will also have “significant range improvements over the previous generation.” The current Leaf sits in the low category for range, with the SV Plus trim getting a maximum 212 miles on single charge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perched on 19-inch alloy wheels, the new Leaf features a panoramic moonroof and — perhaps most shockingly — a native North American Charging Standard (NACS) charging port for Tesla Supercharger access. Nissan says it will be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23800436/nissan-tesla-nacs-support-supercharging-adapter\">the first EV in its vehicle lineup</a> to roll out of the factory with an integrated NACS port. As one of the first commercially available electric vehicles, the Leaf has always been saddled with outdated charging tech in the form of the CHAdeMO port. But now Nissan is rectifying that issue for this new generation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Leaf appeared to be headed for the compost heap up until recently, with <em>Automotive News</em> reporting in 2022 that Nissan would be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23219044/nissan-leaf-phase-out-discontinue-ev-pioneer\">winding down production</a> on the current generation by mid-decade, with no immediate plans for a refresh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nissan is promising more details on the new Leaf by mid-year. The company also announced that new ICE and plug-in hybrid versions of its Rogue SUV, and refreshed models of its mid-sized Pathfinder SUV and Sentra sedan, would be coming soon. For Infiniti, a refreshed three-row luxury QX60 SUV is on its way, alongside a new Sport package for the full-size QX80 SUV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/US-INFINITI-Range-Teaser.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4752184837776,100,93.049563032445\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Infiniti also plans on releasing several new models.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then in late fiscal year 2027, Nissan will introduce a new, unnamed EV slated for production as its Canton, Mississippi plant. The automaker says it will be an “adventure themed” SUV, so expect something of the Rivian/Scout/Jeep variety. In fiscal year 2028, Infiniti will release a luxury SUV inspired by the Vision QXe concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The automaker had previously discussed its plans to electrify half its vehicle lineup, including seven EVs for the US and Canada. Today, Nissan clarified that these future models will feature batteries manufactured in the US in partnership with SK one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Europe, Nissan said its reviving the Micra — a small car the company stopped making in the UK in 2010 — later this year, reintroducing the model as a compact EV. An electric variant of the Juke compact SUV will be launched in fiscal 2026.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And that’s all I have to say about that.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/nycsouthpaw.bsky.social/post/3ll7k7psjyc2q\">claimed</a> that “No ‘war plans’ were discussed” (but also later emailed <em>The Atlantic</em> to say “we object to the release” of the texts). At the subsequent hearing, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5212727-warner-gabbard-ratcliffe-classified-details-signal/\">reiterated</a> the claim that “no classified material” was shared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a follow-up article on Wednesday, <em>The Atlantic</em> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/\">released the messages</a>. Having previously omitted but alluded to details about bombing targets in Yemen, <em>The Atlantic </em>reached out to several government agencies, since so many government officials, including President Donald Trump, have been repeatedly describing the chat content as nonclassified. Leavitt had replied, again, that the texts contained “no classified information.” <em>The Atlantic </em>proceeded to publish the unredacted messages, withholding the name of a CIA intelligence officer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to <em>The Atlantic, </em>Hegseth’s “not war plans” included:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (Mq-9s)”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“1536 F-19 2nd Strike Starts &#8211; also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are currently clean on OPSEC”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Godspeed to our Warriors.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, <em>The Atlantic </em>quotes Waltz’s text: “Typing too fast. The first target &#8211; their top missile guy &#8211; we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The Atlantic </em>adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vance responded a minute later: “Excellent.” Thirty-five minutes after that, Ratcliffe, the CIA director, wrote, “A good start,” which Waltz followed with a text containing a fist emoji, an American-flag emoji, and a fire emoji. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Signal incident is what happens when you have the most unqualified Secretary of Defense we&#039;ve ever seen.<br><br>We&#039;re lucky it didn&#039;t cost any servicemembers their lives, but for the safety of our military and our country, Secretary Hegseth needs to resign. <a href=\"https://t.co/IjwJmvwBY7\">https://t.co/IjwJmvwBY7</a></p>&mdash; Senator Mark Kelly (@SenMarkKelly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenMarkKelly/status/1904878146068902146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this week, Sen.

Ruben Gallego of Arizona <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/hegseth-national-security-group-chat-atlantic-reaction-00244983\">called</a> the debacle “amateur hour.” Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-goldberg-the-atlantic-trump-officials-group-chat-signal/\">said</a> if the incident did in fact occur it &#8220;represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.&#8221; Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Don Bacon from Nebraska called it “unconscionable,” and Republican Sen. John Cornyn from Texas said, “It sounds like a huge screw-up. &#8230; Is there any other way to describe it?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Tuesday, Trump told <em>NBC News</em> that the situation <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-signal-yemen-atlantic-group-chat-4b09973f4df3711d5d5ff88e8f9f96e0\">“turned out not to be a serious one”</a> and referred to it as a “glitch.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/discuss/t/important-update-about-google-assistant-in-waze-ios/380605\">an update on Tuesday</a>, Waze said it plans on replacing it with an “enhanced voice integration solution” in the future, which is most likely Gemini.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As many of you have likely experienced, this feature [Google Assistant] has not been working as intended for over a year, and we sincerely apologize for the prolonged inconvenience,” Waze said. “Rather than simply patching a feature that has faced ongoing difficulties, we’ve decided to phase out Google Assistant on iOS starting tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the past year, many <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/waze/comments/16m9jrd/google_assistant_not_listening_ios/\">Waze users</a> on iPhones <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/waze/comments/14kqb6y/voice_recognition_not_working_on_iphone/\">have reported</a> experiencing issues with giving Google Assistant voice commands. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/waze/thread/207371443/google-assistant-not-working-in-waze-iphone-ios-16-2?hl=en\">One user notes</a> that saying “Hey Google” would open Google Assistant, but it wouldn’t detect their voice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Google Assistant for Waze on Android phones will continue to work — but the question is for how long. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/629904/google-assistant-gemini-moving-on\">Google announced plans to transition</a> more users from Google Assistant to Gemini, adding that Assistant “will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices or available for new downloads on mobile app stores” starting “later this year.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Waze has already <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284037/waze-report-incidents-voice\">begun testing conversational reporting</a> with Gemini, allowing users to report incidents while speaking naturally.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

As she says, “On any given day, I can be evaluating anything from robot vacuums, smart locks, and lights, to smart chicken coops, smart ovens, and connected coffee makers.”</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Jennifer has been a journalist for her entire career, “starting at </em>The Daily Telegraph<em> in London, England, right out of university.”</em> <em>She’s been at </em>The Verge <em>since 2021; before that, she was a freelance journalist for publications including </em>Dwell, Wirecutter, Wired, <em>and </em>US News<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Besides installing and testing a constant influx of smart tech, Jennifer lives with her husband, two children, a dog, two cats, a rabbit, and a backyard full of chickens. We checked out her office setup and asked her how she keeps track of it all. Here’s what she told us.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>That looks like a comfortable, if somewhat crowded, space. Where in your home is it?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My office is upstairs in our two-story house in Charleston, South Carolina, in what used to be a guest room. For a while, I had my desk in our bedroom, which was not great, as my husband worked 24-hour shifts and sometimes liked to sleep during the day. So, we decided to convert this to my office / guest room (the couch is a sleeper sofa).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the time, I offered my two children the option to have this as their room, and I would take over one of theirs — both of their rooms have much bigger windows, which I coveted. But this is a bigger room with a bathroom! Surprisingly, they both declined, so I got all the space to myself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I really need it — I am on a first-name basis with my UPS, FedEx, and DHL delivery drivers,&nbsp;who are at my house multiple times a week delivering or retrieving packages. I test a <em>lot</em> of gear.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0037.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;A home office that’s crowded but comfortable.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Could you tell us a bit about your L-shaped desk?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The desk was custom-built by my very handy husband from upcycled scraps of African purpleheart and Brazilian bubinga wood he bought from a woodworker on Facebook Marketplace. It was originally designed to fit perfectly in the corner of our bedroom, but luckily, it also works really well in its new home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While I knew that having a big desk would attract more clutter, I have to face the fact that I’m a clutter lover. Also, I primarily use the long part of the L-shape for photographing, tinkering, and setting up a lot of the devices I test. It’s like my workbench. The drawers below it are full of surprisingly organized little trays with a variety of batteries, screws, screwdrivers, double-sided tape, SIM tools, and other hardware I need while testing gadgets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My husband also built a very useful “tech hub” into the desk: shelving under the desk on the right where I can tuck away things like my router (currently an Eero Pro 7) and the many smart home hubs, bridges, etc. I’m running. The wires all feed through strategically placed holes that funnel to a somewhat managed cable system under the desk — basically, a plastic crate that holds all my power strips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>And your chair?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s a leather La-Z-Boy. I picked it up at Staples while back-to-school shopping a couple of years ago. I used to have a very hard bright red office chair, which looked super cool but was not comfortable. This one is comfortable, if not particularly supportive; it’s very large and super plush — leaning back in it makes me feel like an executive or a supervillain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Tell us about the various tech devices you’re using. </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a lot!

It is annoying swapping between two computers, though, so generally, I only use the M80 when I need to keep an eye on multiple things at once, like during a big event.&nbsp; The monitor has streaming built in and is a smart home hub for Samsung SmartThings, so I also use it as a TV — it’s easy to see from the couch, and I’ll sometimes have tennis on in the background on mute while I’m working. I can’t listen to music while I write; it’s too distracting, but the tennis is soothing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All the little screens you see are smart displays. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23882652/amazon-echo-hub-smart-home-controller-hands-on\">the Echo Hub</a>, which gives me easy access to control connected devices in my office, such as lights, fans, and shades. Then an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23945192/amazon-echo-show-8-alexa-smart-display-review\">Echo Show 8</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review\">Pixel Tablet</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review\">Google Nest Hub</a>. They’re primarily for testing purposes, but they also make nice photo frames.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The keyboard is something I’m testing. I usually have a huge <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166?utm_source=google&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Paid-Search&amp;utm_campaign=DEPT_FY25_QX_USA_LO_Logi_DTX-Logitech-Shopping_Google_na&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw-e6-BhDmARIsAOxxlxXcxjOTdwo1C956wmE-oX1HHUt3McBCgMz9MioAuJvXjiBa9eJhDKAaAvSFEALw_wcB\">Logitech Ergo K860 keyboard</a>, as I have had some wrist issues. This is my first time using a mechanical keyboard. It’s a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung\">Matter-enabled</a> one by Third Reality, <a href=\"https://3reality.com/product/smart-mechanical-keyboard-mk1/?srsltid=AfmBOookeR1T1OHaaALTgf0bPiF0zqQDPzgK-SLDhgNWZQ69InxDGjAM\">the Smart Mechanical Keyboard MK1</a>. I can set the function keys to control my smart home; they act as individual buttons in Matter-supported ecosystems like Apple Home, so I can turn off all my lights with the stroke of a key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The pink <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23030160/logitech-lift-ergonomic-vertical-wireless-mouse-price-features\">Logitech Lift</a> mouse is my favorite mouse ever. I’ve spent a long time looking for a comfortable mouse that doesn’t aggravate my wrist, and it does the job. I love its scroll wheel, but I set up its buttons to do something useful when I first got it and have never used them since.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s the Belkin DockKit stand (more on that in a bit) and my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ember-Temperature-Control-1-5-hr-Battery/dp/B07NQRM6ML?th=1\">Ember Mug</a> — which is four years old and on its last legs; I really need to get a new one. But I love it. There’s also an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560648/apple-homepod-second-generation-sound-quality-impressions\">Apple HomePod</a> on the bookshelf next to the desk; I use it as a speaker for the Apple TV, which is hooked up to the smart monitor, and it’s also mainly for testing smart home gear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You have a lot of tech that you’ve reviewed or are in the process of reviewing. </strong><strong>How do you keep track of it all?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I have a system; it&#8217;s not perfect, but it largely works. I enter everything into a Notion spreadsheet when it arrives, then store it in various staging areas until I’m ready to test. A lot of this stuff has to be physically installed in my house, so it rarely gets set up the day it arrives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On my workbench, I have the products I’m about to start testing. Currently, there are a couple of smart locks and a few doorbells that will be going in during my next install day. The dollhouse is my daughter&#8217;s and was built by my husband, but she doesn’t have room for it anymore. So, I&#8217;ve adopted it as a thematic staging area for tech that’s next in line for installation / reviewing. I’m about to start testing some new thermostats, so you can see a few in there.&nbsp;It also houses devices I might need to test with a new gadget or compare them to; that’s why the smart displays and smart speakers are there.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0009.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reviewing smart home tech means a lot of storage space is needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0035.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old-fashioned tech is fun to have on hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there’s a closet in the room (behind a curtain) where I store things that either need to be sent back or are further down the line in terms of testing, along with a bunch of older gear. I’m not good at getting rid of stuff — every time I do, I always end up in a situation where I’m like, “Oh no, I needed that Fibaro Z-Wave sensor to test with this new hub.” So, I just store lots of things in lots of boxes to avoid that eventuality. I really need to do a big clear-out of that closet, but I didn’t have time this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, many things I’m currently testing are already installed in the house — which is also technically my office! I have three exterior doors, so I test multiple locks, video doorbells, and sensors on those, as well as smart lights, thermostats, kitchen gadgets, security cameras, smart displays, smart speakers, and lots and lots of robot vacuums everywhere else in the house. I have a dozen robot vacs downstairs right now, as well as the three currently in the office. When the robot revolution happens, I will be the first to go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is there a story behind that painting of the castle on the seashore?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes! A great story. It&#8217;s also not a painting; it&#8217;s a digital collage of hundreds of photos of my close-knit group of girlfriends from high school (from a company called <a href=\"https://mosapics.com/\">MosaPics</a>). They make up the main photo, which is of a tin mine in a small town called Rinsey in Cornwall, England. We’ve been going on holiday there as a group since we were 15. If those ancient walls could talk…&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I see you use an ordinary paper notebook as well as your tech.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve always been a big stationery fan; I used to hang out in Smythson and Paperchases as a teenager (my wild years). I went through a bullet journal phase for a few years, but it was hard to keep it up with this job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, I have a nice Leuchtturm notebook for note-taking during meetings and interviews, and I use tear-off <a href=\"https://www.ramonaandruth.com/products/weekly-keyboard-planner-notepad?gQT=2\">Ramona &amp; Ruth</a> monthly and weekly desk planners to keep track of what I should be doing each day and in the future. Physically writing stuff down helps me retain information much better than typing.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0015.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;In the end, paper can be the best way to keep notes.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I had to notice the typewriter and that dial phone!</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I am… not a minimalist! It&#8217;s a good thing I moved to the US in my mid-20s, which forced me to get rid of a lot of my belongings, or I would probably have all my childhood stuffies on that sofa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The typewriter is an antique <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Luxe-Typewriter-Portable-Professionally/dp/B0DRH9N4S3?gQT=1\">portable Royal Deluxe</a> I picked up at a yard sale in Idaho years ago. It has a carrying case and is so cool. It was going to be the start of my typewriter collection. However, my husband (who <em>is</em> a minimalist) was not keen on that idea and has been trying to get me to get rid of it for a while, as we could never find a good spot for it. In the end, he just built me a shelf to put it on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The phone is deceptive; it’s actually relatively modern, the buttons are push buttons, and it&#8217;s from <a href=\"https://www.potterybarn.com/products/pb-grand-phone/\">Pottery Barn</a>. It was a wedding gift. It was functional for a long time, but I no longer have a landline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>That’s a fascinating little clock / calendar.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s an iPhone in StandBy mode on <a href=\"https://www.belkin.com/p/auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit/MMA008dq05BK.html\">Belkin’s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit</a>. It&#8217;s a super handy gadget. I keep it plugged in at my desk so my phone is charging and easy to see, but it also runs on a built-in battery, so I can take it downstairs if <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7483146093451332910?lang=en\">I’m recording a social video</a> or on a FaceTime call. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/7/24023612/belkin-stand-pro-iphone-dockkit\">DockKit</a> function lets it follow me around by tracking my face and body movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You’ve got a nice, comfortable-looking couch. And a great-looking lighting arrangement above it.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thank you! The couch is a sleeper sofa. It was intended to make this double as a guest room, but the first person who slept on it said it was the most uncomfortable bed they’d ever slept in, so we now have alternative arrangements for guests until we can get a better one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it&#8217;s great as a couch —&nbsp;handy for my family to sit on when they want to come in and bother me or occasionally for relaxing during some deep work. The kitten especially loves it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lighting setup is from Nanoleaf; it’s the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24233728/nanoleaf-blocks-wall-panels-smart-lighting-ifa\">new modular Blocks LED lights</a> that I’m testing. When I’m done with them, I want to frame the Audubon prints that are sitting on my shelf next to the pink flamingo and the silver duck and hang those there. I’m a big bird fan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>There’s a chicken calendar!</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course there is! That was a gift from my husband this Christmas; I don’t really use analog wall calendars (I just flipped it to March from January to take this picture), but I love to have a pretty picture of a pretty bird at my desk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0074.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;An original Himalayan salt lamp atop an air purifier.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0071.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This ”painting” is actually made up of hundreds of tiny photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I have backyard chickens — a flock of lovely ladies, including Barred Rocks, Black Copper Marans, and Starlight Green Eggers. They’re my “touch grass” time every day. I take a break and go out to feed them or collect their eggs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>There’s so much else that looks interesting. Is there anything we didn’t cover that you’d like to add?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The salt lamp on the cute air purifier table (it’s from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236667/switchbot-purifier-table-ifa-2024\">SwitchBot</a> and doubles as a wireless charger) was a wedding present from my aunt before salt lamps became a thing you could buy at Target. It was handmade by my uncle and is a legit original Himalayan salt lamp, not a knockoff; it weighs a ton and creates good vibes in my office!</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Before we end, you must introduce us to your pets.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lazy boy there is Gus, a Wirehaired Pointing Griffon. The black and white kitten is our newest addition and bundle of energy, Boone. Not pictured but who occupies the top spot in the trio of beds in front of the closet is my cat, Smokey, who has already done his <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22928013/how-to-use-zoom-amazon-echo-show-alexa\">fair share of modeling</a> for <em>The Verge, </em>so he declined this opportunity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Boone demands time with the tech.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257641_WOYD_Pattison_Tuohy_JTuohy_0013.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Gus enjoys a nap.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Photos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Called <a href=\"https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/\">Relics</a>, the expansion launches today and introduces paleontology and archaeology elements to the sci-fi exploration game; players can now unearth the bones of alien creatures, piece them together, and even erect museums.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Perhaps most interesting is that players will be able to assemble the ancient creatures however they’d like. Here’s how developer Hello Games explains it:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect. It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Naturally, since this is <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, there’s also an element of danger. Certain bones and underground treasures will be guarded by golem-like creatures and a giant new type of worm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As with all of the game’s major updates, Relics is free to download, and it joins an increasingly massive list of new content for the game since its launch in 2016. Most recently, that has included <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1\">big changes to the game’s graphics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/599537/no-mans-sky-worlds-2-update\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/599537/no-mans-sky-worlds-2-update\">the addition of trillions of new planets</a>, and just as important: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234948/no-mans-fly-fishing\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234948/no-mans-fly-fishing\">fishing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

    "description": "\n              <p><em>Severance</em> has just wrapped up its second season. I sat down with fellow Ars staffers Aaron Zimmerman and Lee Hutchinson to talk through what we had just seen, covering everything from those goats to the show's pacing. Warning: Huge spoilers for seasons 1 and 2 follow!</p>\n<p><strong>Nate:</strong> <em>Severance</em> season 1 was a smaller-scale, almost claustrophobic show about a crazy office, its \"waffle parties,\" and the personal life of Mark Scout, mourning his dead wife and \"severing\" his consciousness to avoid that pain. It followed a compact group of characters, centered around the four \"refiners\" who worked on Lumon's severed floor. But season 2 blew up that cozy/creepy world and started following more characters—including far more \"outies\"—to far more places. Did the show manage to maintain its unique vibe while making significant changes to pacing, character count, and location?</p>\n<p><strong>Lee:</strong> I think so, but as you say, things were different this time around. One element that I’m glad carried through was the show’s consistent use of a very specific visual language. (I am an absolute sucker for visual storytelling. My favorite Kubrick film is <em>Barry Lyndon</em>. I’ll forgive a lot of plot holes if they’re beautifully shot.) Season 2, especially in the back half, treats us to an absolute smorgasbord of incredible visuals—bifurcated shots symbolizing severance and duality, stark whites and long hallways, and my personal favorite: Chris Walken in a black turtleneck seated in front of a fireplace, like Satan holding court in Hell. The storytelling might be a bit less focused, but it looks great.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/praise-kier-for-severance-season-2-lets-discuss/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/praise-kier-for-severance-season-2-lets-discuss/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

Not nearly as much as I expected, though, for the middle of February at the northern end of Sweden. I've flown here to drift electric Polestars on an icy lake called Stor-Skabram, near the small outpost of Jokkmokk, fully above the Arctic Circle. Yet the balmy weather serves as a constant reminder of the climate change that inspires much of the narrative around the electric vehicle industry.</p>\n<h2>EVs on ice</h2>\n<p>An opportunity to get somebody else's cars sideways as much as possible on ice and snow is a particularly enjoyable way to spend a day, if you like driving cars. More importantly, automotive manufacturers rely on this kind of winter testing to fine-tune traction and stability-control programming, ensuring their cars can work well in the depths of the deepest winter. For EVs in particular, winter testing presents a more complex range of equations.</p>\n<p>First of all, an EV can't ever turn the electronic nannies off entirely, because electric motors will rev to the moon with instantaneous torque the very instant their tires lose traction. So while software uses wheel speed sensors and regenerative braking, as well as accelerometers that detect yaw rates, each EV needs to then maintain progressive output responses to driver inputs that allow for confident performance and safety simultaneously.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/how-polestar-engineers-evs-that-can-handle-brutal-winters/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/how-polestar-engineers-evs-that-can-handle-brutal-winters/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

Hinton 正在为图像识别竞赛 ImageNet LSRVC 开发一种卷积神经网络。在当时图像识别是非常有挑战性的。研究人员认为他们需要一个庞大的神经网络，该网络以首席研究员的名字命名为 AlexNet，它有超过 6000 万参数和 65 万个神经元。但一大问题是如此大的神经网络如何进行训练？他们的实验室里有几张英伟达 GTX 580 显卡，每张配备了 3GB 显存，但 AlexNet 太大没办法加载到单张显卡上。研究人员设法将训练阶段划分到两张并行工作的 GPU 上——一半神经元在一张 GPU 上，另一半在另一张上运行。AlexNet 以压倒性优势赢得了 2012 年的比赛，从此 AI 模型的规模不再受限于单张显卡了，而妖精也从瓶子里释放了出来。在 AlexNet 之后，越来越强大的 AI 模型需要成千上万张 GPU。根据 Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)的报告，2010 年到 2020 年间数据中心的功耗相对平稳，原因是英伟达数据中心 GPU 的功耗同期提升了大约 15 倍，因此能保持数据中心功耗的稳定。到了 2022 年基于 transformer 的大模型的出现推动了数据中心功耗的大幅提升。大模型需要处理数百亿甚至数千亿个神经元，训练之后的推理阶段还需要处理大量数据。Open AI 在训练新模型时使用了超过 25,000 张英伟达 Ampere 100 GPU，持续了 100 天，耗电量 50 GW 时，足以满足一个中型城镇一年的电力需求。根据 Google 的数据，训练占 AI 模型生命周期总耗电量的四成，剩下的六成是推理。功耗的飙升促使科学家思考如何在不牺牲性能的情况下减少内存和计算要求。研究人员尝试了模型剪枝、量化等优化方法。",

    "description": "马德里卡洛斯三世大学与亚利桑那州立大学以及萨拉曼卡大学联合开展的一项科学研究表明，家族企业比非家族企业表现出更多的环境责任行为，更具可持续性。在这项研究中，家族企业被定义为创始人或其亲属、后代拥有至少 25% 投票权的企业。研究发现，当家族企业成员加入董事会并参与公司管理时，家族企业推行减少温室气体排放的绿色政策的意愿会更加强烈。该项研究基于来自22个欧洲国家的数据（研究结果可推广至整个欧洲），并表明采取此类旨在促进环境可持续性做法的家族企业也取得了优异的财务业绩。“这可能令人惊讶，但我们的研究表明，减少污染不仅不会给社会带来成本，也不会给企业带来‘经济代价’，实际上还可以提升与企业社会责任相关的行动所带来的社会和经济效益。”",

    "description": "标准宇宙模型「ΛCDM（Lambda-Cold Dark Matter，宇宙常数–冷暗物质模型）」是现代宇宙学的主流理论架构，成功解释了宇宙中大尺度结构的形成与演化。根据该模型，宇宙中仅有约 5% 的物质为的普通物质，其余则由暗物质（约25%）与暗能量（约70%）构成。暗能量被视为驱动宇宙加速膨胀的来源，并假设其能量密度随时间保持不变，也就是所谓的「宇宙常数（Λ）」。然而两项最新的大型国际合作计划，暗能量光谱仪（DESI）与暗能量调查（DES），其研究开始挑战这项假设，指出暗能量可能会随时间演化，进而动摇我们对宇宙膨胀的基本认识。根据 DESI 本身的资料分析，初步结果与标准宇宙模型 ΛCDM 基本一致。然而，当研究团队将这些观测结果进一步与宇宙微波背景辐射、超新星与弱重力透镜等其他观测资料结合时，发现暗能量的影响力可能随时间减弱，显示宇宙学常数可能并非真正的「常数」。目前的统计偏离程度为 2.8 至 4.2 个标准差，虽尚未达到物理学界公认的 5 个标准差门槛，但足以引起学术界的高度关注与讨论。",
