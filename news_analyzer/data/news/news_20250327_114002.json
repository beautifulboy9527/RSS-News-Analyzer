This live blog is closed Meanwhile, Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson has confirmed the country plans to increase the country’s defence spending to a provisional target of 3.5% of GDP by 2030 in the largest push since the end of cold war. Sweden was expected to spend 2.14% in 2024, with projections reaching 2.4% this year, and 2.6% in 2028. Let’s not forget that Russia is and remains the most significant and dark threat to our alliance. Let’s not forget that Russia is moving into a wartime economy. And that will have a huge impact on their capacity and capability to build their armed forces. When it comes to the defence of Poland and the general defence of Nato territory, if anyone were to miscalculate and think they can get away with an attack on Poland or on any other ally, they will be met with the full force of this fierce alliance. Our reaction will be devastating. This has to be very clear to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and anyone else who … wants to attack us. Continue reading...",

    "description": "YouTube Shorts has introduced a change that brings analytics for its bite-sized video option into closer parity with rival services TikTok and Instagram. The video platform will remove the minimum play time requirement it previously had for a user watching a clip to count as a view. Beginning March 31, a &quot;view&quot; will be added any time a YouTube Short is played or replayed. This will likely mean that creators will see higher view counts after the change takes place. YouTube will continue to track &quot;engaged views,&quot; which measure the number of times a clip was played &quot;for a certain number of seconds.&quot; YouTube clarified that the shift would not impact Creator earnings or their eligibility for the YouTube Partner Program; both will continue to be assessed by the engaged view metric. Both Instagram and TikTok have defined a &quot;view&quot; as the number of times a video starts playing, although those platforms also offer metrics for tracking time spent watching a piece of content. Considering YouTube Shorts , Instagram and TikTok have each claimed upwards of a billion monthly users, it makes sense that they count views similarly so that creators can better assess how many of those people they are reaching across the services.

    "description": "Utah Governor Spencer Cox has signed the App Store Accountability Act into law, making it the first state to require that app store makers verify their users&#39; ages. Under this law , people in Utah will need to be over age 18 to make a new account with an app store; underage users will either need to link their account to a parent&#39;s so that the adult can give permission for the child to use certain apps. The legislation is intended to protect children and teens, according to bill sponsor Todd Weiler, a Republican state senator. However, it has also raised questions about privacy and where the burden of responsibility falls to ensure that underage users don&#39;t see inappropriate content. Meta, Snap and X have supported the measure. &quot;We applaud Governor Cox and the State of Utah for being the first in the nation to empower parents and users with greater control over teen app downloads, and urge other states to consider this groundbreaking approach,&quot; the three companies said in a joint statement Wednesday. &quot;This approach spares users from repeatedly submitting personal information to countless individual apps and online services.&quot; Google, which runs the Play Store, had opposed the bill, and called on the governor to veto the measure. We&#39;ve reached out to Apple and Google for comment now that the bill has been signed into law. As it stands, the App Store Accountability Act is slated to take effect on May 7, but it seems likely that it will face legal challenges. Digital privacy groups have opposed the law and others like it, noting security concerns about how sensitive age verification data will be used or protected. Other state laws requiring online services to confirm users&#39; ages have also prompted lawsuits.

    "description": "Amazon&#39;s Big Spring Sale is much less focused on electronics than something like Prime Day or Black Friday, but it still includes a handful of tech deals worth calling out. If you’re looking to grab a new gadget on the cheap, we’ve rounded up the best of those that are available for less than $50. Some of the discounts have technically been available for a few days, but the offers still cover several devices we recommend in our various buying guides . As a reminder, Amazon says this latest sitewide sale will run through March 31, and you don&#39;t need to be a Prime member to access most of the deals.&nbsp; Best Amazon Spring Sale deals under $50 Anker PowerConf C200 for $48 ($12 off MSRP) : The PowerConf C200 is our favorite webcam for those on a tighter budget due to its crisp video quality, easy setup, solid microphones and built-in privacy cover. Its USB cable is on the shorter side, and it can’t match the overall accuracy of our top pick, but it’s still a clear upgrade over a built-in laptop camera for a much lower price. This is another deal we’ve seen numerous times in the last year, but it’s as low as the camera usually goes. Also at Anker . Anker 525 Charging Station for $30 ($36 off) : We recommend this reliable desktop charging station in our remote worker gift guide . It can’t provide the absolute fastest charge to your smartphone or laptop (topping out at a quick enough 67W), but it packs four USB ports — two USB-C, two USB-A — and three AC outlets in a frame that’s small enough to fit on a crowded desk. This deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . The Anker 525 Charging Station. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anker Nano Charger 30W for $13 ($10 off) : It’s hard to have too many portable wall chargers on standby. This one from Anker should be particularly useful for traveling: At just over an inch thick, it’s small enough to fit in a pocket, while its 30W USB-C port is enough to top up recent iPhones at full speed. (That’s not enough for some newer Android phones , though.) This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . Amazon Music Unlimited 3-month trial for free ($24 off) : Amazon is offering new subscribers three months of its Music Unlimited streaming service for free. Normally, it gives new users a one-month trial. Though Music Unlimited isn’t a top pick in our guide to the best music services , it still gets you lossless streaming quality and an extensive library of both music and podcasts. You could do worse if you just want to bum a few months of music streaming for no cost. Just note that your subscription will auto-renew once the trial period ends until you cancel. The Blink Mini 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Blink Mini 2 for $20 ($20 off) : This deal ties the lowest price to date for the Blink Mini 2, which is the budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras . This one comes with its share of trade-offs for the low price — its image quality isn’t the best, it locks certain features behind a paywall and it won’t automatically arm when you leave the house — but it still provides functional 1080p video, color night vision, motion alerts and Alexa support in a weather-resistant frame. It’s fairly simple to set up, too, though you’ll need to buy an external module if you want to store clips locally. Also at Best Buy , Lowe&#39;s and The Home Depot . Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Unlike the AirTag, it can also attach directly to a keychain. It probably isn’t the safest choice for long-distance travel, but it’s a convenient security blanket if you, say, leave your keys or wallet behind at a restaurant. This is another discount that’s been available for a few weeks, but it’s just 10 cents more the best price we’ve seen.

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals: Save up to $200 on AirPods, iPads and more",

    "description": "Amazon&#39;s Big Spring Sale may be aimed at things like apparel and outdoor goods more than electronics, but we’ve cut through the noise and found a few actually decent tech deals anyway. If you’re specifically looking for a new Apple device, good news: Various AirPods, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and Beats speakers are at or near their lowest prices to date. Many of these discounts aren’t explicitly tied to the sale, but if you’re just trying to save a few bucks, that shouldn’t matter much. We’ve rounded up the best Spring Sale Apple deals we could find below. As a reminder: Amazon says the event will run through March 31, and you don&#39;t need to be a Prime member to access any of the offers below.&nbsp; Best Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $149 ($30 off MSRP) : This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple’s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn’t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a score of 86 in our review. This discount is $11 higher than the best price we’ve seen, but it’s about as low as the earbuds have fallen outside of that. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. Also at Best Buy . The Apple Watch Series 10. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off) : The top pick in our guide to the best smartwatches , the Series 10 is a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer profile and a marginally larger display compared to the previous Series 9. That said, it remains a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. It should be a welcome upgrade if you’re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch (think pre-Series 7) — just keep in mind a patent dispute has locked it out the blood oxygen detection features found on those older models. This $100 discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the non-cellular model with a 42mm case. Also at Best Buy and Walmart . Apple Mac mini (M4 Pro) for $1,199 ($200 off) : It&#39;s still not cheap, but here&#39;s the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for this higher-spec configuration of the latest Mac mini, which includes an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. This specific model is overkill for casual users, but it should be a decent buy for those with more professional needs who want a compact Mac but can’t spring for the top-end Mac Studio . We gave the Mac mini a score of 90 in our review last November, praising its performance, pint-sized design and port selection, though it can get noisy under load and it still lacks an SD card reader. Also at B&amp;H . The M4 Pro Mac mini. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget Apple iPad (A16) for $329 ($20 off) : The newest entry-level iPad only arrived three weeks ago, but Amazon is currently selling it for $20 less than Apple direct, which is a decent little savings if you planned on grabbing the tablet early anyway. This one is another small update, but it now comes with a faster A16 chip, more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for media consumption and lighter work, it&#39;s still a fine value. Also at B&amp;H and Best Buy . Apple iPad Air 11-inch (M3) for $549 ($50 off) : Much like the deal on the base iPad above, this isn’t a huge discount, but it’s a nice chance to save a few bucks compared to buying from Apple directly. The new iPad Air was released on the same day as the iPad (A16) and is a similarly minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still prefer the Air over the base model if you can swing it: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. The older M2-powered model is an even better value if you can find it on sale, but either way the Air is the iPad we recommend to most people. Also at B&amp;H , Best Buy and Walmart . The 13-inch iPad Air M3. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $738 ($61 off) : We gave the 13-inch iPad Air a review score of 89 earlier this month. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 128GB model. Also at Walmart . Apple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off) : The iPad Pro is more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being how expensive it all is. This deal on doesn’t truly lessen that — and it’s another deal we’ve seen multiple times in recent months — but it still ties the 13-inch model’s all-time low.

    "description": "The Amazon Big Spring Sale isn’t as huge as, say, the company’s (two) Prime Day sales, but there are still plenty of deals to be found — particularly on goods for your home. While Engadget doesn’t test sheets and pillows, we do put our review skills to work on kitchen tech . We’ve combed through Amazon&#39;s long lists of what&#39;s on sale and found a good number of deals on the cooking gear we recommend. So if you’re in the market for a discount on a sous vide machine , coffee kettle or an air fryer , this is a good list to check out. The best Amazon Spring Sale deals on air fryers, Instant Pots and more Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $140 ($40 off) : The powerful Juice Fountain impressed us with its extraction abilities. Plus it’s relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This price isn’t as low as the $110 Amazon sold it for back in January, but this is the lowest price we’ve tracked since then. Anova Culinary Sous Vide Precision Cooker Nano for $100 ($50 off) : This is the machine that led our editor to dub these machines the “Millennial crockpot.” She uses this one a few times a week to make unfussy meals that keep her alive. The Nano model is a slightly smaller and less expensive version of the top pick in our buyer’s guide. This is about $10 more than the all-time low, but is the cheapest we’ve seen Amazon sell it for over the past couple of months. Cosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off) : Cosori’s fryer earned a spot as the runner up for best overall air fryer in our guide. It has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity. We like that it doesn’t take up too much space, but can still cook up a decent amount of food Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off) : If you want a more traditional toaster oven design with a huge capacity, go for our premium air fryer pick. The fryer-and-oven combo can accommodate a five-quart dutch oven, so it’s almost an auxiliary oven, which could come in handy when you’re cooking for a crowd. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it went for $300 at the end of last year. Breville the Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off) : This is the non-Pro version of the Breville air fryer we recommend . It has a slightly smaller capacity (0.8 cubic feet instead of one cubic foot) and is missing two cooking functions (dehydrate and proof). But if you’re not making your own jerky or baking a ton of bread, this one can toast, broil, air fry and slow cook. You can even get it in cool colors like Red Velvet Cake for the same price. Ninja DZ401 Foodi 10-quart air fryer for $190 ($40 off) : If you need to air fry two different foods at once, go for our recommendation for a dual-zone air fryer. It’s a beast, so we think it’s best for larger kitchens and people who make big meals. It went as low as $130 for Black Friday last year, but this is the cheapest price we’ve seen since then. Instant Vortex 2QT Mini Air Fryer for $50 ($10 off) : The budget pick in our guide doesn’t go on sale often — it’s already pretty cheap at its $60 list price. It’s sold for as little as $48 for Prime Day in July, but this is the cheapest we’ve seen since then. Its two-quart capacity is probably best for small kitchens and can crisp up food for one or two people. Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $90 $40 off) : We like this Instant Pot model because it&#39;s simple to use and has several quick-cooking modes including beans, cake, sous vide and more. It went as low as $70 earlier this year, but this is still a 30 percent discount off the list price. Instant Pot Pro Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $138 ($61 off) : We also suggest this fancier Pro Plus model in our guide to kitchen tech . It’s a Wi-Fi connected unit with a canning function and you can even release the steam remotely using the companion app — which has over 800 recipes. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it was $125 earlier this week and dipped as low as $99 for Black Friday last year.&nbsp; Ninja AF150AMZ Air Fryer for $120 (25 percent off) : This went as low as $100 for the holidays last year, but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen since then. The fryer gets an honorable mention in our air fryer guide because it makes good use of limited counter space with its taller design. The round cooking basket doesn’t feel as roomy as square ones but it does have a dehydrate option that other cookers don’t come with. Anova Culinary Sous Vide 3.0 for $129 ($70 off) : We named this the best overall sous vide machine after testing a number of models for our buyer’s guide. This is about $30 more than the low it hit for the holidays last year, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. We appreciate the easy digital controls and found that the high flow rate maintains water temperature better than other machines. Plus, if you’re at a loss for what to cook, you can check out the companion app which is replete with recipes. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $165 ($30 off) : This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. This is the pro model of the version we recommend in our tea guide . KitchenAid Artisan 5-quart stand mixer for $380 ($80 off) : Small wonder that the home cook’s gold standard of mixers made its way onto our kitchen tech guide . Its ton of available attachments can be used to make pasta, grind food, strain or spiralize fruits and veggies and more. This is no unitasker. This is a solid $80 discount off of the MSRP, but we’ll note that Amazon sold it for as low as $330 at the end of last year and for $350 last month. KitchenAid Go Cordless Hand Blender for $100 ($30 off) : The big selling point here is the removable battery that you can use for other KitchenAid Go appliances. In our testing, it had enough power to turn a roasted butternut squash into a smooth, creamy soup. The blender has hit this price a few times over the past few months and the deal isn’t as good as the $77 it sold for at the end of last year.

    "description": "This year’s Amazon Spring Sale is in full swing, and as promised, a ton of household, fashion and outdoor gear has dropped to record-low prices. Tech isn’t a huge focus for this sale, but there are a decent number of devices on sale right now for some of the best prices we’ve seen all year. The selection may not be as good as that of Amazon Prime Day in July, but it still provides a good opportunity to save on things like headphones, robot vacuums, air purifiers and more. We’ve collected the best Amazon Spring Sale deals on tech gear here so you don’t have to go searching for them. The Spring Sale runs through March 31, so check back here for all of the latest deals as they drop. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals 10th-gen iPad for $269 (23 percent off): The previous version of most affordable iPad gives you an A14 Bionic chip, a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, TouchID built into the lock button and more. It’s compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the keyboard folio, plus we found it to have solid performance and a matching battery life. Dyson AM09 heater and fan for $300 (36 percent off): The AM09 has been around for ages, and for good reason. It&#39;s an excellent heater during cold months and fan during warm months, so you can use it all year round. Jet Focus control lets you choose from Focused or Diffused for personal or whole-room heating or cooling, and the handy sleep timer lets you set when the device turns off in intervals from 15 minutes up to nine hours. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off): This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off): A version of one of our favorite air fryers , this air fryer toaster oven has 11 cooking modes including air fry, broil, bake, roast and more, and it has a large capacity that can fit up to six slices of bread at once or a 13-inch pizza. The Pro model is also on sale, down to $320 from $400. Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $318 (20 percent off): These top our list of the best wireless headphones you can get right now thanks to their supreme comfort, excellent sound quality and ANC, multipoint connectivity and 30-hour battery life. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. A quick-charge feature will net you 2.5 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging, so you&#39;ll rarely have to go without them, too. Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones for $349 ($80 off): These hold the top spot in our best wireless headphones guide for excellent noise cancellation. These cans will give you a step up in ANC, blocking out most noise and chatter of those around you. General audio quality has been improved as well, and they have a comfy fit. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $20 (43 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget streaming device can play content at 1080p/60fps and now its remote can also control your TV&#39;s power and volume. There&#39;s also Alexa support built into the remote, so you can use voice commands to search for content. Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $169 ($80 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you&#39;re on the market for a new desktop, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Beats Studio Pro for $180 (49 percent off): These Beats headphones have improved sound quality, good Transparency mode and USB-C charging, plus decent mic quality for phone calls. They support wired USB-C audio, plus they have solid ANC as well. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Blink Mini 2 for $20 (50 percent off): Blink&#39;s latest wired, indoor security camera is one of our favorites , particularly if you&#39;re just starting out building a security camera system. It&#39;s easy to set up and use, and it works seamlessly with Amazon&#39;s Alexa. Plus, if you want a local storage option, you can buy the Blink Sync Module 2 and a thumb drive to store video clips locally. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $300 ($138 off): This is a version of one of our top picks in our best robot vacuums guide. Shark makes excellent robovacs with strong suction power and convenient bagless, self-emptying bases. This model in particular can hold up to 60 days worth of debris before its base needs to be emptied. If you want a machine that can mop in addition to vacuum, consider Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac , which is 47 percent off and down to $400. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $149 (45 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 ($30 off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. Levoit Core 400S air purifier for $190 ($30 off with coupon): Our top pick for the best air purifier for most people, the Core 400S has easy-to-use onboard controls, powerful filtering technology that isn&#39;t too loud and relatively affordable replacement filters. It reliably improved air quality in our testing, and even though its mobile app is a little overstuffed, it gives you another way to control and monitor the device. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals: The best sales from Shark, iRobot, Dyson and others",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-robot-vacuum-deals-the-best-sales-from-shark-irobot-dyson-and-others-092652375.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The big news in robot vacuums right now is iRobot’s announcement that it’s not confident in its ability to continue operating. That’s surprising considering the Roomba’s dominance in the automated floor-bot market. The company also makes up more than a few top picks in our budget and standard robo vac buying guides . Fortunately, a number of other brands make great vacs, too — and Roombas are still available. Thanks to Amazon’s Big Spring Sale this week, a number of robot vacuums are seeing decent discounts right now. We also found deals on a few of our recommended cordless stick vacs, for those who prefer to tackle their floors manually. The best Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac for $400 ($350 off) : In our testing, we’ve been consistently impressed with Shark vacuums — but they’re not cheap. This machine can mop in addition to vacuum and is nearly half price at 47 percent off. Shark Robot PowerDetect NeverTouch vac and mop combo for $500 ($400 off) : This is the non-pro model of our runner up pick for the best combo bot. It mops and vacuums, quickly making a map of your home on its first run. The app easily lets you program where your hard and carpeted surfaces are, as well as set schedules. The base empties the dry debris and dirty water, then refills it with new water. The difference between this model and the Pro version is that this one doesn’t clean the mop with each use, so you may need to manually perform that task more often — but the price difference may make up for that lack. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off) : This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX for $140 (44 percent off) : The “S” in the model name stands for “slim” and it was one of the more low-profile machines we tried. It’s a pick in our guide to budget robot vacuums and has a long battery life and good suction power for its price. The main drawback is the lack of Wi-Fi, so instead of programming it with your phone, you’ll use the included remote. The best cordless vacuum deals Tineco Pure ONE Station 5 for $349 ($110 off) : This vac earned an honorable mention in our tests. The self-emptying base is a big selling point. We also liked the auto-adjusting suction and single-button start feature. The fact that it doesn’t require proprietary bags helps keep down the long-term cost, too. &nbsp; Tineco Pure ONE S11 cordless vacuum for $200 ($100 off with coupon) : Click the coupon to get $95 off our top pick for a budget stick vac. We like that it automatically adjusts suction depending on what it&#39;s picking up and is relatively lightweight when you’re pushing it around your floors. The bin is on the small side and the battery life isn’t as good as on other models, but it’s an easy-to-use, no-frills way to clean floors. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off) : This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Tineco Pure ONE Station FurFree for $400 ($300 off) : Of all the stick vacs our reviewer tried for our guide , this is the one she wanted to use the most. It’s super convenient with a dock that charges and empties and cleans all parts of the machine — brush, tube and dustbin — after each use. Plus the suction power is great and the iLoop smart sensor kicks up the suction when needed.

    "description": "Codemasters&#39; Formula 1 franchise is back for another lap. Publisher EA says the tracks in F1 2025 have a more realistic look and feel, thanks to LiDAR scanning. The new installment arrives on May 30. Although EA didn&#39;t offer much detail about LiDAR&#39;s use, we can safely assume it involved high-resolution 3D scans of real-world tracks to make them as close to a 1:1 representation as possible. (After all, it&#39;s the same tech autonomous vehicles use for real-time 3D mapping and object detection.) Regardless, we reached out to EA to try to get more info. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back. EA / Codemasters In other areas, F1 25 overhauls My Team, with players now able to serve as the squad&#39;s owner and driver. And in the Braking Point story mode, Konnersport has moved up in the world and is now a highly competitive team battling for championships. But wait, &quot;a dramatic event throws the team into chaos,&quot; so rest assured the writing team still understands the importance of using obstacles in storytelling. F1 25 launches on PS5 , Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 30. If you own F1 23 or F1 24 , you can save 15 percent off your pre-order of the game&#39;s Iconic Edition, which typically costs $80 on PC and $90 on consoles. That variant will add post-launch Braking Point chapters that tie into Apple&#39;s upcoming film F1 , starring Brad Pitt. Meanwhile, the base game costs $60 on PC and $70 on PlayStation and Xbox. You can check out the trailer below, featuring cover star Lewis Hamilton.

    "description": "Samsung just released a spate of new QLED TVs, after teasing the lineup at CES . The Neo QLED line is the first to feature the company’s Vision AI platform. This allows for new personalization and optimization features. You can pick one up right now, but you might want to open up a line of credit first. The most budget-friendly model is the 55-inch Class Neo QLED 4K QN80F, which comes in at $1,300. As for 4K models, prices balloon all the way up to $15,000 for the top-of-the-line 98-inch Class Neo QLED 4K QN90F. Samsung also just released some 8K smart TVs with Vision AI. The pricing here starts at $3,300 for a 65-inch model and goes up to $5,300 for the 85-inch version.&nbsp; If you need a high-end soundbar to go with that brand new TV, Samsung has got you covered. The company just announced availability for two new soundbar systems. The flagship HW-Q990F costs $1,800 and the HW-Q800F clocks in at $1,000. Both come with the company’s redesigned subwoofer, but the Q990F also includes a pair of rear speakers. Samsung They support wireless Dolby Atmos technology, so the cable clutter can go the way of the dodo. All of these products are available right now from Samsung or via third-party retailers.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/the-latest-kindle-update-lets-you-turn-pages-by-double-tapping-175452454.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon has updated Kindles with a new way to navigate books. While nothing will recapture the tactile pleasure of physical page turn buttons, anyone with a Kindle running Version 5.18.1 of Amazon&#39;s software will now be able to double-tap the side or back of their e-reader to turn pages. &quot;Double Tap to Page Turn&quot; can be turned on in the Settings menu under Device Options. Amazon says it works for more than just turning pages. You can also use double taps to scroll through your Home and Library pages, too. Interestingly, the option doesn&#39;t use the touchscreen at all. Good E-Reader speculates Amazon is relying on the accelerometer inside Kindles to detect taps. Along with the update, Amazon is also adding a feature it calls &quot;Recaps for Books in Series.&quot; These are short summaries &quot;for thousands of bestselling English language Kindle books in series you have purchased or borrowed.&quot; The company already does things like automatically group books from the same series to make them easier to find, but this should save you the trouble of looking up a summary of A Dance with Dragons before diving into The Winds of Winter — assuming it&#39;s ever released. The 5.18.1 update is rolling out now newer Kindles, like the Kindle Colorsoft , and devices as old as the 10th generation Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite. It will also be available on the last of Amazon&#39;s e-readers to have physical buttons, the Kindle Oasis . If you don&#39;t see it on your device now, you can manually download the update from Amazon&#39;s website and install it yourself.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apps/waze-is-officially-stopping-support-for-google-assistant-on-iphones-173545610.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The navigation app Waze is dropping Google Assistant support for iPhones , citing &quot;ongoing difficulties&quot; with integrating the service. The company says it plans on replacing it with an &quot;enhanced voice integration solution&quot; at some point in the future. Google Assistant will still work for Android users. This is happening a full year after iPhone users began reporting issues related to Google Assistant, with many people noting that voice commands were totally broken. Waze says that it has &quot;not been working as intended for over a year&quot; and that it would rather &quot;phase out Google Assistant on iOS&quot; instead of &quot;patching a feature that has faced ongoing difficulties.&quot; As previously stated, Google Assistant for Waze will continue to work on Android phones. However, there’s a valid question to be asked about how long Android users will continue to be able to issue voice commands in the app via the digital assistant. Google has pledged to transition users away from Google Assistant to Gemini. As a matter of fact, the company said that &quot;the classic Google Assistant will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices&quot; as the year winds on. It’ll also no longer be available for downloads on app stores starting later this year. Waze has already begun testing Gemini within the platform , which allows users to use natural language to report traffic incidents.

    "title": "Canon goes all in on vlogging with the PowerShot V1 compact and R50 V mirrorless cameras",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-goes-all-in-on-vlogging-with-the-powershot-v1-compact-and-r50-v-mirrorless-cameras-170047522.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Canon is expanding its vlogging lineup in a big way with two new models, the R50 V mirrorless and PowerShot V1 compact, both designed to take on cameras in Sony&#39;s vlogging lineup. The PowerShot V1 has an interesting new 1.4-inch sensor that&#39;s considerably larger than the ones on most compact cameras. The R50 V, meanwhile, matches features from Sony&#39;s ZV-E10 II but at a considerably lower price.&nbsp; PowerShot V1 compact camera The PowerShot V1 was already announced and released in Japan, but it&#39;s now set to come to North America. It effectively competes with Sony&#39;s ZV-1 II 1-inch sensor compact but has a much larger 1.4-inch 22.3MP sensor that&#39;s roughly the same size as Micro Four Thirds, but with a horizontal aspect ratio better suited for video. That larger size, along with the 17-52mm (3.1x zoom) f/2.8-4.5 lens, should make it superior to its rival in low light while also offering shallower depth of field. I&#39;ve only had the PowerShot V1 for a day, but it&#39;s heavy for a compact camera at 426 grams (15 ounces) and fairly thick. There aren&#39;t many manual controls other than the top mode dial, a rear setting dial for burst, exposure compensation and other functions, a lens dial for aperture, a camera/video switch and a zoom dial, along with several buttons. It has a 3-inch, one-million-dot fully articulating rear display but no electronic viewfinder, just like the ZV-1 II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Dent for Engadget It can shoot 4K 30 fps supersampled video using the full sensor width, 4K 60p video with a 1.4 times crop or 1080p at 240 fps. Also supported is Canon C-Log3 with 10-bit 4:2:2 capture to improve dynamic range and allow for easier grading. Optical along with digital enhanced stabilization are available and to allay overheating it comes with a built-in cooling fan that allows unlimited shooting times at all resolutions. Like the ZV-1 II, the PowerShot V1 supports several shooting modes aimed at creators. Those include a &quot;close-up demo mode&quot; that&#39;s equivalent to Sony&#39;s &quot;product showcase,&quot; allowing the camera to quickly focus on an object you hold in front of the camera. Another is &quot;smooth skin mode&quot; for beauty-style shooting, plus &quot;movie IS mode&quot; for vloggers that stabilizes any jolting movements like walking.&nbsp; Steve Dent for Engadget The PowerShot V1 uses Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel II autofocus system with subject detection and face/eye tracking and includes a &quot;subject tracking IS&quot; mode that automatically adjusts cropping to center the subject in the frame. You can use it as a 1080p webcam via the USB-C port, while connecting to your smartphone for live streaming. For photography, it sports a physical mechanical shutter and can shoot bursts at up to 30 fps with autofocus in electronic shutter mode. A welcome feature is a built-in ND filter (equivalent to three stops of light reduction) that will allow creators to add more bokeh on sunny days.&nbsp; Other features include support for a smallish LP-E17 battery and a single UHS-II card slot along with microphone, headphone and microHDMI connectors. However, the PowerShot V1 isn&#39;t cheap at $900. It&#39;s set to arrive in April 2025.&nbsp; EOS R50 V Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V is Canon&#39;s first true mirrorless vlogging-specific camera and is clearly designed to go up against Sony&#39;s ZV-E10 II. It&#39;s slightly taller than the PowerShot V1 but has largely the same dimensions otherwise, and weighs just a bit more if you include the new 14-30mm (21-45mm full-frame equivalent) f/4-6.3 power zoom lens.&nbsp; It has a nice array of manual controls including a primary control dial on top, a zoom rocker for supported lenses and an unusual mode dial that lets you select multiple custom video and vlogging modes including Movie Auto Slow Shutter, Slow/Fast Motion Recording and Movie IS Mode. For vloggers it has a fully-articulating 3-inch display but again, no electronic viewfinder. Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V comes with a 24MP APS-C sensor like the EOS R50 , while also including features from Canon&#39;s Cinema EOS system like C-Log3 capture and 10-bit 4:2:2 video. It can capture supersampled 4K 30 fps video using the full sensor width, 4K 60p video with a crop or 120 fps 1080p video. It&#39;s not a bad camera for photographers either, letting them shoot 12 fps bursts using the first-curtain shutter or 15 fps with the electronic shutter, all with continuous autofocus enabled.&nbsp; Like the ZV-E10 II it lacks in-body stabilization but does offer optical stabilization with supported lenses, along with electronic stabilization. For situations that require extra shake reduction, the optical and electronic stabilization modes can be combined and there&#39;s an enhanced IS mode for abrupt movements like walking. Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V has vlogging-friendly modes like a product showcase-type function along with focus breathing correction. You get Canon&#39;s latest Dual Pixel II autofocus system that includes face and eye detection as well as subject tracking for people, animals and vehicles (along with an auto mode). A dedicated button allows you to livestream instantly with four modes supported: UVC/UAC, HDMI, Camera Connect, and Live Switcher Mobile multi-camera. It comes with a single UHS-II card slot and an LP-E17 battery, along with microphone, headphone, microHDMI and USB-C ports. The R50 V will cost $650 for the body only or $850 with the new RF-S14-30mm F4-6.3 IS STM PZ lens (sold separately for $330). Canon also announced the $1,700 RF 20mm f/1.4L VCM full-frame lens, the latest in its fast hybrid cinema-friendly series that includes the RF24mm f/1.4, RF 35mm f/1.4 and RF 50mm f/1.4 models. As mentioned, I&#39;ve only had the R50 V and PowerShot V1 cameras for a short time but you can expect a full review of both models shortly.

    "description": "The Kindle Colorsoft e-reader is on sale for $225 as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . That’s a discount of 20 percent, as the typical price hovers at $280. This deal also comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited, which is a good way to rack up some quick reads. We loved the Colorsoft in our official review , calling it the &quot;missing link in Amazon’s e-reader lineup.&quot; The reason is right in the name. This is the only Kindle with a color screen. The company led the e-reader space for 17 years before releasing a model that could display color. Amazon says it took so long because the technology just wasn’t good enough to implement until recently. The end result? The colors do really pop. This is a great choice for those who primarily read full-color materials like comics and graphic novels. There’s a pinch-to-zoom feature to get closer to details and an auto-adjusting front light. Just like most modern Kindles, the pages turn fast and the lag is minimal. It’s also waterproof, for reading poolside or in the bathtub. This model doesn’t include lock screen ads by default, which is nice. The primary downside here is the cost. It’s hard to recommend any e-reader for $280, even if it displays color. This is a premium product, however, so it’s easy to recommend it at $225.

    "description": "Indie publishers and developers are once again teaming up to show off the fruits of their labor in a gaming showcase from The Triple-i Initiative. The second edition will take place on April 10 (the same date as last year&#39;s show) at noon ET. The first showcase included the announcements of The Rogue Prince of Persia and Slay the Spire 2 , along with expansion reveals for Brotato and Vampire Survivors . Major updates for Palworld , Risk of Rain 2 and V Rising were unveiled as well. This time around, you can expect 45 minutes of world premieres, gameplay reveals, release dates, demo drops and more from 30-plus games. V Rising will be on show again this year, alongside the likes of Enshrouded and Deep Rock Galactic . The showcase trailer includes a peek at Sifu developer Sloclap &#39;s intriguing 5v5 arcade soccer game, Rematch , so it looks like we&#39;ll get an update on that one. Vampire Survivors studio Poncle is also among the list of developers with something to reveal. Not only that, Playstack, the publisher of a little game called Balatro , has something up its sleeve. &quot;We had been saving our big announcement for a special showcase,&quot; Marta Matyjewicz, marketing manager at Playstack, said in a statement. &quot;We were amazed by the quality of last year’s Triple-i, so when the opportunity came to be a part of it, we knew we had to take it. It’s truly an honor to showcase our game alongside so many awesome titles.&quot; Insert three side eyes emoji here. You&#39;ll be able to watch the showcase on several platforms, including YouTube, Twitch, Bilibili and Steam. After the main event, there will be a post-show including deep dives on some of the games. A week-long sale featuring games from both editions of Triple-i Initiative will go live on Steam, Epic Games Store, Humble and elsewhere on the same day as the showcase.

    "description": "Anker devices make up some of our top picks for the best power banks on the market , and the company debuted a few new ones at CES this year. Those included Anker&#39;s Laptop Power Bank , a 25,000mAh portable charger with three 100W USB-C ports and a single USB connector. That new device is down to the best price we&#39;ve seen since launch as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale — just $88, which represents a 20-percent discount from its original price. The new power bank , available in Black and Silver, comes with two USB-C cables and can charge four devices simultaneously. It works with laptops, smartphones, cameras, gaming consoles and more. For example, it can charge an MacBook Air with an M3 chip to 50 percent in 33 minutes. It can also get an iPhone 16 to the same level in just 25 minutes. Plus, its display shows the battery&#39;s health and temperature, along with output and input wattage.&nbsp; Anker&#39;s 140W four-port wall charger is also discounted for Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale. You can pick it up right now for $77, down from $90. It offers a display that tracks power usage for each port, fast-charge status and temperature. Plus, it has something Anker refers to as an &quot; odometer ,&quot; tracking lifetime usage hour by hour.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ankers-latest-chargers-and-power-banks-are-up-to-20-percent-off-in-the-amazon-spring-sale-130131799.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Levoit LVAC-200 cordless vacuum has been discounted to $150 as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . That’s 25 percent off and close to a record-low price. The sale only applies to the standard white model and not the blue one. The LVAC-200 made our list of the best cordless vacuums . We loved the lightweight design. It only weighs three pounds and it can easily be disassembled for storage. Just pop the cleaning head from the extension arm and the arm from the motor base. It also features a locking mechanism, so it can stand upright between cleaning sessions. The cleaning power here is more than sufficient. We found that it did a good job with &quot;all kinds of dry messes.&quot; It has three suction modes, so it can handle both hard and carpeted floors. It can even suck up pet hair, which is the true test of any vacuum. The design allows for the vacuum to easily reach underneath couches and beds, which is a fantastic bonus. On the downside, the dustbin is pretty small, at just 0.75 liters. We found during our testing that the bin could fill up with just one full cleaning session. The vacuum also includes a five-stage filtration system, but it doesn’t include a true HEPA filter.

    "description": "GeoGuessr, the geography game that tasks players with guessing a location in the world based on a random Google Street View image, is coming to Steam . It’s slated to hit early access on the platform sometime in April. That should hopefully make the game much easier to access on Steam Deck without having to fiddle with browser settings on desktop mode. The developers are taking the early access approach on Steam so they can &quot;refine the gameplay, introduce new features and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players&quot; with the aim of making &quot;the ultimate competitive and casual geography game.&quot; The early access version on Steam will at the very least have a competitive solo mode and casual Team Duels, though there are plans to add more modes and competitive features in the coming months. GeoGuessr has a fairly thriving competitive scene — this year&#39;s world championship has a $100,000 prize pool — so you could stand to cash in if you become great at the game. But be warned: if you think pro GeoGuessr might be your calling, you&#39;ll be up against some incredibly skilled players. They can pinpoint parts of the world based on corn growing at the side of a road , clouds in the sky and room decor . GeoGuessr pros are absolutely absurd. It&#39;s not clear how much the full Steam version will cost. A free version will include unlimited access to the amateur division, which is GeoGuessr&#39;s lowest rank, as well as unranked Team Duels. A Steam Pass that&#39;s available to purchase inside the game will be required to access the full Solo Duels mode. The store page notes that the price won&#39;t change during the time the game is in early access (a period that&#39;s expected to be at least six months). Nor do the developers expect to increase the price when the game exits early access. The original, 12-year-old web version allows players to make three free daily guesses, but to play more you have to pay for a subscription, which starts at $2.50 per month. Unlimited access on the mobile apps is available on the $3 per month Pro Unlimited plan. While there will be cross-play between Steam and the browser/mobile versions, the current GeoGuessr plans don&#39;t include full access to the Steam edition.

Not only is that a $15 discount, but its only a couple of dollars more than the record-low price we&#39;ve tracked. Amazon released the Fire TV Stick HD last October and, soon after, it became the top budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices . It&#39;s a basic stre2amer that received a couple of much-needed updates when Amazon revamped its Fire TV devices last year. The Fire TV Stick HD has HDR support and streams with full HD resolution. It also comes with an Alexa-powered remote control, which lets you search for titles with just a click of the Alexa button. That remote also has Netflix and Prime Video buttons, but the device can run most streaming apps, like Disney+ and Peacock.&nbsp; Elsewhere in the Fire TV lineup, you can grab the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for only $40 thanks to Amazon Spring Sale deals. This is the most powerful streaming dongle Amazon makes, with support for 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos, Wi-Fi 6E and Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass gaming.

    "description": "It turns out Nintendo Directs are like buses. You wait ages for one then get two in quick succession. Days before Nintendo fully spills the beans on the Switch 2 during a dedicated showcase on April 2 , the company is hosting a surprise Direct on March 27 at 10AM ET. You can watch it above. The stream will run for around 30 minutes and focus on upcoming Switch games. There won&#39;t be any Switch 2 info, but pretty much every game you see here will run on the new console anyway, thanks to backwards compatibility . Since this isn&#39;t billed as an Indie World Direct (those focus on indie games), it&#39;s not really clear what we can expect from this one. Nintendo&#39;s developers will largely be focused on making Switch 2 games at this point. Still, the Switch has a massive install base — the company has sold more than 150 million of those consoles — so Nintendo probably won&#39;t want to leave all those players behind any time soon.&nbsp; To that end, we can expect a stream of games for the original Switch to keep coming for the foreseeable future. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond , for instance, is still slated to hit the Switch sometime this year . Third-party games will still be coming to the Switch as well, including a certain one from Team Cherry that we expect to show up in every single gaming showcase but won&#39;t mention here because we don&#39;t want to jinx it.

Right now, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 earbuds are down to $45 from $80 — a 44 percent discount. That&#39;s an incredible price for earbuds with active noise cancellation.&nbsp; The $45 deal on our favorite budget wireless earbuds is available for the Black and Blue models, while the White, Green and Purple options are slightly more expensive at $50. However, the latter two typically retail for $100 , so they&#39;re actually half off with the current sale.&nbsp; As mentioned above, one of the great things about Anker&#39;s Soundcore Space A40 earbuds is that they offer ANC. Anker claims that using it can reduce potential noise by 98 percent. The earbuds also hold up to 10 hours of battery and up to 50 hours with the charging case.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/napster-just-sold-for-207-million-154432315.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The once-iconic music-sharing platform Napster was just purchased for $207 million, with a company called Infinite Reality picking up the tab. What could Napster offer in 2025 to warrant such a price tag? Infinite Reality says it&#39;ll be used as a &quot;social music platform that prioritizes active fan engagement&quot; with a focus on giving artists a platform they can use to connect with listeners and, of course, make more money from them. More specifically, the company plans on creating virtual 3D spaces for music fans to attend concerts and listening parties, in addition to creating a sales platform for musicians and labels to sell merch. This isn’t the worst idea in the world, as attending these kinds of shared events is probably my favorite aspect of VR. It&#39;s not clear what will happen with the existing Napster service; for now, it doesn&#39;t appear it&#39;ll go away immediately. While it offers a similarly massive catalog to what you&#39;ll find on industry leaders Spotify and Apple Music as well as others, the service isn&#39;t really top-of-mind anymore.&nbsp; &quot;The most legendary collab?! Infinite Reality has acquired iconic online music brand @Napster . With this acquisition, we&#39;re expanding and reimagining Napster, empowering artists with new audience monetization and engagement capabilities, underpinned by iR’s #immersive … pic.twitter.com/L4Fig7QFct — Infinite Reality (@Infinite_iR) March 25, 2025 “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” Acunto said. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.” Napster holds numerous licenses to stream millions of songs, which is what made it an attractive prospect to Infinite Reality. The company says its version of Napster will “disrupt legally.” Current Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos says that the purchase will allow artists to create “crazy environments that are really only limited by their imaginations.” As an example, he described a reggae artist who might enjoy a virtual beach environment. Acunto adds that it’ll be like “Clubhouse times a trillion.” He’s referring to the virtual events app that became popular during COVID , but eventually petered out. Infinite Reality has been on a buying spree the last couple of years. In addition to Napster, it purchased the Drone Racing League , the metaverse marketing platform Landvault and the VR shopping platform Obsess . As for Napster, it started in 1999 and took the world by storm, creating an easy-peasy way to steal music. It only took a couple of years for mounting legal battles to catch up to the platform and it declared bankruptcy in 2001. However, that was just the beginning . The software company Roxio purchased the platform in 2002 and relaunched it as a legitimate e-commerce venture that sold digital music files. In 2008, Best Buy came calling and scooped it up. The retail giant only held on to Napster for a few years before selling to Rhapsody in 2011 . Rhapsody tried to make Napster a household name in Europe for the next decade before a consortium of blockchain companies, led by Hivemind and Algorand, bought it in 2022 . These companies had plans to do some kind of NFT-based nonsense, because “music x web3 is one of the most exciting spaces.” That didn’t work and, well, here we are. Here’s to another 25 years of being passed around like a hot potato. Update, March 26 2025, 10:43AM ET: This story was updated with more details about Infinite Reality&#39;s plans for Napster.

    "description": "As someone who paid full price for Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM5 headphones , I am jealous to report that they are 20 percent off right now as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . Yes, our choice for 2025&#39;s best wireless headphones have dropped to $318 from $400 — a 20 percent discount. They briefly dropped to $250 earlier in the sale, but have since jumped back up a bit. Nevertheless, this is a good sale price overall; you can grab them on discount in either the silver of smoky pink colors. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones are one of them. I&#39;ve raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they&#39;re so comfortable. I&#39;ve worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp; Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they&#39;re a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don&#39;t have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp; Their excellence on flights isn&#39;t the only reason we gave Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones a 95 in our review . They&#39;re also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound&#39;s quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don&#39;t fold up, but especially at this price, they&#39;re still such a great buy.&nbsp; This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don&#39;t quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

    "description": "Microsoft has launched two new &quot;reasoning agents&quot; for Copilot that were designed to analyze vast amounts of work data, including emails, meetings, chats and documents. The first tool called &quot;Researcher&quot; is based on OpenAI&#39;s deep research model combined with Copilot&#39;s advanced orchestration and deep search capabilities. Researcher was made for &quot;complex, multi-step research&quot; at work. It can take a user&#39;s internal work data along with additional information from the web, such as competitive data, emerging trends and the latest market analysis, to create market strategies and comprehensive quarterly reports, among other potential uses. Plus, it can pull data from Salesforce, ServiceNow and other external sources. Meanwhile, the new &quot;Analyst&quot; tool was built to function like a skilled data scientist. It&#39;s based on OpenAI&#39;s o3-mini reasoning model and uses &quot;chain-of-thought reasoning&quot; to solve issues in multiple steps to provide answers that Microsoft says &quot;mirror human analytical thinking.&quot; It can process raw data across multiple spreadsheets to, say, predict future revenue and expenses, forecast demand for a new product and visualize the purchasing patterns of customers. For the most complex data queries, it can run Python, and users will be able to view the code while it&#39;s running in real time.&nbsp; Both Researcher and Analyst will be rolling out to customers with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license starting in April as part of &quot;Frontier.&quot; Customers enrolled to the new Frontier program will get access to Copilot technologies while they&#39;re still in development, starting with these two new tools.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-deep-research-and-analysis-tools-for-copilot-143001894.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Noble Audio FoKus Apollo review: The high price of pristine audio",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html?src=rss",
    "description": "I don’t review a lot of $650 headphones . That’s because most audio companies sell their top-of-the-line gear around $300-$400. Noble Audio isn’t like most companies. The FoKus Rex5 earbuds, for example, cram in five separate drivers where much of the competition uses two at the most. Noble was also among the first to employ xMEMS drivers in wireless earbuds in a bid to improve bass performance. Enter the FoKus Apollo , a $649 pair of active noise canceling (ANC) headphones with a detachable boom mic and up to 80 hours of battery life. The real star of the show is the driver setup , which Noble says is the first time this configuration appears in wireless headphones. The company is once again on a quest for the absolute best sound quality, but it may sacrifice a little too much along the way. Sound quality is the main attraction Noble Audio’s proposition is simple: the “world’s first” headphones that offer a hybrid speaker pairing of a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar magnetic driver. A dynamic driver is nothing new for a set of cans, but adding the latter makes the FoKus Apollo’s audio setup unique. For the uninitiated, planar magnetic drivers have a thin, flat diaphragm that typically offers a wider, more immersive soundstage and enhanced detail compared to dynamic drivers. Planar magnetic drivers are typically reserved for audiophile-grade headphones since they’re larger and more fragile. With the FoKus Apollo, Noble capitalized on the best of both worlds for the stock tuning. You get the bass power of a dynamic driver with the clarity of a planar magnetic driver. Since planar magnetic units can’t move enough air for the robust bass that most of us crave, and as dynamic drivers are limited with mid- and high-range details, the company argues it has created the optimal solution. From the first second of the first song, I could tell the FoKus Apollo was built differently. The addition of planar magnetic drivers offers the most bass-heavy genres an almost absurd amount of detail. Albums like Spiritbox’s Tsunami Sea that lack clarity on other headphones greatly benefit from the treble boost, serving up more nuance in the guitar riffs and texture in the kick drum blasts. The FoKus Apollo also excels with mellow styles, allowing you to hear every bit of sound coming from the acoustic guitars, banjo, bass and more on Julien Baker &amp; TORRES’ “Sugar in the Tank.” Going from most over-ear headphones to the FoKus Apollo is like going from standard music streaming to vinyl. And I don’t think that’s hyperbole. FoKus Apollo in-use: ANC, battery life and more Billy Steele for Engadget A pair of $649 ANC headphones better damn well provide some decent noise cancellation, even if you’re primarily buying them for the audio performance. Noble opted for a hybrid ANC setup with three microphones on each side and a Qualcomm QCC3084 chip. That processor provides the necessary digital signal processing (DSP) and algorithms to reduce background distractions. Like a lot of ANC headphones, the FoKus Apollo struggles with voices. That means any hopes of silencing a chatty colleague won’t pan out. However, the headphones do a solid job with constant noise sources — fans, appliances, noise machines, etc. — so they do offer some relief. The noise-blocking prowess isn’t as good as the likes of Bose , but I found ample room to focus during my test sessions. While the ANC here isn’t among the best, it’s perfectly serviceable in most environments. Noble promises a whopping 60 hours of battery life with ANC enabled, with another 20 hours of use if you turn it off. I found that those figures hold true during my time with the FoKus Apollo. After 30 hours of music, podcasts and work calls with noise cancellation active, the headphones still had 57 percent battery remaining — tracking slightly better than the company’s stated numbers. The Fokus Apollo comes with all the accessories you’d ever need right in the box. Noble includes a detachable boom mic, 3.5mm to 4.4mm adapter, two-prong airline adapter, USB-C cable and 3.5mm aux cable. The headphones can be used with either of those two cords, and the company recommends you do so when employing the microphone for optimal voice quality. If you’re planning to use the Fokus Apollo for calls, you can expect mixed results. In quiet spaces with little echo, you’ll sound good enough for a professional presentation. When you move to a room with some natural reverb, the mics on these headphones pick that up a little too well. What’s more, they’re not great at blocking background sounds, as fans, white noise machines and raucous appliances were all clearly heard on the other end during my tests. Design that matches the sound The FoKus Apollo is really expensive, so Noble couldn’t just give us a set of headphones built mostly out of plastic and call it a day. Thankfully, the company chose a mix of anodized aluminum, premium protein leather and a soft Alcantara headband. The leather-wrapped memory foam ear pads are replaceable, which will extend the life of the headphones under heavy use. There’s also a nice textured cloth pattern on the outside of the ear cups and headband that provide both tactile and visual contrast. Noble Audio provides physical controls on the FoKus Apollo, so you’ll never have to struggle with tap or touch gestures to make changes. On the right side, there’s a dedicated button for ANC modes (on, off and transparency) with a three-control array just below it. Here, the top and bottom buttons handle the volume and track adjustments while the center one is used for power, Bluetooth pairing, play/pause and to summon Google Assistant, Siri or some other virtual helper. On the left ear cup, a single slider allows you to mute all the microphones, even the boom when it’s attached, without reaching for your phone or keyboard. The lack of advanced features Billy Steele for Engadget The FoKus Apollo is really only focused on the basics, so it doesn’t offer any of today’s advanced features. Heck, there aren’t even tools that have been on other sets for years — like wear detection. Although you’ll get support for Sony’s LDAC codec along with AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC, there’s no mention of Dolby Atmos or any form of spatial audio. You don’t find any discussion of adaptive audio or adaptive ANC that makes automatic adjustments to both overall sound and noise cancellation either. Look, I’m well aware the premise here is pristine sound quality above all else. But at $649, which is $100 more than the AirPods Max by the way, I expect some degree of convenience that allows me to keep these headphones on for most of the day. Automatic pausing or wear detection should be standard at this price and it would be nice to have some additional sound/ANC options. I’m not picky about whether those are the automatic, adaptive type, or whether they’re settings I have to toggle on in the app. Just, please, give me something more than EQ adjustments when your sound out of the box is already incredible. The competition Once you hit $500 and above, you’ve surpassed what most companies charge for their flagship-level wireless headphones. You’re also in a price range where I’ve only reviewed a handful of models. If money is no object, the $699 Px8 from Bowers &amp; Wilkins delivers excellent sound quality in a design that might be preferable to some folks (there’s at least multiple color options). Its ANC performance isn’t earth shattering either, and one of my biggest gripes with the company’s products is the lack of advanced features like the FoKus Apollo. There’s also the AirPods Max and Dyson On-Trac , but neither of those are easy to recommend. Apple’s over-ear headphones have barely been updated since they arrived in 2020, except for an upgrade to USB-C and the upcoming addition of lossless audio . Dyson’s headphones have long battery life and a unique design, but they didn’t impress me sound-wise, have average ANC performance and lack the modern features I expect for $500. I also need to mention Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW75 in the over-$500 discussion. If you’re after high-end looks, no other company consistently nails its trademark aesthetic like M&amp;D. True to its lineage, the company pairs leather and metal on these headphones, along with tempered glass panels on the outside of the earcups. I’ve always enjoyed the balance of M&amp;D’s stock tuning and the ANC performance is solid. You won’t get any advanced features here either, but like the Px8, there are multiple color options if you’re after something other than Noble’s black and silver paint scheme. Wrap-up I have no doubts there are a lot of people that will thoroughly enjoy the FoKus Apollo . If you crave the absolute best sound quality on the market, these headphones are the best I’ve tested in that regard. For me, to pay $649 I expect more in terms of features. The first item would be better ANC performance, but I don’t feel like spatial audio support and wear detection are too much to ask. Even without any of that, you do get a novel driver setup that produces some ridiculously detailed sound across diverse genres.

    "title": "iPad (2025) with A16 review: No Apple Intelligence, no problem",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html?src=rss",
    "description": "When it debuted in 2022, Apple’s 10th-generation iPad sat in something of a no-man’s land, bringing a long-overdue design revamp at an inflated price. A year and a half later, Apple gave the slate a $100 price cut and immediately turned it into a much more enticing value . Now, the company has quietly released a follow-up. Dubbed the iPad (A16) , the new tablet is a far less dramatic update, one with welcome performance improvements that otherwise refuses to rock the boat. It even lacks the Apple Intelligence features Apple has endlessly promoted over the past year. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Compared to the iPad Air, iPad Pro and iPad mini, this might be the easiest Apple tablet to grok — it’s the cheapest, it only comes in one size and it’s clearly designed for the core iPad Things. That doesn’t make it a slam dunk, though. What hasn’t changed Almost everything about the latest iPad is identical to the previous entry-level iPad from 2022, which brought many of the iPad Air’s features down to a lower price. The design is unchanged, with the same dimensions, weight, bezels, display and aluminum finish as before. Apple now lists the screen as being 11 inches instead of 10.9 inches, but it’s merely rounding up for marketing purposes — the size is no different. There are still competent 12-megapixel cameras on the front and back, with the selfie cam conveniently located along the device’s long edge for FaceTime calls. The same reliable Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the power button in lieu of Face ID. Two speakers, one on either end, sit behind a (misleading) quartet of grilles, while a lone USB-C port continues to max out at basic USB 2.0 transfer speeds. There’s no difference in accessory support either, and the whole thing is available in the same bold colors: blue, pink, yellow or silver. Battery life, meanwhile, still checks in at around 10 hours per charge, give or take a few depending on how you push it. I got 11 hours and 19 minutes out of the slate after playing a 1080p movie on loop at roughly 70 percent brightness and volume (and with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth disabled). Gaming and media editing will naturally sap it faster. Most of this is still perfectly fine for a $349 tablet. The last iPad was a light and comfortable slab, with a substantial aluminum finish and flat sides that made it feel modern. This one is no different. And iPadOS is still a level above Android and Windows tablets when it comes to app and game support, long-term updates and features optimized for large displays. But if the 10th-gen iPad was a “tick” update, the iPad (A16) is clearly a “tock.” That said, there are some important changes, namely a faster chip, more memory and higher storage options, plus a few minor tweaks like Smart HDR 4 processing for photos and support for Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.2. It’s a spec bump through and through, with most of those tweaks being for the better, although I do think that some of the things that haven’t been touched could really use an update next time. A faster chip and more RAM As the name implies, the latest iPad’s headline upgrade is its A16 chip. This is a slightly weaker version of the A16 Bionic found in 2022’s iPhone 14 Pro and the regular iPhone 15 from 2023. Compared to that SoC, this A16 has five CPU cores instead of six and four GPU cores instead of five. But in practice, it’s still more than fast enough for the vast majority of things people do with iPads: browsing the web, streaming video, reading ebooks, viewing and editing photos, playing most games and the like. I tested this iPad against my personal 13-inch iPad Air M2 for much of this review, and the two consistently booted up and loaded popular apps at virtually the same speed. The few times the Air M2 was quicker, the difference wasn’t long enough to be significant. Geekbench 6 results back this up: The iPad (A16) earned a single-core CPU score of 2,582, while the iPad Air M2 was only marginally better at 2,632. This is a roughly 20 percent jump from the 10th-gen iPad, though the most recent iPad Air M3 still measures about 16-18 percent faster. But for media consumption and common work tasks, it won’t feel slow anytime soon. These performance gains are helped by the 6GB of RAM, which is 2GB more than the last model and twice as much as the 9th-gen iPad from 2021. While this is still 2GB short of the iPad Air and lower-spec iPad Pros, getting more memory for the same price is always a good thing: It lets the tablet hang onto apps and Safari tabs longer before it has to start refreshing things for new tasks. It will only improve the chances of the device holding up four or five years down the road, too. Where the iPad (A16) lags behind its higher-end siblings is multi-core and graphics performance. In Geekbench 6, the tablet’s multi-core CPU score was about 40 percent below the iPad Air M2 (6,185 vs. 10,006), while its GPU score was about 55 percent worse (19,448 vs. 42,920). Other graphics benchmarks were largely the same: It scored about 60 percent lower than the Air M2 in 3DMark’s Wild Life Extreme test (with an average of 15.2 fps vs. 37.6 fps) and anywhere between 45 to 55 percent worse on GFXBench ’s Aztec Ruins benchmark, depending on the resolution. Of course, the difference will be a little greater with the newer iPad Air M3. This sounds more dramatic on paper than it does in real life. Many everyday iPad workloads won’t tax the chip’s multi-core abilities all that hard, and the scores above are still a good 15 to 30 percent higher than the last entry-level iPad. I could still play Call of Duty Mobile at its highest settings (120 fps mode aside) without any hitches. Diablo Immortal warned that maxing out its settings would put the device under “high” load — with the Air M2, it only goes up to “medium” load — but I still got through the opening areas totally fine. (It does seem to drain the battery a bit faster, though.) You can still edit RAW photos in Lightroom or create music in GarageBand without major frustration. The iPad (A16) on top of a 13-inch iPad Air. Still, the Air is better if you ever want to push things further. This is easiest to see in the newest and most taxing iPadOS games. With Infinity Nikki , for instance, playing at ultra or high settings on the new iPad brought a constant bit of choppiness and some slowdowns during more involved animations. It also warmed up the device’s back and drained the battery faster. The game was still totally playable at medium settings, but there’s less need to knock it down on the iPad Air M2, where it looked sharper and ran smoother at high settings. Likewise, the Air will be noticeably quicker to export higher-res videos in apps like Adobe Premiere Rush. Arguably, the main benefit of the iPad Air’s M-series chip and extra RAM has less to do with today than it does the future. Features like Apple Intelligence and the Stage Manager multitasking mode aren’t available here, nor are some especially demanding games . Those aren’t essential right now — though omitting Stage Manager does make the device more cumbersome to use with an external display — but there’ll always be some risk that the next great iPadOS feature or power-hungry game won’t work (or work as well ) with this entry-level model. More storage — hallelujah The best improvement with the iPad (A16) is also the simplest: It now starts with 128GB of storage, which is twice as much as the last model. There’s also a new 512GB option for $649. There isn’t much to say about this besides “good.” It’s a common-sense upgrade that makes the tablet a much safer long-term investment than its predecessor, especially when there’s no hope of Apple ever letting us upgrade storage manually. A fine display, but it’s time to improve In his iPad Air M3 review , my colleague Nathan Ingraham argued that it’s time for Apple to update the Air’s display with a higher refresh rate or a mini LED panel , as the OLED tech exclusive to the iPad Pros represents a major upgrade on its own. Since the iPad (A16)’s screen is no different than the last one, I want to make a follow-up case for the entry-level model, albeit on a smaller scale. It&#39;s much easier to see in person than through photos, but if you look at the bottom corner of the display, near the bezel, you can see the air gap between the iPad&#39;s LCD panel and front glass. Out of context, the IPS display here is still totally adequate. It’s comfortably sized, it’s sharp enough, it’s not a massive smudge magnet and it doesn’t have any serious color accuracy issues. A tablet is nothing if not a big display, and most of the people Apple is targeting with this one will still enjoy watching and reading stuff on it. I can also live with the 60Hz refresh rate — that’s the minimum in 2025, but it’s a harsher limitation on a $599 ( or $799 ) tablet like the iPad Air than a $349 device. The other restrictions are more annoying. This screen still isn’t laminated, most notably, which means there’s a visible air gap between the LCD panel and the glass above. This helps the screen’s repairability but makes it look cheaper and feel more distant when you interact with the glass. This is particularly discernible with the Apple Pencil: Writing out notes on the iPad Air is both quieter and more natural. Those who’ve never used a higher-end iPad probably won’t care, but once you notice the difference, you can’t unsee it. The display also lacks an anti-reflective coating, so it’s worse at fending off glare. It’s certainly not unusable outdoors, but you’ll see your reflection much more clearly on the iPad (A16) than you will on the iPad Air M2 in sunlight. You’re much more likely to have to angle its display to make things out. Unlike the iPad Air and iPad Pro, the base iPad isn’t tuned for the wider P3 color space either. While the difference in color reproduction between the iPad Air and iPad (A16) is nowhere near as dramatic as the one between the Air and the iPad Pro, colors on the Air can still look slightly bolder and less washed-out when you put the two side-by-side. I appreciate that Apple wants to keep its “good, better, best” hierarchy intact, but at this point the iPad Pro’s display is so far ahead of the rest of the lineup that there’s room to even things out. If the next Air can upgrade to 120Hz, as Nathan suggests, then the next entry-level iPad should at least have a laminated display with better glare protection. Those aren’t premium features anymore. The USB-C Pencil can attach magnetically but lacks wireless charging and pressure sensitivity, so it&#39;s not a great choice for more involved work. Continued weirdness with accessories Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard support is another ongoing pain point. Like its predecessor, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with the Pencil Pro (Apple’s best stylus) or the older, second-gen Pencil. That means the only stylus you can buy with pressure sensitivity — a key feature for digital artists that lets you make darker marks by pressing down harder — is the original Pencil, which is nearly a decade old (!), isn’t as comfortable as the newer models and can’t attach to the tablet magnetically. It also requires a USB-C cable and a USB-C to Lightning adapter to charge. All of this is bad . You can still get the $79 USB-C Pencil , which is nicer to hold and can attach to the iPad’s side magnetically but isn’t pressure-sensitive and still requires a separate cable to pair and charge. Really, though, most people who want an iPad for drawing should start with the iPad Air. I’ve never been a big fan of this iPad’s Magic Keyboard Folio either, as its Surface-style kickstand is hard to keep stable on your lap and it lacks backlit keys. That’s tough given its exorbitantly high price of $249. Not built for Apple Intelligence, but that’s OK (for now) As noted above, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with Apple Intelligence, which is Apple’s catch-all term for the suite of generative AI features it’s gradually rolled out since late last year. In fact, it’s the only major device Apple has released without the AI tools since they became available. Right now, though, you won’t miss much without them. Sure, the “ Clean Up ” feature that lets you scrub unwanted objects from photos is nice. Some of the writing-assistance tools are fine if you’re completely out of gas, and being able to access ChatGPT through Siri is convenient. But just as many of the tricks are either half-cooked or, let’s say, less than essential . A promised Siri revamp has been significantly delayed . If anything, many people will appreciate that their tablet won’t push AI onto them with every update. There’s always a chance Apple Intelligence becomes more useful down the road, and buying the iPad (A16) means locking yourself out of that potential future. But it’s not there yet , and Apple is reportedly well aware of that, so we can’t call it a major omission today. Wrap-up The iPad (A16) isn’t a massive leap forward from the last entry-level iPad, and some of its display and accessory quirks are getting long in the tooth. We still recommend stepping up to the iPad Air if you can swing it: It’s faster and more futureproof, with small but meaningful upgrades to the screen, better accessory support and speakers that sound less compressed. It’s also worth the upgrade if you want to use your iPad as a pseudo laptop replacement without spending top dollar. If you see a great deal on refurbished iPad Air M2 , that’s a good buy as well. But for $250 less than the latest Air, the iPad (A16) does well to meet most iPad users where they live. It’s largely well-built and plenty quick for reading, watching and playing things, with solid battery life and an eternally easy-to-use OS. If you’re upgrading from a 9th-gen iPad or older, buying for a kid or just looking for a competent slate you won’t use for hours every day, it should be plenty of tablet for your needs. It’s not the most delightful iPad, but it’s good enough for the masses.

    "description": "Block has laid off 931 workers, which make up around eight percent of its entire staff, according to TechCrunch and The Guardian . The publications have viewed an email, wherein the financial technology company&#39;s co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, has discussed the latest organizational changes. Dorsey said that Block is eliminating roles based on three areas, starting with strategy. The company is letting 391 people go, because it&#39;s reducing &quot;teams that are off strategy.&quot; It&#39;s also parting ways with 460 workers who scored a &quot;below&quot; rating or are trending towards a &quot;below&quot; rating in its internal performance tracking metrics. Finally, Block is laying off 80 managers, as well as moving 193 to individual contributor roles, to flatten the organization and remove layers of middle management between workers and the high-level bosses they&#39;d now have to report to. In his email, Dorsey denied that the layoffs were made to hit any specific financial target and headcount goal, or because the company was replacing workers with artificial intelligence. He said that it was all about strategy and because flattening its org will allow it to &quot;move faster and with less abstraction.&quot; The CEO admitted, however, that everyone in Block has equity in the company and that the reorganization &quot;will help [it] focus and execute better to do just that.&quot; Block&#39;s stock prices have plummeted by around 30 percent this year.&nbsp; Dorsey explained that the company is laying off nearly 1,000 workers all at once instead of over time, because it&#39;s behind in its actions. &quot;We need to move to help us meet and stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in,&quot; he wrote. In addition to the layoffs, Block is also closing 748 previously open jobs and is only leaving key leadership and critical roles, along with those that have already progressed to offer stage, open. Block, which owns Square and Cash App, also underwent a reorganization in early 2024. It laid off nearly 1,000 people back then, as well, to make the company leaner and to limit its headcount to around 12,000 workers. As TechCrunch notes, Block had around 11,300 workers around the world by December 2024, which means its headcount is now far below the original goal it set for itself in 2023.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/block-reportedly-lays-off-almost-1000-employees-130056952.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best language learning apps for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-language-learning-app-120001600.html?src=rss",
    "description": "There’s a good chance learning a new language is one of your New Year’s resolutions, unless you’re hoping Google Translate will be enough for your next international adventure. Either way, you’ll need a reliable method to guide you through speaking and understanding the foreign language of your choosing. Fortunately, we're no longer confined to flashcards and textbooks as you can learn using your phone from the comfort of your couch. Many of the best language learning apps today offer a multi-tier approach, with AI-powered conversations, extensive vocab libraries and even podcasts you can listen to to help you master your target language. Whether you're just starting because you're just trying to understand what Bad Bunny means when he says \"un verano en Nueva Yol ,\" or you want to brush up on your Korean before that planned vacation, there’s a language learning app to suit your needs. Best language learning apps for 2025 Others language learning apps we tested Memrise Memrise has a library of more than 200 languages to learn. From Spanish to isiXhosa, Memrise can teach you all the basics and dive into more regional differences. As a Spanish learner, I could choose to learn from Spain or Mexico and I enjoyed that Memrise didn’t just teach me a more generalized version of the language. While Memrise could be great for polyglots, its hefty $60 monthly fee was too steep and prevented it from gleaning one of our top slots. Pimsleur Dr. Pimsleur believed speaking and listening were key to learning a new language. This app allows you to take its audio lessons offline, even going as far as integrating into Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. As a commuter, I appreciated having a lesson or two stored away for my journey to the office. However, I wanted more ways to practice reading and writing. With other apps offering podcasts for listening along and other forms of teaching, Pimsleur didn’t offer enough to make our list. Rosetta Stone Gone are the large, yellow disc sets of yesteryear; now Rosetta Stone lives squarely in the digital age with its app. Using the same visual learning tools as the old-school Rosetta Stone, the app shows you pictures and terms to get you to understand what things mean. Users can repeat after voice recordings and match phrases to the images to learn slowly. Rosetta Stone could be great for beginners, but in order to get access to all 25 languages and a lifetime subscription, you’d have to dish out $400. There are cheaper apps on this list that provide comparable experiences. HelloTalk Similar to Discord, HelloTalk provides voice and chat rooms to talk to folks from different countries. Its users can learn regional terms and talk about cultural differences. With a paid subscription, you can practice with a tutor or their AI chatbot. If you’re looking to learn a new language outside of your inner circle, HelloTalk can be a great fit. I enjoyed connecting with others on the app, but, as always when meeting strangers online, beware — some users treat it like a dating app. Fortunately, there are apps on this list that offer a similar AI learning approach without that added concern. How we test language learning apps As an intermediate Spanish learner, I was looking for an app that best catered to my needs, but I know everyone learns differently. So for each app, I assessed based on several factors. Can beginners use this to gain confidence? Will advanced speakers feel challenged? Are there enough opportunities to test reading and writing skills? How many ways can you learn vocabulary words? For those who want to have more conversations, what opportunities did each app provide to speak in that language? Bonus points if an app helped you learn a bit of the culture surrounding that language.

    "title": "The best headphones for running in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Whether you’re already an avid runner or hope to be one as you start a new training regimen, you’ll get more out of your exercise routine if you have some good music to accompany you. Getting into the zone during a long run with your preferred music, be it rap, classic rock or today’s pop hits, can totally change your experience for the better. To do that, you have to start with a good pair of running headphones. But not all wireless workout headphones are created equally, and runners need to consider specific factors before investing in a pair like how long your runs are, what type of music or other audio you prefer listening to and how much you want to block out the world during a session. I’ve tested out more than a dozen pairs to find which are the best headphones for running for all budgets and all kinds of runners. Table of contents Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones How we test headphones for running Others headphones for running we tested Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones Design Before diving in, it’s worth mentioning that this guide focuses on wireless earbuds . While you could wear over-ear or on-ear Bluetooth headphones during a run, most of the best headphones available now do not have the same level of durability. Water and dust resistance, particularly the former, is important for any audio gear you plan on sweating with or taking outdoors, and that’s more prevalent in the wireless earbuds world. Most earbuds have one of three designs: in-ear, in-ear with hook or open-ear. The first two are the most popular. In-ears are arguably the most common, while those with hooks promise better security and fit since they have an appendage that curls around the top of your ear. Open-ear designs don’t stick into your ear canal, but rather sit just outside of it. This makes it easier to hear the world around you while also listening to audio, and could be more comfortable for those who don’t like the intrusiveness of in-ear buds. Water resistance and dust protection Water resistance and dust protection are crucial for the best running headphones to have since you’ll likely be sweating while wearing them. Also, if you have the unfortunate luck of getting caught in the rain during a run, at least your gear will survive. Here’s a quick rundown of ingress protection (IP) ratings, which you’ll see attached to many earbuds on the market today. The first digit after the abbreviation rates dust protection on a scale from one to six — the higher, the better. The second digit refers to water- resistance, or waterproofing in some cases, ranked on a scale from one to nine. A letter “X” in either position means the device isn’t rated for the corresponding material. Check out this guide for an even more detailed breakdown. All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating (most have even more protection), which means they can withstand sweat and splashes but do not have dust protection. Active noise cancellation and transparency mode Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming a standard feature on wireless earbuds, at least in those above a certain price. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and continue to serve you when you’re off the trail, ANC is good to have. It adds versatility by allowing you to block out the hum of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute on public transit. But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand in hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many earbuds with ANC support some sort of “transparency mode” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for running headphones because you don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re exercising outside along busy streets. Lowering noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that. Battery life All of the earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most runners, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session. Speaking of, you’ll get an average of 20-28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a wireless charger to power up. How we test headphones for running When testing to determine the best running headphones, I wear each contender during as many runs as possible. I typically run three to five days each week, completing at least a 5K (3.01 miles) each time. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you’re on the tread or trail (as a note, I primarily run outside). I’m also paying attention to fit over time, particularly if the earbuds get slippery or loose while I sweat, or if they tend to pop out or feel less stable in my ears as I pick up speed or make quick movements. I also use the earbuds when not running to take calls and listen to music, podcasts and the like throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities. While I am also listening for audio quality, I’m admittedly not an expert in this space. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about sound quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and buying guides . Here, however, I will make note of audio-quality characteristics if they stood out to me (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’re able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases. A note about Jabra headphones Jabra announced that it will exit the consumer earbuds business , which is disappointing considering the company has made excellent headphones for running (and all other types of exercise). Our top picks include two Jabra models and we feel comfortable recommending them still because Jabra plans to support its current earbuds for &quot;several years.&quot; However, we&#39;re constantly testing new buds and reassessing our top picks, so we&#39;ll update this list accordingly in the future. Others headphones for running we tested Apple AirPods Pro The Apple AirPods Pro have an IP54 rating, which protects them from brief encounters with dust and splashes. While that’s more dust protection than many other earbuds we tested, it’s the same level of water-resistance that most exercise-specific competitors have. We generally like the AirPods Pro, but the Beats Fit Pro offer many of the same features and conveniences (namely good transparency mode and the H1 chip), with a design that’s more appropriate for working out. Beats Powerbeats Pro The Powerbeats Pro are a good alternative to the Beats Fit Pro if you’re a stickler for a hook design. However, they cost $50 more than the Fit Pro (although they’re often hovering around $180) and don’t offer any significant upgrades or additional features aside from their design. They’re also quite old at this point (having launched in 2019) and it appears Beats is putting more effort into updating its newer models instead. Anker Soundcore AeroFit Pro The Soundcore AeroFit Pro is Anker’s version of the Shokz OpenFit, but I found the fit to be less secure and not as comfortable. The actual earbuds on the AeroFit Pro are noticeably bulkier than those on the OpenFit and that caused them to shift and move much more during exercise. They never fell off of my ears completely, but I spent more time adjusting them than I did enjoying them. JBL Endurance Peak 3 The most noteworthy thing about the Endurance Peak 3 is that they have the same IP68 rating as the Jabra Elite 8 Active, except they only cost $100. But, while you get the same protection here, you’ll have to sacrifice in other areas. The Endurance Peak 3 didn’t blow me away when it came to sound quality or comfort (its hook is more rigid than those on my favorite similarly designed buds) and their charging case is massive compared to most competitors.

    "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on Disney+ and Hulu, Audible, Max and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in. Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This Amazon Spring Sale deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. The deal runs through April 30. Sling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange &amp; Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. Starz (six months) for $18 ($28 off): Starz&#39;s latest offer gives you six months of access for only $18, which shakes out to about $3 per month. This represents a 61-percent discount off the standard &quot;semi-annual&quot; plan, which puts six months of access up for $46. To get the offer, go to the Starz website and click on &quot;claim special offer.&quot; You&#39;ll have to provide your email address before the discounted rates appear. As an alternative, you could opt for the monthly plan discount, which is currently $3 per month for a total of three months. Paramount+ student discount - 50 percent off any plan: Ahead of March Madness , students can get half off any Paramount+ plan through April 8. To get the discount, scroll to the bottom of the Paramount+ homepage and click &quot;Get a 50% discount&quot; next to &quot;Are you a student?&quot; CBS shares broadcast rights with Warner Bros. Discovery this year for the men&#39;s tournament, so you&#39;ll be able to catch games on Paramount+ if you have the subscription tier that includes Showtime. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Fubo Essential for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, but Essential may be the best for most people. It offers access to 215 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. Note that regional sports content is not included here; you’ll have to go up to Pro or Elite plans for that. YouTube TV for $70/month for the first six months ($78 off): New subscribers can save a total of $78 when they sign up for YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Spotify student discount - Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. Hulu student discount - subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Max student discount - subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Sling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you&#39;ll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you&#39;ll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange &amp; Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+ and Hulu Duo Premium for $20/month : This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 47 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

    "description": "Gaming journalism stalwart Game Informer has risen from the ashes. More than thirty years after its debut issue back in August 1991, the media outlet was officially shut down by parent company GameStop in August 2024. Since then, the rights to Game Informer were acquired by Gunzilla Games and, in an all-to-rare win for today&#39;s media world, the entire team that worked for Game Informer at the time of its closure will return to their jobs. Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller posted the details about how the outlet was saved from the brink and noted that Gunzilla Games will be a hands-off boss. &quot;The new owners insisted on the idea of Game Informer remaining an independent editorial outlet,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They felt just as strongly as our team did that the only path forward was with an editorial group that made 100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so, without any influence from them or anyone else.&quot; “We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry,&quot; Gunzilla CEO and Co-Founder Vlad Korolov said . The website and its back catalog of content have been republished online. Game Informer &#39;s staff have also published reviews of more than two dozen games that came out during the site&#39;s hiatus and belatedly compiled their requisite best games of 2024 list. The print magazine is also expected to resume activity, and Miller said more details will be forthcoming about subscription and membership options. Gunzilla Games, which counts Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp among its leadership, made a battle royale shooter called Off the Grid and also developed the GUNZ blockchain platform.

    "description": "As it turns out, including a reporter in your national security leader group chat about military strikes isn&#39;t the only way to compromise sensitive information on Signal. NPR reported on Tuesday that, days after the Trump administration&#39;s preposterous and dangerous national security fumble , the Pentagon issued a warning against using the messaging app due to a phishing vulnerability. &quot;A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger application,&quot; a department-wide email obtained by NPR reads. &quot;Russian professional hacking groups are employing [Signal&#39;s] &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations.&quot; The publication says the memo states that Russian hacking groups are &quot;targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.&quot; A Signal spokesperson told NPR that the memo wasn&#39;t about Signal&#39;s security but about phishing attacks on the platform. So, if you&#39;re using the app, be especially mindful of attempts to trick you into linking devices to your account. Or simply communicate through different channels. The Pentagon directive follows a scandal that, at least in previous eras, would have ended the careers of a long list of high-profile officials. (In this one… who knows?) The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that a group of Trump administration national security officials inadvertently included him in a Signal group chat discussing military strikes in Yemen. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images The conversation included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, among others. They — with Goldberg essentially CC&#39;d — discussed the timing, targets and weapons involved in bombing Houthi sites in Yemen. A 2023 Department of Defense memo prohibited using mobile apps for even &quot;controlled unclassified information.&quot; NPR notes that military planning is many degrees more sensitive than that. And that doesn&#39;t even cover accidentally including a journalist in the conversation. The entire Atlantic article is worth a read, but a few gems from the chat include Hegseth&#39;s writing, &quot;I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It&#39;s PATHETIC.&quot; And, &quot;Nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.&quot; Adding to the &quot;It would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so dangerous&quot; nature of the fiasco, Hegseth went on camera to deny the chat&#39;s authenticity after the White House confirmed it. Although the fallout is still taking shape, here&#39;s an early taste. Watch below as retired US Navy captain and current US Senator Mark Kelly grills Gabbard and Ratcliffe on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

    "description": "We hear Signal is in the news . As longtime fans of the app, and secure messaging more broadly, we feel like it&#39;s our duty at Engadget to ensure you know how to use the software properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download Signal Signal is available on Android and iOS , as well as nearly every desktop operating system, including Windows and macOS. You can download the app by clicking one of the links provided above, or typing in &quot;Signal Messenger&quot; in your device&#39;s app store. Once you&#39;ve installed the app, proceed to set up an account using your phone number or an alias.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: If you want to install Signal on a workplace phone or computer, be sure to obtain approval from your employer; some organizations, such as the US government, either actively discourage or downright disallow use of the app.&nbsp; Create a new group Wonderful, you&#39;ve downloaded Signal! Now, to create a group chat, follow these steps:&nbsp; Tap the compose icon at the top of the interface.&nbsp; Select New Group. Add participants by selecting their name from your contact list, or inputting their username or phone number.&nbsp; Give your group a name (and a profile picture if you want).&nbsp; If the contents are especially sensitive, you may wish to enable Disappearing Messages and select an expiration time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#39;re in the process of adding new participants to a group, be sure to verify you&#39;re adding the right people. &nbsp; Some useful tips I would also suggest making use of Signal&#39;s Permissions feature to limit who can invite people to your chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings.&nbsp; Scroll down and select Permissions. Under &quot;Add Members,&quot; tap Only Admins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways someone can join your group chat is through a group link or QR Code . For additional security, you can set it so that admins must approve group link invites before the invitee can join.&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Scroll down and select Group Link.&nbsp; Switch the toggle to on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you know exactly who you can trust, but the guy down the hall might not! If you tend to get mixed up on names easily, Signal allows you to assign nicknames to users. After all, no one wants a case of mistaken identity. Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to assign a nickname to.&nbsp; Type in a name. You can also add a note, say describing the person&#39;s profession, in case you need additional context.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicknames are only visible to you, so don&#39;t be embarrassed to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp; How to remove someone from your group chat Look, even the best of us can make mistakes. Thankfully, Signal makes it easy to remove someone from a conversation thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to remove.&nbsp; Tap Remove From Group.&nbsp; How to delete messages in a Signal group chat So you somehow got through all of the above steps, added someone you shouldn&#39;t have and sent information that a relative stranger likely shouldn&#39;t have seen. Lets be honest, you&#39;re an edge case. But there&#39;s still hope if you caught your mistakes early.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap and hold the message on mobile (or hover the message bubble on desktop), Select Delete. Select Delete for Everyone. Now there&#39;s less chance of, for instance, a record of your civil and perhaps even criminal mishaps being shared to a notable reporter in a form potentially open to legal discovery.&nbsp; Ultimately, no matter how secure the messaging platform, if what you need to talk about is very, very sensitive, it&#39;s probably best to just &quot; get everyone in a room together .&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-add-someone-to-a-signal-group-chat-201430756.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed again. Publisher Paradox Interactive announced today that it is now targeting release in October 2025 instead of the first half of this year. &quot;Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date,&quot; the company said. Creating the sequel has been a trial of endurance that would test even an immortal undead&#39;s patience. Paradox parted ways with the game&#39;s original developer, Hardsuit Labs, in 2021. The Chinese Room, which made notable indie games Dear Esther and Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture , joined the project as developer in 2023. Today&#39;s update from offered some encouragement that the project is now in &quot;a late development stage,&quot; however it has decided to discontinue dev diaries that offered behind-the-scenes peeks at progress. The original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines game came out in 2004 after its own challenging development. Made by the now-shuttered Troika Studios, it was an story-driven game inspired by a tabletop RPG about several vampire clans in a modern-day Los Angeles. It was a commercial flop, but acquired a loyal audience over the years and even cultivated a community for mods and fan games .

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-uk-could-greenlight-direct-to-phone-satellite-services-this-year-183504094.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you live in a rural area of the UK, you may soon be able to use your phone for satellite calls, messages and other standard data use. On Tuesday, the nation&#39;s telecom regulator, Ofcom, proposed using direct-to-device satellite tech to connect people in the UK&#39;s &quot;most rural and hard-to-reach places,&quot; like mountains and remote villages. Ofcom sees the tech complementing traditional networks, aiming to provide 100 percent mobile coverage in the UK. The regulator said the tech could also provide backup coverage during outages, offer service to ships and passengers in coastal waters without a connection and provide emergency 999 services (the UK&#39;s version of 911) in remote areas. In January, British telecom Vodafone made the world&#39;s first satellite video call using a standard mobile phone on a remote mountain in west Wales. Regarding the regulatory details, Ofcom suggests amending existing mobile spectrum licenses for frequencies already used by cellular providers (below 3 GHz). However, the regulator also offered alternative approaches, including introducing a new license for satellite services or allowing license-exempt use if certain conditions are met. Regardless of its specific policy approach, Ofcom said strict conditions would be attached to avoid interference with existing spectrum users in the UK and overseas. Ofcom is opening a consultation period with stakeholders from now to May 20. Depending on the feedback it receives, it could begin authorizing direct-to-device calls later this year.&nbsp; The iPhone 14 series was the first standard handset to offer direct-to-satellite emergency messaging . In iOS 18, Apple expanded the functionality beyond crises to any situation where you&#39;re off the grid . The Samsung Galaxy S25 series and Google Pixel 9 recently added similar functionality .

    "description": "Sunderfolk , a game that borrows elements from tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and couch party games like Jackbox, has a launch date. The fantasy RPG from Dreamhaven (the stomping ground of Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime ) arrives on April 23. You can play a demo today through April 7. While virtual tabletops like Wizards of the Coast&#39;s Sigil act as video game-like extensions of a traditional tabletop experience, Sunderfolk &#39;s premise is in using modern technology to simulate something like D&amp;D — but with more accessibility to casual players. Here, your phone becomes the deck of cards (and controller), while your TV or monitor is the game board. Although it supports remote play, this one sounds tailor-made for couch co-op. The game&#39;s story retreads familiar fantasy tropes, like a town of peaceful inhabitants invaded by dark and creepy monsters. Here, the heroes are a clan of anthropomorphic animals who each fit a familiar class like arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger or rogue. You can customize each with weapons, armor, items and skills as they level up. (When in doubt, play the classics!) Dreamhaven &quot;We were, with Sunderfolk, really trying to create something that would inspire people to get together in person,&quot; Game Director Erin Marek said in a preview trailer. &quot;We wanted it to feel similar to a game night, getting together to play a board game or getting together to play D&amp;D with a group of friends or family or loved ones that you really care about. And to share that experience together side-by-side.&quot; You can gather your cohorts to try the game for free on GeForce Now from now to April 7. The preview gives you access to all playable characters and an early part of the game. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need a paid GeForce membership ; a free account will do. Sunderfolk will cost $50 and be playable Steam , PS5 , Xbox Series X and Switch. But only the party member running the big-screen device needs to own the game; the phone app (iOS and Android) for your pals will be a free download when the game launches on April 23.

    "description": "Google has the pedal to the metal on its AI development. Just a few months after the debut of Gemini 2.0 , the tech giant has unveiled another upgrade in Gemini 2.5 . As with any new AI launch, Google is touting a strong performance on LMArena for Gemini 2.5, particularly its capabilities in coding, mathematics and science. The first model in this series is Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Google said this is a thinking model that&#39;s intended to provide responses grounded in more reasoning, analysis and context than the answers offered by classification- and prediction-driven models. It&#39;s a different approach than Google took with the Gemini 2.0 series, which started off with the more efficient and less expensive Flash version. &quot;With Gemini 2.5, we&#39;ve achieved a new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training,&quot; the company said in a blog post attributed to Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO of Google DeepMind. &quot;Going forward, we’re building these thinking capabilities directly into all of our models, so they can handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.&quot; Google had only just started rolling out Gemini 2.0 to its services, using it to power the newly added AI Mode in search and Deep Research for handling more complex queries. With today&#39;s launch, expect to hear more updates from the company about getting this latest version. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is available now in Google AI Studio, and Gemini Advanced members can use it directly in the Gemini app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-releases-gemini-25-ai-model-for-complex-thinking-182352224.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI just announced that all users will soon be able to generate images directly inside of ChatGPT. It’s rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team and, most importantly, Free users. This will be the default image generation tool in 4o, so there will be no need to open Dall-E whenever you want to whip up a picture of a cat in space eating lasagna or whatever. The feature’s also coming to Sora. The company says that the platform will &quot;generate high-quality images based on your prompt, conversation and uploaded files.&quot; To the latter point, it’ll be able to transform pre-existing images based on prompts. OpenAI is also boasting about significant improvements in text rendering and contextual understanding. These new tools are intended for both personal and professional use. As such, OpenAI gives a number of examples as to where this type of image generation could come in handy. These include the creation of infographics, social media promotional graphics and images with plenty of text, as seen below.&nbsp; OpenAI This being a modern generation tool, it can also handle high-end visuals. The company says it offers a &quot;strong capability for photorealism, including light, shadow, and texture accuracy.&quot; The ability to understand context could also be useful, as OpenAI says this could be used to create a “poster of birds found in Central Park” or a &quot;visualization of an art history era discussed previously in the conversation.&quot; Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqN Text and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx — OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 13, 2024 It&#39;s built on GPT-4o, an AI model that was first released last year . The &quot;o&quot; stands for &quot;omni&quot;, which is a reference to the model’s multimodal capabilities. This is what allows many of the aforementioned features, like being able to iterate on uploaded files. Today’s news looks like another step on the long road toward the “one AI to rule them all” functionality that Sam Altman teased a few weeks back .

    "description": "Apple announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference will be on June 9-13. The company is usually consistent with its event timing, so Tim Cook will probably take the stage to start the keynote on June 9 at 10AM PT/1PM ET. We&#39;ve already heard that iOS 19 and macOS 16 will be sporting new looks , so expect a focus on the latest software changes. And there&#39;s no way we won&#39;t be getting more Apple Intelligence updates. It was a core part of the iOS 18.3 update that rolled out at the start of the year and Apple has had struggles with some of the AI-powered features, particularly its notification summaries . One thing we don&#39;t anticipate seeing is the long-awaited update to Siri that will offer more personalization, also courtesy of Apple Intelligence. That project hit a delay in March and, no matter how hard we might hope otherwise , it seems unlikely the issues will all be resolved by June. Although the keynote is happening in-person at Apple Park, the rest of WWDC will take place online and is free for developers to attend.

    "description": "It&#39;s your lucky day if you&#39;re looking for good deals on Apple devices . Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , the Apple Watch Series 10 has dropped to its lowest price to date. The smartwatch is back on sale for a record-low price of $299. That&#39;s a $100 discount. The Apple Watch SE got a discount too. The device typically retails for $249, but you can snap it up for $169 . The Apple Watch Series 10 is our pick for the best smartwatch overall . That may not necessarily apply if you&#39;re an Android user, since you need an iPhone to actually use an Apple Watch. In any case, we gave the Apple Watch Series 10 a score of 90 in our review . Apple&#39;s current flagship smartwatch has a bigger screen, making it easier to see your notifications and health data (it&#39;s a pretty dang great device for wellness and fitness tracking). The thinner frame makes it more aesthetically pleasing too. On the downside, losing the blood oxygen feature from previous models is a bummer, but that issue was out of Apple&#39;s hands to a certain extent . It&#39;s perhaps not quite worth an upgrade if you have a Series 8 or 9 already. Apple isn&#39;t exactly reinventing the wheel here. Plus the sleep apnea detection feature that debuted alongside the Series 10 is also available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Still, if you&#39;re an Apple Watch newcomer or upgrading from an even older model, the Series 10 is likely your best option, especially for the sake of future proofing.

    "description": "Waymo is continuing to expand its foothold across the US, having recently started offering paid robotaxi services in more parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. Next up are Atlanta and Miami , and now the company has revealed plans to offer its driverless Waymo One service in the nation&#39;s capital in 2026. Before that can happen, though, Waymo will need to get approval from regulators. The company says it will &quot;continue to work closely with policymakers to formalize the regulations needed to operate without a human behind the wheel in the District.&quot; DC currently requires autonomous vehicles to have a human at the wheel, ready to take control if necessary. “Our priority remains ensuring that any company operating in the District — such as Waymo — does so in a manner that prioritizes safety, aligns with our regulatory framework, and integrates seamlessly into DC’s unique transportation ecosystem,” German Vigil, a spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, told The Washington Post . He noted that the agency is refining its approach to regulation &quot;based on public input, emerging best practices and lessons learned” from other jurisdictions. Waymo has tested its vehicles in DC for several years and it plans to &quot;continue introducing ourselves to DC’s communities and emergency responders over the coming months.&quot; Per the Post , if and when Waymo One does become available in the District, the robotaxis would not take riders to any of the region&#39;s airports, as they wouldn&#39;t (at least at the outset) have a permit to cross into Maryland or Virginia.

    "description": "Instagram is adding another tool to its arsenal of anti-bullying measures. This time, however, Meta is enlisting school officials directly in an effort to speed up its response to safety issues affecting young teens. The company is introducing a new “Schools Partnership Program” that aims to give teachers and school administrators a way to intervene when students experience bullying on Instagram. The program offers schools something that many parents have long said they wanted: a way to fast-track in-app reports that directly affect young students. Meta is promising that schools who join the program will have their reports “prioritized” in its moderation queue, and that it will respond to these reports within 48 hours. Schools that sign up will also get a “school partner” badge appended to their Instagram account, along with in-app information about how to use its reporting tools and other resources. Notably though, it doesn’t sound like Meta is hiring additional content moderators to aid with these new fast-tracked reports. When asked about increasing headcount to support the program, an Instagram spokesperson told Engadget only that reports from schools will be “expedited” via its existing reporting channels, and that schools will be able to add &quot;additional context&quot; to their reports. Meta says it’s already tested the program with 60 schools and that early results have been “promising.” Now, middle schools and high schools in the United States can sign up to join a waitlist for the program. The pilot program is far from the first time Instagram has tried to address bullying. The app introduced comment limiting features in 2021 , and added a tougher &quot; restrict &quot; feature last year. But while these features can help teens avoid certain types of negative interactions, they still required teens (or their parents) to tweak their settings. By now giving schools more authority to report specific instances of bullying or other bad behavior, Meta is offering some hope that it will be easier for schools to address the underlying behavior.

    "description": "When Sony&#39;s wireless earbuds come to mind, the flagship-quality WF-1000XM5 is probably the first product that jumps out. However, the company is also adept at building budget models, blending features and tech to give users a solid value for a lot less money. That was the proposition when the WF-C700N arrived in 2023 , offering active noise cancellation (ANC), solid battery life and other features for $120. Now, Sony is back with the successor to those earbuds, the WF-C710N , that packs a host of improvements but keeps the price the same.&nbsp; First, Sony says it improved ANC performance by employing dual mics on each earbud on the C710N. The C700N only had one on each side. The company is also using AI Noise Reduction this time around to improve call quality. On the outside, Sony replaced the physical button for the onboard controls with a touch panel, and the company added wear detection for added convenience.&nbsp; You can also expect longer battery life on the C710N. At 8.5 hours with ANC enabled, that&#39;s an hour longer than the C700N. With ANC off, you can expect up to two hours more than the previous model. Additionally, total battery life including the case is doubled, with up to 30 hours of noise-canceling use available (up to 40 hours with ANC off). Sony improved the quick charge feature as well, giving you an hour of play time in five minutes instead of the previous 10-minute window. The WF-C710N is available for preorder today in black, white, pink and a transparent Glass Blue for $120. I guess Sony&#39;s confusing product names aren&#39;t entirely going away after all.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-overhauls-its-budget-earbuds-while-keeping-the-price-the-same-010025194.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/discords-redesigned-pc-app-has-multiple-dark-modes-a-new-overlay-and-more-160019822.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Discord has begun rolling out a redesigned desktop app that adds more customization to the client. To start, the new app increases the number of free themes to four. Where previously you could choose between two skins — light and dark — if you weren&#39;t a Nitro subscriber, now your options are light, ash, dark and onyx. In short, everyone gets access to more dark themes. Discord has also added three new UI density options — default, spacious and compact. These are separate from the app&#39;s existing message layout options, so it&#39;s another way to tweak the look and feel of the interface. With this redesign, the company is also finally giving users the option to resize the channel list. Discord has also redesigned the controls that appear when you&#39;re on a voice or video call. Now, more of the buttons you may want to press during a call will appear in the center bar along the bottom of the screen. At the same time, the mic and camera buttons feature more color, so you have a better indicator if you&#39;re muted or your camera is active. &quot;All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,&quot; Discord explains. Discord Separately, the redesigned app ships with a new overlay that Discord says is faster and won&#39;t impact game performance. Taking a page Valve&#39;s recent redesign of Steam , Discord has reworked the interface around widgets, meaning you can move around each individual element as you wish. The company has also re-engineered the overlay so that it doesn&#39;t &quot;hook&quot; itself into games. As a result, it&#39;s less likely to trigger anti-cheat systems like BattleEye . In turn, that means the new overlay is compatible with &quot;a larger portion of the most-played games on Discord.&quot; It&#39;s even possible to watch a friend&#39;s stream directly from the new overlay. The redesigned app and overlay arrive after Discord CEO Jason Citron announced last May the company would refocus on building the best possible communications tool for gamers. In 2020, Discord briefly rebranded itself as a general purpose chat app after many young people turned to the platform to stay in touch with their friends during lockdown. &quot;After taking stock of the world now that the pandemic is largely behind us, and learning directly from you about how Discord can be even more useful, we&#39;ve recognized the need to narrow our focus from broadly being a community-centric chat app to being a place that helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests,&quot; Citron wrote last year. The update also arrives at what could be a pivotal moment for Discord. According to a recent New York Times report , the company could go public as early as later this year. With 72 percent of Discord users regularly gaming on PC, ensuring those people are taken care of ahead of a potential IPO takes on a sense of urgency.

    "description": "It&#39;s no secret that Dyson devices are pricey, but you can find good sales on them if you&#39;re patient and know where to look. Case in point, the Amazon Spring Sale : not only are a few Dyson cordless vacuums included amongst the discounts, but this Dyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus heater and fan is as well. You can snag it for $300, or $170 off its usual price. As its name suggests, the Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus can heat your room in the winter and cool it off in the summer. Its fan mode includes Air Multiplier tech, which creates a smooth and uninterrupted airstream thanks to its lack of traditional fan blades. When you need some warmth, its ceramic plates heat up quickly. The appliance has two modes: focused and diffused. Focused mode warms or cools one person, while diffused mode heats your entire room or provides a gentle breeze during the summer. It oscillates at a 70-degree angle. Dyson&#39;s fan has a sleep timer with a shutoff range between 15 minutes and nine hours, and you can store its curved and magnetized remote control inside the appliance to help prevent it from being lost. The lowest we&#39;ve ever seen this product&#39;s price drop is $280, so being able to snag it for $300 in the middle of March, when we&#39;re nowhere near Black Friday or Prime Day, is about as good a deal as you can hope for. If you&#39;re on the market for other Dyson gear , a few more devices are included in the Amazon Spring Sale, including the Dyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum on discount for $330.

Yes, their lack of wireless charging and in-ear detection stings a bit at their typical list price, but their see-through design is slick enough that the shortcomings are (almost) forgivable. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23725921/beats-studio-buds-plus-earbuds-review-translucent-clear\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re not dead set on noise cancellation but would still like a pair of Apple earbuds, the recently released <strong>AirPods 4</strong> are matching their all-time low of $99.99 ($30 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Effortless/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-4/11381374703/\">Walmart</a> right now.

As it turns out, having a battery pack that can charge your device in a jiffy and double as a lanyard is pretty great. Luckily, you can snag one of the most affordable 20,000mAh models out there, <strong>Anker’s 30W Zolo</strong> <strong>power bank</strong>, for $24.61 (about $11 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9LH53B?th=1\">Amazon</a>.

Although not originally priced as such, it’s considered an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23691498/best-garmin-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-wearables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entry-level fitness watch for Garmin fans</a>. It’s pretty stylish, overall, and can last just as long and do just as much as a Fitbit (if not more). We also like it for its wide breadth of health and workout-tracking features, along with its support for built-in GPS and contactless payments. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23500640/garmin-venu-sq-2-review-smartwatch-fitness-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read our full review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"other-verge-favorites\">Other <em>Verge</em> favorites</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Blue Yeti microphone</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY6Z2M6/\">Amazon</a> in a myriad of colors starting at $89.99 ($40 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One of our go-to gift guide picks, the <strong>Instant Pot Duo Plus</strong>, is currently available for an all-time low of $89.95 ($40 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBKTPTS\">Amazon</a>. Multiple <em>Verge</em> staffers swear by the six-quart multi-cooker, which is similar to the base-model instant pot but comes with a few additional smart programs, including a customizable sous vide setting and a cake option that lets you pressure cook at high temperature for 40 minutes. That’s in addition to the ability to cook rice, steam veggies, and sauté, among other actions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Govee may be best known for its ambient TV backlighting, but it also makes lighting products to illuminate your entire living space in shades of RGB. One of its most stunning lights, the <strong>Smart Table Lamp 2</strong>, is on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D41XL87F\">Amazon</a>. It can provide vibrant lights for a gathering, or you can adjust its color temperature to suit your bedtime and wake-up rituals better.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Having access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed. If you’ll be out in the wild, or if you’re vacationing but want to be cautious when it comes to water intake, the <strong>LifeStraw Peak</strong> is worth picking up at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SBPWHS7/\">Amazon</a> for its current price of $18.62 ($6 off). It’s essentially a thick straw outfitted with a filter that’s capable of removing 99.9 percent of bacteria, parasites, and microplastics from the water you’re drinking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cagiwiru’s Cordless Air Blower / Duster</strong>&nbsp;is down to an all-time low of $18.04 ($7 off) at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CAGIWIRU-Compressed-Cordless-LED-Light-no-dusters-car/dp/B0CCD7KPM6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a> (at checkout). It might not be as powerful as a can of compressed air, but it’s close, and it’s much more versatile with its swappable tips, built-in light, and ability to recharge via USB-C.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>AeroPress Go </strong>is nearly matching its best price to date at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Portable-Travel-Coffee-Press/dp/B07YVL8SF3/\">Amazon</a>, where you can pick it up for $31.95 ($18 off). It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst <em>Verge </em>staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the <strong>ChomChom Roller</strong>, especially since it&#8217;s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BAGTNAQ\">Amazon</a> for $19.59 ($5 off). This simple tool can de-fur your couch faster and more effectively than most vacuums, even if it’s not the best tool for ridding clothes of unwanted hair.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We like Hoto’s svelte toolkits for a couple of reasons. They strike a minimalistic look, for one thing, and they incorporate at least one power tool. The company’s <strong>Drill Tool Set</strong> — which is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YTNLDJG\">Amazon</a> for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you own a newer Samsung Galaxy phone and need an alternative to AirTags, it’s worth considering the<strong> Galaxy SmartTag2</strong>, which is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCC69HN3/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-SmartTag2-Anti-loss-Bluetooth-tag-for-cellular-phone-white/5101078318/\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.chewy.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag2-bluetooth/dp/1453190\">Chewy</a> for $16.96 (about $13 off), its second-best price to date. It’s similar to Apple’s item trackers in that it uses ultra-wideband Bluetooth to provide pinpoint, compass-guided directions to your lost items. They can also tap into the Galaxy Find network and offer up to 500 days of battery life, or up to 40 percent longer in a low-power state.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, March 26th:</strong> Updated to reflect current pricing/availability and several new deals, including those for the Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener and Sharge’s Retractable 65 charger.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

On Wednesday, the company announced a wholly online banking platform that will offer checking and savings accounts to Robinhood Gold subscribers when it launches this fall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The platform, called Robinhood Banking, will let users access their accounts, as well as send and receive money through the Robinhood Credit Card app. It even attempts to make up for not having a physical location by having physical cash “delivered on-demand right to your doorstep.” There still aren’t many details about how this will work, but Robinhood says “coverage varies based on geographic location.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/robinhood-banking-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Image: Robinhood\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Robinhood Banking promises a 4 percent annual percentage yield (APY) and FDIC insurance of up to $2.5 million on accounts. The company notes that since it’s not an FDIC-insured bank, it’s offering “pass-through” insurance provided by FDIC member Coastal Community Bank. Pass-through insurance involves insuring people’s funds by holding them “at an FDIC-insured bank through a third party,” <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/financial-institution-employees-guide-deposit-insurance/pass-through-deposit-insurance-coverage\">according to the FDIC</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The service will offer individual and joint banking accounts at launch, along with options to create children’s accounts. Deepak Rao, Robinhood Money’s general manager and vice president, says the platform is designed to “solve many of the challenges presented by legacy banks.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/robinhood-strategies.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.5129669767739,100,92.974066046452\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Robinhood Strategies can manage your investments. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Robinhood\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Robinhood\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to a bank account, Robinhood is launching a new wealth management platform called Robinhood Strategies. It will offer access to a mix of single stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which “are actively managed to provide access to more opportunities.” The funds have a 0.25 percent annual management fee, with a yearly cap of $250 for Robinhood Gold members. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Robinhood Strategies is available to Robinhood Gold members today, but it’s coming to all customers next month. <a href=\"https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/gold-overview/\">Robinhood Gold</a> is the company’s $5 per month (or $50 per year) subscription program that offers features like margin investing and larger instant deposits.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/robinhood-cortex.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Robinhood\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Later this year, Robinhood also plans to launch an AI-powered investment tool called Cortex for Gold subscribers. It will provide analyses and insights about the current market, such as why a particular stock is going up or down, as well as which stocks to consider trading.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the years, Robinhood has transformed itself from a simple investing app into an all-in-one hub for users’ finances. The company <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/robinhood-ventures-further-beyond-trading-with-new-credit-card-2024-03-26/\">launched a credit card</a> in 2024 as part of efforts to encourage people to keep their money within the widening Robinhood ecosystem, where they’ll now be able to store and withdraw cash to make investments on the app, too.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But in a far-from-typical political climate, the mood was tense and confrontational.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republican lawmakers are eager to revive a handful of bipartisan bills like the Kids Online Safety Act, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324276/kids-online-safety-act-parent-advocates\">House Republican leadership blocked at the finish line</a> last year. Many Democrats on the panel support these proposals, calling them an urgent response to a social crisis. But they&#8217;re raising a new question: as the Trump administration ignores congressional statutes and Supreme Court precedent to gut the federal government, will there be anyone left to enforce these laws?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last week, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/632267/democratic-ftc-commissioners-alvaro-bedoya-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-illegally-fired-trump\">abruptly —&nbsp;and under current law, illegally — attempted to fire the two sitting Democratic commissioners</a> on the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. The move left two Republicans on the commission, with one more expected to soon be confirmed. Like many agencies across the federal government, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/623242/federal-trade-commission-terminations\">FTC has seen recent staff cuts</a>, though in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621757/cfpb-doge-worker-layoffs-sworn-declaration\">far smaller numbers than many of the most prominent targets</a> of the right. Even in the minority party, Slaughter and Bedoya <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/632944/democratic-ftc-commissioner-alvaro-bedoya-tech-billionaires-trump\">warn that their removals will thwart transparency and accountability</a> for any decisions made in their absence, and they’re planning to sue to return to their work. Without dissenting voices in the room, Slaughter and Bedoya have warned, there’s no one to push back and illustrate what alternative paths the FTC could have taken, or provide important context to the agency’s decisions. “I&#8217;m going to be even more worried about actions taken to withdraw settlements, modify settlements, [and] votes taken to not sue a company,” Bedoya told reporters outside the hearing room. “If there&#8217;s an action brought up to the commission, and the commissioners say no, that never becomes public.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We had in place what was needed to protect our children,” ranking member of the commerce subcommittee Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) said in her opening remarks. “And that’s why I am absolutely furious right now that there has been this effort to fire the two members of the FTC.” The Democratic minority invited Slaughter to testify alongside witnesses invited by Republicans, including representatives from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), and Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) — the latter, as one Democrat pointed out, <a href=\"https://www.project2025.org/about/advisory-board/\">contributed to Project 2025</a>. Bedoya, though not formally invited, sat behind his colleague in the hearing room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“This hearing is about children. It’s not about what’s going on here in Washington, DC”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republicans painted the FTC firings as a distraction. “This hearing is about children. It’s not about what’s going on here in Washington, DC,” said full committee Chair Brett Guthrie (R-KY). When reporters outside the hearing room asked about the attempted firings, subcommittee Chair Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) said he’s “focused on the hearing today.” Rep. Erin Houchin (R-IN) apologized to parents in the audience “for the things that are being taken away from this conversation not being focused on protecting children, but instead on someone’s job at the FTC.” Houchin complained that a reporter had stopped her in the hallway to ask about the agency. “Shame on the media if the only thing they cover from today is the FTC, because children are dying,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Democrats argued that laws are useless without effective enforcement, which they believe is under threat. The FTC would be primarily in charge of enforcing two major bills that passed through the House Energy and Commerce Committee last year: KOSA and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) &#8220;We can talk about the importance of passing new legislation here in this hearing,&#8221; said KOSA co-sponsor Kathy Castor (D-FL). But she questioned how they could regain trust in Republicans “ if you take the cops off the beat, you give the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347448/tech-ceos-spotted-at-the-inauguration\">Big Tech CEOs a front row seat to the inauguration</a>, [and] you block the KOSA and COPPA that was hammered out over years of work in this committee?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The questions about rule of law and who will enforce it extend far beyond the FTC. In empowering Elon Musk’s pet project, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Trump has deputized the richest man in the world to slash the federal workforce, and seek to shut down agencies created by congressional statute. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/\">asserted power over what are supposed to be independent agencies</a>, including the FTC, and loyalists he’s appointed to run them have so far welcomed him to do so. Many experts say we already are or soon could be in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/politics/constitutional-crisis-courts-trump-executive-power-what-matters/index.html\">constitutional crisis</a>, as Trump appears willing to flout everything from a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/635019/tiktok-ban-deadline-extension-trump-markey-van-hollen-booker\">law seeking to ban TikTok</a> to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/16/trump-white-house-defy-judge-deport-venezuelans\">court orders</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), ranking member of the full committee, even pointed out that Republicans were the reason KOSA didn&#8217;t pass last year. “Let’s not kid the people here to suggest that these bills are going to become law,” he said. “The bottom line is we passed KOSA and we passed COPPA out of this committee last session and the House Republican leadership refused to bring these laws to the floor. And you know why? They&#8217;re in the pocket of Big Tech. And Big Tech does not care at all about kids.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">KOSA and COPPA 2.0 both garnered criticism that, as written, they could infringe on speech and privacy. But this criticism could extend to virtually any child safety law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Slaughter echoed Democrats’ sentiment to reporters after the hearing. “You can&#8217;t meaningfully address kids online safety in bills that would empower the FTC to enforce kids online safety, if you don&#8217;t talk about whether the FTC is a functional body consistent with the design of Congress,” she said.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Trump said the taxes would go into effect on April 2nd — the same time he’s expected to introduce <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/trump-tariffs-april-2\">a round of reciprocal tariffs</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/26/business/trump-tariffs-auto-cars?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\"><em>The New York Times</em>.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tariffs, which Trump called “permanent,” would also apply to American companies that manufacture vehicles in other countries and then bring them into the US. Trump said the tariffs would result in “tremendous growth in the auto industry,” though they’re expected to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/trump-auto-tariffs-car-prices.html\">drive up prices for consumers</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/26/trump-tariffs-autos-cars\">pointed out by <em>Axios</em></a>, a <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/working_papers/ecwp_2024-02-c.pdf\">2024 analysis</a> from the US International Trade Commission found that a 25 percent tariff on cars shipped to the US could reduce imports by 74 percent, while the average vehicle price could increase by five percent. Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/623403/trump-imposes-tariffs-mexico-canada-china\">tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico</a> have already gone into effect, affecting a wide range of products like clothing, food, lithium batteries, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The April 2nd tariffs are expected to “be customized for each US trading partner,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/trump-s-reciprocal-tariffs-what-are-they-which-countries-will-be-most-affected\">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>.

The new feature, as spotted by <a href=\"https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2025/03/26/kindle-software-update-5-18-1-released-with-unusual-new-feature/\"><em>The eBook Reader</em></a>, is listed in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW&amp;ref_=hp_201733150_Kindle-E-Reader-Software-Updat\">release notes for the 5.18.1 update</a> and can be found in Settings &gt; Device Options.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new software wasn’t immediately available as an over-the-air update for my Kindle Colorsoft, but I was able to download it and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFAE5G5UGCYA25DW\">install it manually following Amazon’s instructions</a>. The feature works well using relatively light taps anywhere on the Colorsoft, and since it requires two taps in rapid succession, it’s not easy to trigger by mistake. Unfortunately, it’s limited to just one direction. You can either use it to jump to the next page, or scroll down a long list of books. Perhaps a future update will enable triple-taps as a way to scroll up or go back to a previous page.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although the 5.18.1 software update is also available for older versions of the entry-level Kindle, Paperwhite, Scribe, and Oasis, the new double-tap feature is only available for the Colorsoft and 12th-generation Paperwhite, Amazon spokesperson Connor Rice confirmed to <em>The Verge</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, March 26th: </em></strong><em>Added confirmation from an Amazon spokesperson.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The company adds that view counts may be higher following the change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new view-counting system seems designed to bring creators’ view counts in line with what they see on TikTok and Instagram. Despite the change, YouTube will continue tracking the old Shorts metric under an “engaged views” option in its analytics dashboard. It will also keep using “engaged views” to determine how much a creator earns and their eligibility for the YouTube Partnership Program.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

    "description": "\n              <p>Just a few months after releasing its first <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/\">Gemini 2.0 AI models</a>, Google is upgrading again. <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/\">The company says</a> the new Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is its \"most intelligent\" model yet, offering a massive context window, multimodality, and reasoning capabilities. Google points to a raft of benchmarks that show the new Gemini clobbering other large language models (LLMs), and our testing seems to back that up—Gemini 2.5 Pro is one of the most impressive generative AI models we've seen.</p>\n<p>Gemini 2.5, like all Google's models going forward, has reasoning built in. The AI essentially fact-checks itself along the way to generating an output. We like to call this \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\">simulated reasoning</a>,\" as there's no evidence that this process is akin to human reasoning. However, it can go a long way to improving LLM outputs. Google specifically cites the model's \"agentic\" coding capabilities as a beneficiary of this process. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental can, for example, generate a full working video game from a single prompt. We've tested this, and it works with the publicly available version of the model.</p>\n<div class=\"ars-video\"><div class=\"relative\" allow=\"fullscreen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLCBSpgos6s?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent\"></div><div class=\"caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300\">\n    <div class=\"caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0\"></div>\n    <div class=\"caption-content\">\n      Gemini 2.5 Pro builds a game in one step.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Google says a lot of things about Gemini 2.5 Pro; it's smarter, it's context-aware, it <em>thinks</em>—but it's hard to quantify what constitutes improvement in generative AI bots. There are some clear technical upsides, though. Gemini 2.5 Pro comes with a 1 million token context window, which is common for the big Gemini models but massive compared to competing models like OpenAI GPT or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/\">Anthropic Claude</a>.

    "description": "\n              <p>Being Red Bull Racing 1 teammates with Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen is a hard ask. The Dutch driver took his fourth consecutive world championship last year, dominating the sport to such an extent that he led the points table across a 63-race, 1,029-day streak that only ended with McLaren and Lando Norris' victory in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/a-tough-race-for-the-rookies-as-f1-starts-2025-in-australia/\">Australia</a> earlier this month. Now we believe he's going to have his second teammate of the year, after just two races, as Red Bull gets ready to drop Liam Lawson for Yuki Tsunoda.</p>\n<p>For three of its championship years, Red Bull built the fastest car in F1, and Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez scored race wins and plenty of points to help the team secure the constructors championships in 2021, 2022, and 2023. But Red Bulls' designers have been evolving a concept that even its former design boss <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/newey-considers-if-lack-of-experience-at-red-bull-contributed-to-recent-car.63B4wB6BZK35hqwjiIZcCN\">Adrian Newey</a> thinks <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/newey-considers-if-lack-of-experience-at-red-bull-contributed-to-recent-car.63B4wB6BZK35hqwjiIZcCN\">is flawed</a>, and in 2024, we saw Perez' form evaporate after the first handful of races that year.</p>\n<p>Verstappen was able to fight for the title thanks to his considerable skill in the car. But the team lost out to both McLaren <em>and</em> Ferrari in the constructors' standings, something that will have had a very considerable impact upon the end-of-year bonuses for Red Bull's hundreds of employees.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/red-bull-makes-up-its-mind-liams-out-yukis-in-for-japan/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/red-bull-makes-up-its-mind-liams-out-yukis-in-for-japan/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

I sat down with fellow Ars staffers Aaron Zimmerman and Lee Hutchinson to talk through what we had just seen, covering everything from those goats to the show's pacing. Warning: Huge spoilers for seasons 1 and 2 follow!</p>\n<p><strong>Nate:</strong> <em>Severance</em> season 1 was a smaller-scale, almost claustrophobic show about a crazy office, its \"waffle parties,\" and the personal life of Mark Scout, mourning his dead wife and \"severing\" his consciousness to avoid that pain. It followed a compact group of characters, centered around the four \"refiners\" who worked on Lumon's severed floor. But season 2 blew up that cozy/creepy world and started following more characters—including far more \"outies\"—to far more places. Did the show manage to maintain its unique vibe while making significant changes to pacing, character count, and location?</p>\n<p><strong>Lee:</strong> I think so, but as you say, things were different this time around. One element that I’m glad carried through was the show’s consistent use of a very specific visual language. (I am an absolute sucker for visual storytelling. My favorite Kubrick film is <em>Barry Lyndon</em>. I’ll forgive a lot of plot holes if they’re beautifully shot.) Season 2, especially in the back half, treats us to an absolute smorgasbord of incredible visuals—bifurcated shots symbolizing severance and duality, stark whites and long hallways, and my personal favorite: Chris Walken in a black turtleneck seated in front of a fireplace, like Satan holding court in Hell. The storytelling might be a bit less focused, but it looks great.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/praise-kier-for-severance-season-2-lets-discuss/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/praise-kier-for-severance-season-2-lets-discuss/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

Most people use their Nvidia GPUs for games, but why not both? Nvidia has a new AI you can run at the same time, having just<a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-assist-ai-companion-for-rtx-ai-pcs/\"> released</a> its experimental G-Assist AI. It runs locally on your GPU to help you optimize your PC and get the most out of your games. It can do some neat things, but Nvidia isn't kidding when it says this tool is experimental.</p>\n<p>G-Assist is available in the Nvidia desktop app, and it consists of a floating overlay window. After invoking the overlay, you can either type or speak to G-Assist to check system stats or make tweaks to your settings. You can ask basic questions like, \"How does DLSS Frame Generation work?\" but it also has control over some system-level settings.</p>\n<p>By calling up G-Assist, you can get a rundown of how your system is running, including custom data charts created on the fly by G-Assist. You can also ask the AI to tweak your machine, for example, optimizing the settings for a particular game or toggling on or off a setting. G-Assist can even overclock your GPU if you so choose, complete with a graph of expected performance gains.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/no-cloud-needed-nvidia-creates-gaming-centric-ai-chatbot-that-runs-on-your-gpu/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/no-cloud-needed-nvidia-creates-gaming-centric-ai-chatbot-that-runs-on-your-gpu/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

    "description": "AI 技术对电力的狂热需求可以上溯到 2012 年的 AlexNet。当时多伦多大学的 AI 研究员 Alex Krizhevsky、 Ilya Sutskever 和 Geoffrey E. Hinton 正在为图像识别竞赛 ImageNet LSRVC 开发一种卷积神经网络。在当时图像识别是非常有挑战性的。研究人员认为他们需要一个庞大的神经网络，该网络以首席研究员的名字命名为 AlexNet，它有超过 6000 万参数和 65 万个神经元。但一大问题是如此大的神经网络如何进行训练？他们的实验室里有几张英伟达 GTX 580 显卡，每张配备了 3GB 显存，但 AlexNet 太大没办法加载到单张显卡上。研究人员设法将训练阶段划分到两张并行工作的 GPU 上——一半神经元在一张 GPU 上，另一半在另一张上运行。AlexNet 以压倒性优势赢得了 2012 年的比赛，从此 AI 模型的规模不再受限于单张显卡了，而妖精也从瓶子里释放了出来。在 AlexNet 之后，越来越强大的 AI 模型需要成千上万张 GPU。根据 Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)的报告，2010 年到 2020 年间数据中心的功耗相对平稳，原因是英伟达数据中心 GPU 的功耗同期提升了大约 15 倍，因此能保持数据中心功耗的稳定。到了 2022 年基于 transformer 的大模型的出现推动了数据中心功耗的大幅提升。大模型需要处理数百亿甚至数千亿个神经元，训练之后的推理阶段还需要处理大量数据。Open AI 在训练新模型时使用了超过 25,000 张英伟达 Ampere 100 GPU，持续了 100 天，耗电量 50 GW 时，足以满足一个中型城镇一年的电力需求。根据 Google 的数据，训练占 AI 模型生命周期总耗电量的四成，剩下的六成是推理。功耗的飙升促使科学家思考如何在不牺牲性能的情况下减少内存和计算要求。研究人员尝试了模型剪枝、量化等优化方法。",

    "description": "马德里卡洛斯三世大学与亚利桑那州立大学以及萨拉曼卡大学联合开展的一项科学研究表明，家族企业比非家族企业表现出更多的环境责任行为，更具可持续性。在这项研究中，家族企业被定义为创始人或其亲属、后代拥有至少 25% 投票权的企业。研究发现，当家族企业成员加入董事会并参与公司管理时，家族企业推行减少温室气体排放的绿色政策的意愿会更加强烈。该项研究基于来自22个欧洲国家的数据（研究结果可推广至整个欧洲），并表明采取此类旨在促进环境可持续性做法的家族企业也取得了优异的财务业绩。“这可能令人惊讶，但我们的研究表明，减少污染不仅不会给社会带来成本，也不会给企业带来‘经济代价’，实际上还可以提升与企业社会责任相关的行动所带来的社会和经济效益。”",

    "description": "标准宇宙模型「ΛCDM（Lambda-Cold Dark Matter，宇宙常数–冷暗物质模型）」是现代宇宙学的主流理论架构，成功解释了宇宙中大尺度结构的形成与演化。根据该模型，宇宙中仅有约 5% 的物质为的普通物质，其余则由暗物质（约25%）与暗能量（约70%）构成。暗能量被视为驱动宇宙加速膨胀的来源，并假设其能量密度随时间保持不变，也就是所谓的「宇宙常数（Λ）」。然而两项最新的大型国际合作计划，暗能量光谱仪（DESI）与暗能量调查（DES），其研究开始挑战这项假设，指出暗能量可能会随时间演化，进而动摇我们对宇宙膨胀的基本认识。根据 DESI 本身的资料分析，初步结果与标准宇宙模型 ΛCDM 基本一致。然而，当研究团队将这些观测结果进一步与宇宙微波背景辐射、超新星与弱重力透镜等其他观测资料结合时，发现暗能量的影响力可能随时间减弱，显示宇宙学常数可能并非真正的「常数」。目前的统计偏离程度为 2.8 至 4.2 个标准差，虽尚未达到物理学界公认的 5 个标准差门槛，但足以引起学术界的高度关注与讨论。",

Avey worked alongside Wojcicki and Paul Cusenza to launch the biotech company in Silicon Valley nearly twenty years ago. The company makes direct-to-consumer DNA test kits and explores genetic research. Avey served as co-president from 2006 to 2009 and remained a company board member until 2011.</p><p>In the post, Avey said the idea for 23andMe sparked after working in life science research for years.</p><p>&#34;A lightbulb went on &mdash; if I was interested in accessing my own data, wouldn&#39;t others feel the same way? Getting deeply personalized information about what makes us &#39;us&#39; seemed undeniable. It didn&#39;t take long for the concept to unfold,&#34; she said.</p><p>Avey said she pursued this goal under 23andMe until 2009, when her time at the company was &#34;cut short.&#34;</p><p>&#34;My time at the company was cut short in 2009, when my co-founder Anne convinced the board that she should run the company. And I must be honest, I was frustrated with the direction the company took after that point,&#34; Avey said. &#34;After my departure, she architected a majority vote for herself that eliminated board governance, even as the board expanded over the following funding rounds. For better or worse, the buck stopped with her. It came as no surprise when the board resigned last year.&#34;</p><p>Avey said that 23andMe &#34;was in a unique position&#34; initially, and it&#39;s &#34;painful to think what could have been.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The company has amassed one of the largest genetic data collections in the world, and to Anne&#39;s credit, created a terrific consumer brand. We can only imagine the importance of the dataset that could have been built, combining blood work, deeper gene sequencing, wearable data, and providing actionable insights,&#34; Avey said. &#34;Now, the market is fragmented with data siloed in many different companies.&#34;</p><p>Avey said 23andMe &#34;lost its way&#34; without &#34;consumer-focused product development&#34; and &#34;proper governance.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The 14+ million people who bought into the concept deserve to see their data moved to a secure platform with new leadership and vision,&#34; Avey said.</p><p>Avey rounded out her statement by emphasizing the importance of a balanced C-Suite.</p><p>&#34;There are many cautionary tales buried in the 23andMe story. Striking a balance between the desire for founder control and board oversight is essential; otherwise, why have a board at all?&#39; Avey said. &#34;It&#39;s a familiar trope in Silicon Valley that wealth translates into unquestionable business savvy. But no matter how great an idea, the importance of the dynamics of the founding team and their ability to listen to feedback is key.&#34;</p><p>Avey, Wojcicki, and representatives for 23andMe did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.</p><h2 id=\"2eb4d498-77d3-44ac-adb9-7acb0097f51c\" data-toc-id=\"2eb4d498-77d3-44ac-adb9-7acb0097f51c\"><strong>23andMe struggled before filing for bankruptcy</strong></h2><p>23andMe has weathered several storms since 2023.</p><p>Although <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-delete-your-23andme-data\">privacy concerns</a> have bogged down the company for years, criticism spiked that October over news that some user data had been compromised.

At most, the website had collected names, phone numbers, and emails for 300,000, the prosecutor said.</p><p>Instead, Javice and Amar &#34;generated fake data for 4 million people who did not exist&#34; and passed it off to the bank as real to clinch the deal and become multi-millionaires, he said. &#34;The names, phone numbers, emails? All were fake.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"fe04fe92-9b91-490f-ac53-1db9e6861977\" data-toc-id=\"fe04fe92-9b91-490f-ac53-1db9e6861977\">Users meant future bank customers, prosecutors say</h2><p>Prosecutors say Javice tricked bank executives into thinking that if they purchased Frank, they would become the new owners of the names, emails, and addresses of all 4 million of these Frank <em>users</em>, all of whom had used the site to at least begin filing out a federal financial aid form.</p><p>They were &#34;at the start of their financial journeys,&#34; the prosecutor said. JPMorgan could use Frank&#39;s data &mdash; those names and other contact information &mdash; to reach these &#34;users&#34; directly, selling them their very first checking accounts, credit cards, and car loans.</p><p>In five weeks of testimony, and in closing arguments Wednesday, lawyers for Javice sought to show that this is not what she had meant by <em>users</em> at all.</p><p>Instead, her lawyers say, she told the bank that 4 million people had merely visited the website and clicked around a bit, a number supported by Google Analytics.</p><p>There&#39;s no way the nation&#39;s largest bank would have ever believed that four million people had created Frank website accounts and begun filling out federal financial aid forms, Javice&#39;s lead defense lawyer, Jose Baez, told jurors.</p><p>&#34;If 4.25 million people went to that website, there&#39;s no way they all filled out FAFSAs,&#34; Baez said, referring to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid filled out by 17 million students a year.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m going to tell you straight up &mdash; they knew,&#34; Baez said of the bank, which he said had conducted its own investigation into Frank. &#34;They knew exactly what they were buying,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;&#39;User&#39; means many things, including a website visitor,&#34; read a slide used in closing arguments for Amar. His defense lawyer, Matthew I. Menchel, complained to jurors that prosecutors are unfairly trying to &#34;lump together&#34; Amar and Javice.</p><p>Amar was out of the loop for what prosecutors are calling key moments in their alleged conspiracy and actually urged that some incorrect traffic statistics be corrected during negotiations, the lawyer argued.</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s inconsistent with someone who is trying to defraud somebody, and it&#39;s inconsistent with their working together,&#34; Menchel told jurors.</p><h2 id=\"685a0bd2-71d6-4a76-b8bf-1029d080d80d\" data-toc-id=\"685a0bd2-71d6-4a76-b8bf-1029d080d80d\">JPMorgan wanted Javice, not her data</h2><p>Throughout five weeks of testimony, Javice&#39;s defense lawyers have pushed the theory that she was a young and promising microfinance star. The bank wanted her, not her data, and only cried &#34;fraud&#34; months later out of buyer&#39;s remorse, Baez told jurors Wednesday.</p><p>Baez, who delivered closing statements as lead lawyer in the acquittal of Casey Anthony, frequently used humor to convince jurors it was laughable to think JPMorgan Chase was ever bamboozled.</p><p>&#34;Somebody robbed the bank!&#34; he mocked, of the bank&#39;s reaction in firing Javice and shuttering Frank a year after the merger. &#34;It was Charlie the Kid!&#34;</p><p>At another point, Baez joked that to JPMorgan, $175 million was &#34;Not a lot of money at all. This was Monopoly money.&#34;</p><p>And who was the banker the Monopoly game was based on, he asked hypothetically, answering his own question to laughter in the courtroom: &#34;JPMorgan himself.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"e7513917-706e-48fe-b1cc-7006c24760cf\" data-toc-id=\"e7513917-706e-48fe-b1cc-7006c24760cf\">The definition of &#39;user&#39;</h2><p>A central dispute in front of jurors &mdash; as they listened to closing arguments by attorneys for the government, for Javice, and for her co-defendant &mdash; is this: How did Javice, 32, and Amar, 50, define &#34;user&#34; in negotiations with JPMorgan? As a nameless clicker? Or as a potential Chase customer whom the bank could email and text?</p><p>US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein raised this question in court on Tuesday as part of his preparation for instructing the jury on the law before deliberations.</p><p>&#34;What about the argument that by telling Chase that &#39;We have 4.25 million users,&#39; that they were telling the truth?&#34; he asked Georgia Kostopoulos, an assistant US attorney.</p><p>&#34;It was a lie,&#34; the prosecutor quickly answered.</p><p>&#34;But we have a number exactly the same as the number of users that visited the website,&#34; the judge pushed, referring to the Google Analytics total. &#34;And they&#39;re called <em>users</em>.&#34;</p><p>Kostopoulos countered that both Javice and Amar were present at a July 21, 2021, meeting where Javice assured JPMorgan executives that a user was someone who had provided Frank with their name and other personal identifying information as part of signing up for a website account.</p><p>The judge limited closing arguments to two hours per side.</p><p>The government presented its arguments first, followed by Javice&#39;s. After lunch, jurors heard arguments on behalf of Amar, followed by a brief rebuttal statement by the government. </p><p>The two co-defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, along with separate counts of wire, bank, and securities fraud. They face potential maximum sentences of 30 years in prison.</p><p><em>March 26, 2025: This story was updated throughout the day on Wednesday to include details from daylong closing arguments.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-javice-trial-closings-one-word-will-play-starring-role-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Perhaps Tony Stark never got the chance to step up as a hero and chose a darker path in that world.</p><p>There have also been versions of Iron Man in the comics that have turned into Doom.

What are they doing? I&#39;ve got to see this. Even if I just want to be able to have an opinion on why.&#39; I get it from a business perspective, I can&#39;t really see the downside,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;Fans would&#39;ve expected big things from an &#39;Avengers&#39; movie anyway,&#34; he added. &#34;And of course, this is the &#39;Avengers&#39; movie prior to &#39;Secret Wars.&#39;&#34;</p><p>Mitchell noted that people&#39;s curiosity about Downey&#39;s role in &#34;Doomsday&#34; and &#34;Secret Wars&#34; will draw them in, especially to see if the actor changes his appearance.</p><p>&#34;Will he look like Tony Stark or will they do something to make him look different? It&#39;s Hollywood, there&#39;s plenty of makeup. There&#39;s lots of Ryan Reynolds in &#39;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#39; but they don&#39;t all look the same.&#34;</p><p>Downey Jr.&#39;s casting comes amid conversations about whether audiences are tired of the superhero genre. While it&#39;s not a new concern, Mitchell said that MCU fatigue hasn&#39;t deterred fans.</p><p>&#34;Can we really have a conversation about MCU fatigue when &#39;Deadpool&#39; just made $430 million in four days? This is a film that we are anticipating being only the second R rated film to do a billion dollars. And clearly, that&#39;s where it&#39;s heading. So you can talk MCU fatigue after that,&#34; he said.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">&#39;Avengers: Doomsday&#39; and &#39;Avengers: Secret Wars&#39; will likely focus on a multiversal war.</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/66a783361a227600e63250b5?format=jpeg\" height=\"1196\" width=\"1595\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange in &#34;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.&#34;\"/><figcaption>In &#34;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,&#34; Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is warned that universes in the multiverse can collide.<p class=\"copyright\">Marvel Studios</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide-content\"><p>Michael Waldron, who wrote &#34;Loki,&#34; will be writing the script for the two Avengers movies, which means the film will likely be related to that series.</p><p>&#34;Loki,&#34; &#34;What If,&#34; &#34;<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-unanswered-questions-2022-5\">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a>,&#34; and &#34;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&#34; warned that multiversal interactions could lead to a war between universes or the universes colliding into each other.</p><p>Though Kang is no longer Marvel&#39;s big-picture villain, a collision between different worlds still seems to be the Avengers-level threat that will be faced in the next two films.</p><p>Marvel Studios seems to be adapting two major events from its 2015 and 2016 comics, &#34;Time Runs out&#34; and &#34;Secret Wars. In this run of comics, both written by Jonathan Hickman, the multiverse is dying because an alien race called the Beyonders has created living bombs to wipe out everything.</p><p>Attempts to kill living bombs lead to multiple earths from these universes colliding, wiping out both universes. The Beyonders&#39; plan succeeds, but Doctor Doom, Doctor Strange, and Molecule Man kill the alien race, steal their power, and create a new world with Doom as the world&#39;s god.</p><p>Other heroes also survive the decimation using special life raft machines. When they escape, they defeat Doom and restore the universe.</p><p>Incursions have already been alluded to in &#34;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.&#34; While they have the same effect as the comic book, the cause is prolonged multiversal traveling.</p><p>It is likely that something before or during &#34;Avengers: Doomsday&#34; kicks off that incursion in the main MCU universe, leading to a battle between multiple worlds. So fans may see even more cameos in the movie outside Downey Jr.&#39;s Doom from one of the other worlds.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">The Avengers team will look very different.</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/66a783c81a227600e63250d1?format=jpeg\" height=\"1663\" width=\"2218\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Pedro Pascal, and Vanessa Kirby stand next to each other at San Diego Comic Con in July 2024.\"/><figcaption>The cast of &#34;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&#34; &mdash;&nbsp;Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Pedro Pascal, and Vanessa Kirby &mdash; will appear in &#34;Avengers: Doomsday.&#34;<p class=\"copyright\">Gilbert Flores / Variety via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide-content\"><p>Since &#34;Avengers: Endgame,&#34; many of the main heroes from previous films have retired or died, and new characters have been introduced to the MCU through various films and Disney+ shows.</p><p>In March 2025, Marvel confirmed that &#34;Avengers: Doomsday&#34; is now in production.

Similarly, autonomous vehicles need to function independently of a mobile connection, raising questions about the need for 5G to begin with.</p><p>However, more recent reports mentioning 5G take a different tack &mdash; downgrading from bold claims like ultraconvenient &#34;smart cities&#34; to 5G-enabled drones that can monitor for insurance fraud.</p><div id=\"1743023421895\" data-styles=\"default-width\" data-embed-type=\"custom\" data-script=\"\" class=\"insider-raw-embed\" data-type=\"embed\"><div style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/VHt8tOoB-puACk8ZV.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute;\" allow=\"fullscreen\" title=\"5G disappointed consumers and phone carriers.

Building out the 5G network in the US has required hundreds of billions of dollars of investment.</p><p>To cut costs, much of the early 5G infrastructure was built by tweaking existing 4G sites. This approach, known as non-standalone 5G, offers efficiency but delivers a 4G-like experience.</p><p>Another thing that was supposed to be really different about 5G was the introduction of millimeter waves, which can theoretically provide much greater capacity. They are useful in select locations where crowds really pack in like stadiums or airports.</p><p>But in general, the distance they travel is so short and these waves are so easily blocked that widespread use in mobile networks just hasn&#39;t made a lot of sense, and many smartphones don&#39;t even support them.</p><p>It&#39;s not all bad news. When phones are actually connected to a 5G network, they generally get faster speeds and lower latency.</p><p>The thing is that for most people and most purposes, <em>4G </em>was already good enough.</p><p>Coverage &mdash; not speed &mdash; is one of the biggest problems we still face.</p><h2 id=\"c72e3986-2a40-4ff7-acfc-9af99a0ff74b\" data-toc-id=\"c72e3986-2a40-4ff7-acfc-9af99a0ff74b\" class=\"mb-xs mt-5 text-base font-[525] first:mt-3\"><strong>The Coverage Divide</strong></h2><p>In the US, coverage is patchy or nonexistent in many remote or rural areas.</p><p>Carriers simply haven&#39;t built their networks out in a lot of these places, often because there aren&#39;t enough paying customers living there to justify the investment. This is part of what&#39;s called the &#34;digital divide.&#34;</p><p>The defining feature of 5G is its higher, shorter-range frequencies. If the top priority was expanding coverage, building out existing 4G to more places networks would have been more efficient than upgrading so much existing 4G infrastructure in cities.</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever seen a TV ad about 5G, then you might now be a little confused because the maps they show tend to make it look like 5G is already nearly everywhere.</p><p>Douglas Dawson has tested cellphone speeds across the country for his telecommunication consulting firm, CCG, and found that 5G only covers 30% to 40% of the land area in most US counties.</p><p>&#34;People have trouble even making a cellphone call &mdash; 4G or 5G &mdash; because towers only have a limited circle around them of coverage,&#34; he said.</p><p>We asked the 3 major US carriers for comment on the accuracy of their maps.</p><p>Only T-Mobile answered the question directly. &#34;Coverage Maps provide a general service expectation; it&#39;s not flawless,&#34; a spokesperson said.</p><p>Users may see a 5G icon on their phones even when not connected to a 5G network.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/24/5g-phone-signal-bars-meaning-iphone-android/\">The Washington Post </a>reported that, in the US, the icon just means that a mobile network is nearby and not necessarily that you&#39;re connected to it.</p><p>We asked all major US carriers about this, too.</p><p>AT&amp;T said the 5G icon appears where the technology is available. T-Mobile said their icon is always accurate, and Verizon didn&#39;t get back to us.</p><p>A 2024 industry report showed that Verizon and AT&amp;T 5G users were connected to a 5G network only about one-tenth of the time.</p><p>This is despite the fact that the US wireless industry has built nearly 100,000 new cell sites since 2018.</p><p>It&#39;s no surprise that carriers amplified the hype. They invested an enormous amount of money into it.</p><h2 id=\"552dc911-a516-40f6-a149-37fc74637494\" data-toc-id=\"552dc911-a516-40f6-a149-37fc74637494\" class=\"mb-xs mt-5 text-base font-[525] first:mt-3\"><strong>The Costly Reality</strong></h2><p>The three major US phone carriers spent over $100 billion on licenses to use the frequencies.</p><p>That doesn&#39;t include the cost of upgrading 4G sites to 5G or of building tons of new cell sites, which has required billions <em>more </em>dollars in investment.</p><p>However, they have struggled to monetize 5G, with monthly phone bills decreasing because of competition. The average revenue per user has been trending downwards even as investment from carriers has risen, putting them in a difficult position.</p><h2 id=\"37f53fea-a0bc-437a-9552-5ebd60f71eca\" data-toc-id=\"37f53fea-a0bc-437a-9552-5ebd60f71eca\" class=\"mb-xs mt-5 text-base font-[525] first:mt-3\"><strong>The Race</strong></h2><p>Because telecommunications is of massive economic and social importance equipment vendors &mdash; those who sell the actual infrastructure like antennas &mdash; and industry trade groups can lobby government officials, telling them that the next generation will be essential and transformative &mdash; and that if they don&#39;t act quickly, they might miss out on the benefits.</p><p>This pressure contributed to the narrative that the US and other nations were engaged in a global &#34;5G race.&#34;</p><p>In turn, politicians who are most likely not telecoms engineering experts but might also be eager to implement new infrastructure projects see this as a no-risk position. Who wouldn&#39;t want to align themselves with the next frontier of technological innovation?</p><p>This rush could have resulted in many of these problems, including the decision to start with non-standalone 5G networks, and the the failure of 5G to differentiate itself from 4G in the eyes of consumers.</p><p>But 5G was also rushed in the planning phase.</p><p>Developing a plan for a new generation usually takes about 10 years, but 5G was rushed out in just eight. This was partially because of global political pressure, and because Japan planned a splashy 5G debut for the 2020 Olympics, even though it ended up delayed a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><h2 id=\"39c4c0f8-16d8-4cdf-bec3-053615c1dcf7\" data-toc-id=\"39c4c0f8-16d8-4cdf-bec3-053615c1dcf7\" class=\"mb-xs mt-5 text-base font-[525] first:mt-3\"><strong>Looking Ahead: 6G and Beyond</strong></h2><p>It&#39;s possible that 5G will be a continuation of a pattern established by previous networks.</p><p>The odd generations &mdash; 1G and 3G &mdash; were somewhat disappointing, but the even generations that followed worked out the kinks and had greater benefits.</p><p>So we could see bigger transformations with 6G.</p><p>But as we get closer to the sixth generation, most experts Business Insider spoke to said it&#39;s on the same troubled path.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-5g-failed-to-change-the-world-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

More often than not, I make sourdough focaccia instead of a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-tips-start-making-sourdough-bread-at-home\">typical sourdough loaf</a>.</p><p>There are a few reasons. As an <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sourdough-bread-easy-baking-method-tips\">unserious sourdough baker</a>, it&#39;s a recipe that&#39;s hard to mess up.

Too dense means your bread might be inedible.</p><p>Out of fear of a bad loaf, I tend to rest my dough too long (or sometimes forget about it altogether).</p><p>This has led to doughs with excessive bubbles and expansion. You can tell when your dough might not make the ideal sourdough loaf when it&#39;s more than doubled in size and large bubbles are seen throughout the surface of the dough.</p><p>While it might not make the best sourdough loaf, this is the ideal dough for focaccia.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">Before committing to focaccia, try to shape your loaf.</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e4371e63d72727e1984da7?format=jpeg\" height=\"4480\" width=\"6720\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A relatively flat loaf of sourdough bread.\"/><figcaption>A flat loaf of sourdough bread.<p class=\"copyright\">Ali Majdfar/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide-content\"><p>If you were set on making a sourdough loaf, don&#39;t give up just because your dough looks slightly wrong.</p><p>My advice is to go ahead and try to shape the dough into a loaf. I do this for a few reasons. First, it&#39;s practice at shaping. Second, it&#39;s one of the best signs of whether you must resort to focaccia.</p><p>If you shape your dough and it falls flat and refuses to hold a round, firm shape, then you know you should probably pop it in a pan and make focaccia.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">The focaccia recipe is simple.</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e437db69253ccddf9a5b79?format=jpeg\" height=\"2048\" width=\"1536\" charset=\"\" alt=\"The author&#39;s active sourdough starter.\"/><figcaption>The reporter&#39;s active sourdough starter.<p class=\"copyright\">Monica Humphries/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide-content\"><p>I use the same recipe for baking a sourdough loaf and focaccia. <span>It comes from this TikToker and self-described sourdough enthusiast named </span><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@casacalifano?lang=en\"><span>Jackie</span></a> and calls for 500 grams of bread flour, 375 grams of water, 11 grams of salt, and 100 grams of active sourdough starter.</p><p>If you&#39;re setting out to make focaccia, you can skip all the confusing stretch and folds and just mix the ingredients and let it sit.</p><p>How long you let it sit depends on your home&#39;s temperature, but typically, you need to let it rest for more than eight hours. You can also toss the dough in the fridge overnight to bake the next morning.</p><p>Once it&#39;s rested and doubled, toss it in a pan with olive oil and dimple the dough. Then, you wait another three or four hours before baking.</p><p>This is where focaccia is simple: don&#39;t stress about timing. If you wait six hours instead of four, your dough will likely be fine. </p><p>You&#39;re ultimately looking for a rested dough that has plenty of bubbles.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">If you&#39;re a sourdough beginner, focaccia is ideal.</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e4393169253ccddf9a5bb6?format=jpeg\" height=\"1152\" width=\"1536\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A loaf of sourdough sits on a food scale.\"/><figcaption>A scale is helpful to measure our ingredients for a sourdough recipe.<p class=\"copyright\">Monica Humphries/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide-content\"><p>I wish I had known how easy it was to make focaccia when I started my sourdough journey.</p><p>I waited months before using my starter because I didn&#39;t have a Dutch oven or the right tools to make a sourdough loaf.</p><p>Making sourdough focaccia doesn&#39;t require any special equipment. A scale is handy but not necessary since you can find recipes using cups online. Plus, you can bake focaccia in a brownie pan, sheet tray, or whatever you have handy.</p><p>It&#39;s also a bread that&#39;s harder to mess up, which means you&#39;ll have delicious bread and more confidence to continue baking sourdough.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">Focaccia is my go-to if I&#39;m experimenting with toppings and flavors.</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e4388769253ccddf9a5b8d?format=jpeg\" height=\"2048\" width=\"1536\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A savory and sweet sourdough focaccia.\"/><figcaption>A savory and sweet sourdough focaccia.<p class=\"copyright\">Monica Humphries/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide-content\"><p>One of the reasons I love focaccia is how easy it is to add toppings.</p><p>There are several methods for incorporating flavors and inclusions into a sourdough loaf.</p><p>For example, if I made a jalapeño cheddar loaf, some bakers would add the peppers and cheese during the stretch and fold process, while others would add them during the shaping process.</p><p>This has led to issues. Sometimes, the toppings are concentrated in one part of the loaf, and I don&#39;t get an even spread of flavor. Other times, I&#39;ve been completely wrong with the balance of flavors and got stuck with an undesired loaf.</p><p>For focaccia, I tend to add flavors to the top and incorporate them using my fingers, producing a consistent amount of ingredients throughout an entire loaf.</p><p>I also love focaccia because experimenting with flavors is much easier. I can section a loaf into four corners and try four different flavor combinations in one bake.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">Finally, I tend to keep my dough thick to use it for sandwiches.</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e434ecb8b41a9673fbc151?format=jpeg\" height=\"1152\" width=\"1536\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A thick slice of sourdough focaccia.\"/><figcaption>A thick slice of sourdough focaccia.<p class=\"copyright\">Monica Humphries/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide-content\"><p>Focaccia tends to be a thinner, bubblier bread.</p><p>Since I typically use my sourdough for sandwiches throughout the week, I make sure my focaccia dough is thick.</p><p>I pick a smaller pan with higher walls and don&#39;t spread the dough too much, leaving me with a thick bread that&#39;s easy to cut and use for my meals.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">The result is a bubbly, crispy bread without the stress of a typical sourdough loaf.</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67e43b1db8b41a9673fbc270?format=jpeg\" height=\"2048\" width=\"1536\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Sourdough focaccia.\"/><figcaption>Sourdough focaccia.<p class=\"copyright\">Monica Humphries/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide-content\"><p>My focaccia bread receives the most compliments. It&#39;s hard to find fault in a loaf soaked in salt and olive oil.</p><p>And considering just how easy it is to make and bake, it&#39;s the main reason I&#39;m whipping up sourdough focaccia more often than a typical sourdough loaf.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sourdough-focaccia-bread-baking-tips\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Again to take responsibility and to ensure this can never happen again.&#34;</p><p>On Tuesday evening, Michael Waltz, the White House national security advisor who&#39;s at the center of the scandal, said Musk had offered his assistance in figuring out what happened. It&#39;s the latest role for Musk, President <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a>&#39;s self-described &#34;tech support&#34; and the de facto <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-agencies-musk-doge-targeted-list-2025-2\">DOGE office</a> leader.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re going to get to the bottom of it.

But I can tell you, I can tell you for 100% I don&#39;t know this guy.&#34;</p><p>While serving as a White House senior advisor, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-stock-absentee-ceos-silent-epidemic-2025-3\">Musk has remained chief executive of Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI.</a></p><p>Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, published a bombshell report on Tuesday detailing how he had been inadvertently added to a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/signal-group-chat-houthis-hegseth-vance-war-personalities-explained-2025-03\">Signal group chat</a> that discussed details of a planned US strike on Houthi rebels. Since then, the White House has tried to downplay the details discussed in a chat that included officials as high up as Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>On Wednesday, after Trump said no classified information was disclosed in the chat, Goldberg published screenshots of messages that showed <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/veterans-roast-trump-officials-with-signal-memes-2025-3\">Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</a> naming specific times and weapon systems that would be used. The White House and Pentagon said the airstrikes were successful.</p><p>Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, which oversees the Pentagon, said his panel is asking an inspector general to probe the matter. Trump recently fired the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general, essentially a watchdog within the government, though the role has been filled on a temporary basis.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear what kind of technical expertise would be necessary to investigate the situation. Goldberg&#39;s screenshots show Waltz adding him to the chat. Signal, a secure messaging platform, allows users to add participants to a group chat.

Unemployment has ticked up slightly from 3.9% a year ago to 4.1% now. And while DOGE layoffs didn&#39;t lead to a spike in unemployment claims in February, they could start showing up in next month&#39;s data, according to Shruti Mishra, an economist at Bank of America. Uncertainty around DOGE and tariffs could also lead some employers to pause hiring, Mishra added.</p><p>The choppy economic environment doesn&#39;t paint a rosy picture for those who are looking for a new job. However, it hasn&#39;t deterred some people &mdash; namely, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-employee-workplace-job-hop-career-change-tips-retirement-2025-3\">Gen Z workers</a>. In fact, the prevalence of layoffs might further incentivize some workers to start recruiting.</p><p>&#34;The sentiment that I&#39;m hearing from clients is &#39;I don&#39;t really feel a lot of stability,&#39; and so that loyalty to a company for any given amount of time or reason is just less relevant because no one feels like they&#39;re getting that loyalty from the employer side,&#34; Lemonik said.</p><p>Here&#39;s the advice Lemonik gives her clients who are looking for jobs right now.</p><h2 id=\"6d51c202-a124-42fc-aa12-f5df7b441569\" data-toc-id=\"6d51c202-a124-42fc-aa12-f5df7b441569\"><strong>Be prepared</strong></h2><p>Lemonik&#39;s clients are exercising more caution in today&#39;s job market than they did in previous years.</p><p>Last year, it wasn&#39;t uncommon for Lemonik to see burnt-out clients quit their jobs with nothing lined up.</p><p>&#34;Even a year ago, I felt like I was working with more people that were like, &#39;I&#39;m really burned out at my job, and if I don&#39;t have another job in 3 months, I think I&#39;m still going to take a break,&#39;&#34; Lemonik said.</p><p>Now, she&#39;s seeing more hesitation from her clients. &#34;It&#39;s less so that people are gripping to the job that they have, but more so that they&#39;re not willing to take that risk of leaving without another job,&#34; Lemonik added.</p><p>One of the most common questions Lemonik&#39;s clients ask her when they interview for jobs is how they can determine if the job is safe from layoffs.</p><p>The biggest takeaway that Lemonik shared? You can&#39;t definitively predict if a job is &#34;stable&#34; or &#34;safe.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I think we all have to have some stability within ourselves in the way that we build our own career paths and financial safety nets because you can&#39;t put your stability or safety in any employer. This is my honest take that I give people,&#34; Lemonik told BI.</p><p>That&#39;s why it can be helpful to build up an emergency fund and evaluate your current budget to see where you can cut back on spending. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-prepare-for-recession-economy-personal-finance-economic-crash-2025-3\">Upskilling</a> and investing in your career can also be ways to negotiate your salary at your next job and preserve job security in an economic downturn.</p><h2 id=\"8253395f-6a8b-4c18-af53-d46611bd09cd\" data-toc-id=\"8253395f-6a8b-4c18-af53-d46611bd09cd\"><strong>Ask smart interview questions</strong></h2><p>Lemonik tells her clients to take advantage of the opportunity to do their due diligence on a job when hiring managers ask, &#34;Do you have any questions for me?&#34;</p><p>&#34;Could this be a department that&#39;s cut? Is this a smart type of role to be getting? Are these the first people out when there&#39;s no more budget left? These are the things people are trying to figure out,&#34; Lemonik said.</p><p>Asking the interviewer certain questions at the end of the interview can give you insights into how insulated the role is from economic volatility. Lemonik recommends asking about the direction of the company, as well as situational questions about how the company has dealt with challenges in the past.</p><p>She provided the following examples:</p><ul><li>&#34;I saw online that you guys are going through your Series E funding. I&#39;d love to know what the biggest goal is for the coming year on the team, and if there are any obstacles to that goal, how you are currently handling them.&#34;</li><li>&#34;I&#39;d love to hear how you&#39;ve handled a challenging time within the company in the past, and how you&#39;ve helped your team rise above and maintain its culture as much as possible.&#34;</li></ul><p>These questions allow you to examine if the role you&#39;re interviewing for has long-term growth potential. They also highlight what to expect from company leadership.</p><p>&#34;I think anything you can do to explore how the leaders of the company operate when things are not as certain is a good indicator of how the company is going to react to potentially inevitable changes,&#34; Lemonik said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/career-coach-advice-job-hunting-potential-recession-labor-market-interview-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

    "description": "Tokyo Gas had cut back on its previously high shareholder returns to fund long-term growth investments. (Photo by Kosuke Imamura) Utility readies $800m buyback as battery, shale gas investments raise profit concerns SHINO KATAYAMA March 27, 2025 07:05 JST TOKYO — Tokyo Gas will repurchase up to 120 billion yen ($800 million) in stock during the first half of fiscal 2025, the utility said Wednesday, in a shift back toward shareholder returns as major growth investments have struggled to&nbsp;bear fruit. The full amount would match the record 120 billion yen in buybacks the Japanese utility&nbsp;conducted in all of fiscal 2024, and do so in half the time. Tokyo Gas said it will consider further buybacks in the second half “based on company performance,” and raised its annual dividend for fiscal 2024 by 10 yen per share to 80 yen. “Though long-term growth is important to us, we cannot meet stakeholders’ expectations unless we focus to some extent on short-term economics,” President Shinichi Sasayama said in a briefing, adding that the company will “sincerely face” skepticism about its ability to achieve its fiscal 2025 target of 8% return on equity. A disclosure released last fall showed Elliott Investment Management owned&nbsp;more than 5% of Tokyo Gas. The&nbsp;activist investor has been pressuring the company to sell assets and return money to shareholders, a source familiar with the situation said. Once known for its high returns for shareholders, Tokyo Gas changed tack over the past few years, with Sasayama saying “we want to give back to shareholders through sustainable growth.” In fiscal 2020, the utility changed its shareholder payout ratio policy, lowering the target from around 60% to roughly 40% by fiscal 2023. Meanwhile, the company&nbsp;has outlined plans to spend 650 billion yen on growth investments in the three years through fiscal 2025, up from 475.8 billion yen in the preceding three years. During this pivot, Tokyo Gas invested in areas such as storage batteries and North American shale gas development, but has yet to see notable successes. Its return on assets, based on adjusted ordinary profit, came to 4.2% last fiscal year, 3.8 percentage points lower than in fiscal 2012. “Investment in fossil fuels makes money in the short term, but there’s a lot of uncertainty over the medium to long term,” an analyst said. “Investments in renewable energy and decarbonization are likely to become profitable in the medium to long term, but don’t make money now — they’re tough.” Tokyo Gas has pared its shareholder returns to keep funding investments with a long time horizon. Its domestic city gas business, which generates steady profits, has become a smaller part of the portfolio. S&amp;P Global Ratings in November downgraded its outlook on the company’s long-term bonds from “stable” to “negative,” citing concerns about the possible impact of that shift on earnings and cash flow. Tokyo Gas is considering ways to boost profit&nbsp;while limiting outlays, such as acquiring usage rights to power generation and storage facilities owned by other companies. The utility plans to boost return on assets by divesting at least 100 billion yen in assets between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2028.",

The tariffs will be charged in addition to ones that are already in place.

    "description": "Uchida will become the first GPIF head to hail from one of Japan's top banks. (Source photos by Nikkei) Kazuto Uchida has experience managing funds, working overseas Nikkei staff writers March 27, 2025 05:33 JST TOKYO — Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) will have a bank veteran with extensive experience on the front line of fund management as its new chief next month. Former Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Director Kazuto Uchida will assume the top post at GPIF on April 1. “He has ample specialized knowledge and experience,” said Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare Takamaro Fukuoka at a Tuesday press conference announcing the appointment. Uchida will be the first GPIF head to hail from one of Japan’s top banks since the fund was established in 2006. GPIF, one of the world’s largest institutional investors, manages premiums paid to the country’s National Pension and Employees’ Pension Insurance system, with managed assets reaching 258 trillion yen ($1.71 trillion) at the end of 2024. It is often called a “whale” due to its investments’ sway on the market.&nbsp; Uchida joined Mitsubishi Bank — now MUFG Bank — in 1985 and has long been involved in fund management. He was head of the section responsible for investing in yen assets, mainly Japanese government bonds. He also served as head of the market department, overseeing fund investment both at home and overseas for two years. He also served as chairman of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “He provides balanced and neutral analysis of the market and the economy in general,” said Nomura Research Institute’s executive economist Takahide Kiuchi, who knows Uchida well. “He is knowledgeable about banking in general and has management experience.” SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Hidenori Suezawa noted that Uchida “has an international background, having worked in the U.S.” He is expected to tackle two goals: securing investment returns and strengthening the organization. GPIF’s investment returns have been strong, with assets under management increasing&nbsp;50% in the five years from the end of 2019 to the end of 2024. Success in pension asset management is judged by the effective yield — the difference&nbsp;between the rate of returns and the pace of nominal wage increases. GPIF’s stated target is 1.7%, with its actual results from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2023 averaging 4.24% per year. The welfare ministry will raise the effective yield target to 1.9% from fiscal 2025. Many companies have announced wage increases, and nominal wage growth is expected to accelerate. As Japanese interest rates rise above zero amid inflation, GPIF is expected to produce higher returns. Securing workers is also an issue. As assets under management increase, the skills required for investment and risk management also become more advanced.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Asia-needs-to-ensure-power-grids-are-in-step-with-renewables-growth",
    "description": "Technicians work to install a high voltage electric&nbsp;transmission&nbsp;line at the substation of Gujarat Solar Park in Gujarat, India on Sept, 12, 2024. © Reuters Upgrades are needed to unlock the full potential of wind and solar power projects Vandana Hari Vandana Hari March 27, 2025 05:05 JST Vandana Hari is founder of Vanda Insights, a Singapore-based global energy market intelligence provider. The recent boom in wind and solar power generation capacity has been hailed as a promising low-carbon solution to the world’s growing demand for energy, with governments doubling down on renewables as part of their net-zero emission targets. But a gaping hole has opened up in the execution of this strategy. Electricity grids around the world are struggling to integrate new solar and wind power projects — and the continued rapid growth in the latter will only make the situation worse. About 1,650 gigawatts of wind and solar projects in advanced stages of development around the world were waiting for grid connections as of July 2024, the International Energy Agency said in a February report. To put that in context, that figure is equivalent to around 52% of the current wind and solar capacity installed across the globe. Major developing economies in Asia are especially vulnerable to the downside of the growing disconnect between renewable power generation capacity and grid capacity due to multiple factors: A relatively high rate of urbanization spurring strong demand growth for power; the need for affordable, stable and accessible universal supply; rapidly growing reliance on oil and gas imports; and grid systems that are mostly government dominated. Investment in power transmission — the network of high-voltage power lines, substations, transformers and other infrastructure that moves electricity from power plants to the distribution networks that reach the final consumers — is woefully inadequate around the world, according to the IEA, but especially faces major funding gaps in developing economies. Countries looking to expand and upgrade their grids are also facing steep price hikes and long waits to get the critical components. On the supply side, there are limited equipment manufacturers globally, who in turn are struggling with supply chain bottlenecks, cost escalations and a shortage of skilled labor, leading to massive backlogs. Lead times for power transformers have doubled to four years and prices have rocketed 75% since 2019, while the waiting time for high-voltage cables has risen to three years and prices have nearly doubled since 2019, the IEA found. Grid integration is challenging for wind and solar projects because they are typically located in remote or rural areas, selected on the basis of access to land and sunlight or strong wind flows. As a result, they need the setting up of long-distance transmission networks — with the added complexity of underwater sea cables in the case of offshore wind — to deliver electricity to the grid. In contrast, coal- or gas-fired power plants are typically built near consumption centers, making them relatively easier to connect with existing high-voltage transmission networks. Intermittency in wind and solar projects — the loss of power output when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine — needs balancing mechanisms such as battery storage or pumped hydro, and “smart grid” systems that can allow grid operators to anticipate and manage the fluctuations, all of which also needs considerable investment. China has built an industry to produce the full array of transmission and distribution system components but is using much of its manufacturing capacity to serve galloping domestic demand, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. China added about 277 GW of new solar capacity in 2024, a 45% jump from 2023, and 80 GW of wind capacity for an increase of 18%. Southeast Asian countries, endowed with rich wind and solar power resources, need to avoid the trap of pursuing only one part of the renewables build-out equation while increasing their import dependency on an already stretched grid components sector. Workers install&nbsp;solar&nbsp;panels on Tseng Tien-fu’s vanilla&nbsp;farm&nbsp;in Taoyuan, Taiwan on&nbsp;May 30, 2022. &nbsp; © Reuters As the IEEFA puts it, solar panels and wind turbines are “the most identifiable symbols of the energy transition,” and Southeast Asian governments have encouraged and even mandated local production of these components. At the same time, downstream policy incentives have stimulated fund inflows into construction of wind and solar power plants. But the electricity grid appears to have been neglected. Governments in the region need to heed growing calls from prominent energy policy and research organizations to create fully grid-integrated supply projects and localize grid equipment supply chains. “Investment in transmission equipment production could be pivotal in ensuring energy security, reliability and availability,” according to the IEEFA. The International Renewable Energy Agency has urged Southeast Asian countries to invest in modernizing and expanding grid infrastructure, with a focus on adopting advanced technologies for grid flexibility and energy storage systems needed to accommodate the growing share of wind and solar power generation. In most countries in the region — with the exception of the Philippines — state-owned enterprises control power transmission and often also have a monopoly or dominant role in power generation and distribution, with governments regulating electricity tariffs. Policymakers need to quickly figure out ways to manage the dichotomy between power grids as a legacy state-owned and state-managed part of the electricity ecosystem and the demands of private sector-led, fast-growing wind and solar generation. Whether it is done through state funding or with the help of private investment, the expansion, upgradation and modernization of power grids through digitalization needs to be prioritized. On the flip side, not doing so in time may spur an irreversible exodus of investors from wind and solar projects. Policymakers need to find ways to catalyze local manufacturing of power grid components. It could be done at a national level, or through overseas joint ventures with existing players and financing from multilateral development banks. A good starting point would be to bring the boring but critical backbone of power grids to the fore in policymaking and industry discussions, regionally and internationally. While renewables and other forms of “green” power generation have become common on the agenda of oil and gas conferences in recent years, the grid has remained in the shadows. It’s encouraging to see the second-ever edition of the Astana International Forum in Kazakhstan, planned for May 29 and 30, which aims at finding solutions to the challenges of climate change, food shortages and energy security, dedicating a session exclusively to nations ensuring power supply stability amid the intermittency of renewables and supply chain issues. More conferences and seminars focused on the entire power sector ecosystem from generation to distribution are needed to facilitate the exchange of know-how and spur collaboration opportunities among industry players, policymakers, investors and think tanks. This has become critical if we are to prevent the wind and solar power bandwagon from decoupling and derailing.",

    "description": "Industry-based alliances working toward&nbsp;reaching net-zero emissions face headwinds as the Trump administration rolls back climate initiatives. © Reuters Industry climate initiative loses steam amid Trump rollbacks OKI HIDAKA and HARUKI KITAGAWA March 27, 2025 05:00 JST TOKYO — Tokio Marine Asset Management left an environmentally focused investor group at the end of February, Nikkei has learned, marking the first exit by a major Japanese player amid growing headwinds on global efforts to combat climate change. Tokio Marine Asset said it made the decision after reviewing the purpose of its membership, including whether participation in the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative was helping solve societal challenges. Tokio Marine Asset said it will not abandon contributions toward a creating decarbonized society. Other major Japanese asset managers, including Nomura Asset Management, Daiwa Asset Management and Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management, remained part of NZAM as of Wednesday. Sompo Asset Management, which like Tokio Marine Asset is a subsidiary of a nonlife insurance group, is still also part of the framework. Overseas, U.S.-based BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, exited NZAM in January, saying its membership “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” BlackRock has played a leading role in the sector’s efforts to address climate change risks. But Republican lawmakers have accused it of forcing green strategies on U.S. businesses. With U.S. President Donald Trump rolling back climate-related initiatives, BlackRock may be wary of drawing further criticism or losing business opportunities. Following BlackRock’s departure, NZAM said it would suspend activities while it reviews objectives and operations. It has also taken down its roster from the website. “Unless NZAM settles on its direction, we can’t decide on how we will respond as a company,” said an executive at a leading asset manager. Whether other Japanese players will follow Tokio Marine Asset remains to be seen. “We know there have been some departures overseas, but we can’t make the decision on our own since we manage assets belonging to other owners,” an industry insider said. “Depending on the situation, we may need to consider an exit,” said the head of one asset manager. In related fields, all three leading Japanese insurance groups, including Tokio Marine Asset’s parent, Tokio Marine Holdings, have exited the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Insurance Alliance. Six U.S. banks, including Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, as well as major Japanese players like Sumitomo Mitsui Banking , have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, another U.N.-backed group, since December.",

    "title": "Tesla to launch in Saudi Arabia as Musk and the kingdom mend relations",
    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Electric-vehicles/Tesla-to-launch-in-Saudi-Arabia-as-Musk-and-the-kingdom-mend-relations",
    "description": "Tesla&nbsp;sells in other Middle Eastern countries, but not in Saudi Arabia. © Reuters Sales start in April, five years after feud with PIF over taking automaker private March 27, 2025 04:11 JST RIYADH (Reuters) —&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;will start sales in Saudi Arabia next month, the electric carmaker said on its website, signaling CEO&nbsp;Elon Musk&nbsp;and the kingdom have healed a rift that dates back to the billionaire’s short-lived bid in 2018 to take the company private. Tesla&nbsp;sells in other Middle Eastern countries, but not in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf region’s largest market, where EVs only account for 1% of total car sales. The brand has had considerable success in neighboring United Arab Emirates, where most ride-hailing apps offer electric vehicles. The dispute started when Musk tweeted in 2018 he had “funding secured” to take&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;private after a meeting with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. That tweet eventually led to a lawsuit from investors when a bid failed to materialize, during which tense text messages between Musk and PIF head Yasir al-Rumayyan were made public. Tensions have eased since the autumn, when Musk took a high-profile role in U.S. President&nbsp;Donald Trump’s election campaign and then new administration. Trump said this month he would likely make his first trip abroad to Saudi Arabia, after asking the kingdom in January to spend upward&nbsp;of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy&nbsp;over four years, including military purchases. EVs from China’s BYD&nbsp;and PIF-backed Lucid&nbsp;are already available in the Saudi market. EV sales have been slow in Saudi Arabia, with a 2024 report from consultants PwC putting them at just 1% of all car sales. Tesla’s launch event in Riyadh, scheduled for April 10, will display its EVs and products powered by solar energy, the post said. “Experience the future of autonomous driving with Cybercab, and meet Optimus, our humanoid robot, as we showcase what’s next in AI and robotics,” it added. On April 11, it will open pop-up stores in Riyadh, Jeddah&nbsp;and Dammam,&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;said in a later statement, adding it would announce further details of its plans for Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks, with investment planned for 2025 and beyond. Invitations to the launch event asked guests to indicate which&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;car model they were interested in. A month after the feud with Musk went public, the PIF announced a $1-billion-plus investment in Lucid, becoming the majority investor in one of the EV startups looking to challenge&nbsp;Tesla. PIF, which has assets under management of $925 billion, has also invested in a domestic EV brand that is yet to launch called Ceer. Yet large, gas-guzzling vehicles remain the norm on Saudi roads where fuel is cheap and&nbsp;EV&nbsp;charging infrastructure remains a rarity, making traversing its long desert roads almost impossible in an EV. The launch comes as&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;has seen EV sales&nbsp;slump&nbsp;in Europe, blamed on Musk’s support for far right politicians, and the brand has been targeted by protesters in the United States over his spearheading of sweeping cuts to the federal government. In one of the first signs of improving relations, Musk appeared alongside Rumayyan and Trump in ringside seats at a UFC mixed martial arts match in New York in November. A few weeks earlier, Musk had made a surprise appearance at Riyadh’s Future Investment Initiative summit via video link. A U.S.&nbsp;jury&nbsp;found in 2023 that Musk was not liable for misleading investors when he tweeted funding was secured to take&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;private. Musk testified it was the PIF that had wanted to take&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;private when he posted that tweet, and a series of tense text messages between him and Rumayyan emerged during the case. “You are throwing me under the bus,” Musk wrote in a text to Rumayyan, according to court documents.

    "description": "Li Ka-shing might look like he is caught in the middle of a Donald Trump-Xi Jinping feud, but history shows he has a knack for maneuvering around&nbsp;politics and ahead of economic trends. (Nikkei montage/Source photos by Reuters and Yusuke Hinata) The Hong Kong tycoon's move comes as the U.S. and China ratchet up tensions KATSUJI NAKAZAWA KATSUJI NAKAZAWA March 27, 2025 04:00 JST Katsuji Nakazawa is a Tokyo-based senior staff and editorial writer at Nikkei. He spent seven years in China as a correspondent and later as China bureau chief. He was the 2014 recipient of the Vaughn-Ueda International Journalist prize. CK Hutchison founder Li Ka-shing has made his way back into the global spotlight by deciding to sell the rights to operate ports on either side of the Panama Canal, which has become a pain point in U.S.-China tensions. While the Hong Kong tycoon’s move might win him points in Washington, it has put him in Beijing’s crosshairs. But Li might not even feel the pressure. The 96-year-old billionaire has a well-established reputation for his ability to see what is likely to happen in the future and to take appropriate action. He is known to have correctly predicted a dramatic change in the Chinese real estate market and sold off many mainland assets before the country’s property bubble started to collapse in 2021. So has the man who has witnessed decades of fierce power struggles within the Chinese Communist Party made another prediction, one about U.S.-China relations? Li Ka-shing made inroads into China in the first half of the 1990s by deepening relationships with companies affiliated with the Ministry of Transport. &nbsp; © Reuters Exactly 30 years ago, Li learned firsthand the dark side of Chinese politics through his involvement in a huge development project in Wangfujing, a busy shopping district in central Beijing. Wangfujing is not far from Zhongnanhai, the country’s political nerve center where party leaders have their offices. On April 4, 1995, gunfire rang out in a suburb of Beijing, and Wang Baosen, Beijing’s then-most senior vice mayor, was found dead. It is said he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. Wang’s shocking death developed into a major corruption scandal that rocked Chinese politics. Shortly afterward, Chen Xitong, who was Beijing’s top official and a key member of the “Beijing faction,” was purged for corruption. Chen, who was a member of the party’s powerful Politburo, was eventually sentenced to 16 years in prison, and questions were later raised about whether his corruption charge had more to do with a serious crime. After the deadly Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy students in 1989, Jiang Zemin, then Shanghai’s top official, was suddenly tapped as the party’s general secretary. Jiang replaced Zhao Ziyang, who was purged in the wake of Tiananmen Square for showing a sympathetic attitude toward the protesting students. Jiang was “a new face” in Beijing. Although he had the backing of then-supreme leader Deng Xiaoping, his own political base was extremely weak. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng join a news conference at The&nbsp;Great Hall of the People in&nbsp;Beijing on Sept.&nbsp;26, 1989. Jiang became&nbsp;the party’s general secretary that year. &nbsp; © Reuters In essence, Chen’s downfall was the result of a dog-eat-dog power struggle within the party. Jiang, who led the “Shanghai faction,” drove Chen out to consolidate his power as the influential Beijing faction member had stood in his way. Chen’s corruption case involved Li’s massive development project in Wangfujing. Li must have felt his blood freeze as he was seen as being at the center of the case. But the case — in essence an outgrowth of a party power struggle — only impacted the Hong Kong tycoon temporarily. Li made inroads into China in the first half of the 1990s, after Tiananmen Square sparked harsh Western sanctions. He deepened his relationships with companies affiliated with the Ministry of Transport, including in the port and terminal business. Around the time of the 1995 corruption scandal involving Chen, Li began to forge an even closer relationship with Jiang, who won his power struggle and cemented his position as successor to the aged Deng. Connections to Jiang and those close to him who controlled China’s transport-related sectors were a tremendous asset for Li. They paved the way for China to support one of CK Hutchison’s subsidiaries to acquire the rights to operate the two Panama ports. Li was indebted to Deng and Jiang for helping his business expand in China and beyond. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tours the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City on Feb. 2. After the U.S. made the canal a point of contention between itself and China, Panama announced it would withdraw from the China-led Belt and Road Initiative in 2026. (Pool photo/Reuters) The CK Hutchison subsidiary acquired the rights from the Panamanian government in 1997. The handover of Hong Kong from the U.K. to China also took place that year. The ports in question are the port of Balboa on the Pacific side of the canal and the port of Cristobal on the Atlantic side. In 2021, four years after the U.K. handed over Hong Kong, China joined the World Trade Organization under Jiang, and U.S.-China trade quickly expanded. As a result, CK Hutchison’s profits from operating the Panama ports grew. This trend accelerated during the era of Jiang’s successor, Hu Jintao, as the Chinese economy grew rapidly. But China, its economy and the world it exists in have drastically changed since Xi Jinping took over from Hu as party general secretary in 2012. The change in U.S.-China relations has been especially dramatic. When Donald Trump, who in January was inaugurated for a second term as U.S. president, declared he would take back the Panama Canal, CK Hutchison faced the possibility of becoming a direct target. Despite Trump’s threat coming suddenly, it was not long before Panama announced it would withdraw from the China-led Belt and Road Initiative in 2026, when its memorandum of understanding with China to cooperate on the global infrastructure drive is due to expire. With Panama more or less bowing to Trump, suddenly the threat to CK Hutchison became all the more real. Li moved quickly. On March 4, his conglomerate signed an agreement to sell its non-Chinese port assets, including the two Panama Canal ports, to a consortium led by U.S. asset management firm BlackRock. An unhappy Xi administration responded to the announced deal, albeit indirectly, after the National People’s Congress, China’s national legislature, ended its annual session on March 11. The Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the party’s Central Committee reposted on its website a harshly critical article published in Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese government-affiliated Hong Kong newspaper. This commentary published by Ta Kung Pao suggests it is “understandable” that many would view the Panama deal as&nbsp;a betrayal of the Chinese people. (Photo by Kenji Kawase) The article lashed out at the deal, claiming it would undermine China’s national security and interests. Ta Kung Pao also published a commentary calling for CK Hutchison to halt the transaction and suggesting the deal would violate the national security ordinance, which took effect in Hong Kong a year ago. It remains unclear whether Beijing’s indirect pressure could lead to CK Hutchison reconsidering its decision. CK Hutchison is a private company, not state-owned. The conglomerate is huge but does not have the power to shrug off the political risk that comes from being caught between the world’s two largest economic foes. Although the Xi administration often stresses the need for “patriotism” and “national security,” there is no way it could protect CK Hutchison from the pressure that would be piled onto it by a determined U.S. Three decades ago, with the handover looming, Hong Kong companies began moving closer to mainland China under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised “a high degree of autonomy” for the former British colony. Deng firmly pledged to keep the formula unchanged for 50 years after the handover. Jiang and Hu maintained the guarantee, which has since disintegrated. In the new political reality, it is only natural for Hong Kong merchants to behave differently. Li was born in China’s Guangdong province, adjacent to Hong Kong, in 1928. His long life has allowed him to observe many chapters of Chinese history. The lessons he has taken away have taught him how to be quick to seize an opportunity. Li Ka-shing, chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings, waves goodbye to journalists as he formally retires after the company’s annual general meeting in Hong Kong on&nbsp;May 10, 2018.&nbsp;Li would burnish his&nbsp;reputation as “a prophet” some three years later. &nbsp; © Reuters He has also gained the ability to correctly predict where China’s economy and politics — and the international political and economic situations surrounding China — are headed. He demonstrated his foresight by gradually selling off many of his mainland property holdings after Xi became China’s top leader. Prominent Chinese real estate moguls were paying attention to the Hong Kong billionaire’s low-profile asset sell-off, and some of them also escaped the implosion unscathed by following Li’s example. As a result, Li’s reputation as “a prophet” became rock-solid. This time, Li has decided to divest CK Hutchison’s operating rights for many overseas ports even as they generate profits. Will this also prove prescient?",

    "description": "Kikkoman has produced its soy sauce in the U.S. for over 50 years. (Photo by Momoko Imamura) Japanese seasoning maker sees American market having room to double MOMOKO IMAMURA March 27, 2025 01:46 JST TOKYO — Japanese soy sauce maker Kikkoman is not concerned about President Donald Trump’s plans to impose additional tariffs&nbsp;as its containers and raw materials are all produced in the U.S., President and CEO Shozaburo Nakano told&nbsp;Nikkei. Edited excerpts from the interview follow. Q: North America accounts for more than 60% of Kikkoman’s consolidated operating profit. How do you see Trump’s tariffs impacting your business? A: Our soy sauce is made and sold with American ingredients and materials, so it is not affected by tariffs. As soy sauce has a low unit price per weight, it is difficult to make a profit unless it is produced locally, so we have done so for over 50 years and made it a part of the American diet. Kikkoman&nbsp;CEO Shozaburo Nakano told Nikkei&nbsp;the company looks&nbsp;to expand its reach in the U.S. to more Latin American and younger consumers. (Photo by Momoko Imamura) The soy sauce we make in Japan uses ingredients from North America, so it is affected by exchange rates and other factors. In our food wholesale business, we would like to increase the proportion of products made in the U.S. Many of our rice and seafood products are produced&nbsp;in the U.S. We also export products from China and Southeast Asia, so we will be affected by tariffs there, but our competitors are in the same boat, so we’re not worried. By increasing the number of products made in the U.S., we can shorten the entire supply chain and ensure a stable supply. Q: Your new U.S. factory will be start operating from 2026. A: Our production capacity in the U.S. is expected to increase 30% to 40% over the next 10 years. Demand in the U.S. is still growing, and we believe the market has room to double. The growing Latin American population prefers products containing fruit juice, so we will develop products that meet their tastes. We will also reach young people through social media and other means to expand our customer base. Q: In Europe, the supply of soy sauce failed to keep up with the growing demand. A: When demand fell overall due to the coronavirus pandemic, we held back on capital investment. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the European economic slump, we grew cautious, which ended up backfiring. Demand returned last year, and we managed to ship some supply from Singapore and Japan, but the costs were high. We are making capital investments, and our supply capacity will catch up with demand in six months. Q: Kikkoman’s net profit for the year ending March 2025 is expected to rise 9% for&nbsp;the 12th consecutive record. What’s your outlook for&nbsp;next fiscal year? A: We are finished with our prices hikes in Japan, but sales volumes have not returned to the levels before we adjusted prices. We will work on increasing volume by suggesting recipes. We will work to raise sales volume to improve profit margins. To cope with rising logistics costs, we are increasing cargo loads and factory productivity. Raw ingredient prices are already high, so we do not expect to see significant cost increases like we have before. Q: Kikkoman’s return on equity (ROE) for the year ended March 2024 was 12.5%, already exceeding the target of 11% or more for the year ending March 2025. A: We will continue to raise our ROE. Our cash has increased, and our equity ratio has also risen. In addition to capital investment, we are also focusing on returning profits to investors through share buybacks and other means. We are also reducing our cross-shareholdings, including by dissolving our capital tie-up&nbsp;with [food processing company] Riken Vitamin, so we now have some financial leeway. We would also like to pursue an acquisition if we see an opportunity.",

    "description": "The 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum products implemented by the U.S. in March impose additional costs on Japanese companies. © Reuters Executives worry about tariffs and labor costs, stay the course on DEI policies TAKEHIRO HASEGAWA March 27, 2025 01:36 JST TOKYO — Nearly 50% of leaders at major Japanese companies look to ramp up U.S. operations amid President Donald Trump’s efforts to draw foreign investment, but many worry about the uncertainty surrounding his administration’s tariff plans, a Nikkei survey shows. Of the 144 companies that provided responses, 28.3% said they plan to expand in the U.S., with another 20.5% considering doing so, while 0.8% have no presence there now but will enter the market going forward. None intend to scale back U.S. business. About three-quarters of the companies eyeing expansions cited sales as a part of their plans, followed by production at 50.8%, mergers and acquisitions at 47.6%, and startup investment at 34.9%. Among individual industries, electrical equipment, food, and machinery and materials were standouts. The U.S. is expected to see medium- to long-term growth across a broad range of markets, including IT, energy and food, providing business opportunities for the high-value-added products and services that are a specialty of many Japanese companies. Nissin Foods Holdings will start up its first U.S. instant-noodle plant in 47 years this August. Sumitomo Chemical plans to build a production facility for a cleaning solvent used in semiconductor manufacturing. The Trump administration has been working to attract foreign capital to revitalize domestic industry. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said last month that Japan will work to boost investment in the U.S. to $1 trillion, and businesses are following his lead. A total of 41.4% of leaders said in the survey, conducted from Feb. 28 to March 19, that they plan to expand investments in the U.S. or make new ones, a sharp jump from 16.9% in the previous December survey . Yutaka Kyoya, president of food wholesaler Mitsubishi Shokuhin, said he hopes the Japanese government will provide “tax breaks to support direct investment in the U.S.” But deep concerns remain about Trump’s planned tariffs, which would impose additional costs on businesses that import products, parts or consumable goods from covered countries into the U.S. and could drag down the economy in the short term. The Trump administration this month implemented an additional 25% duty on steel and aluminum products . Policy uncertainty was the most commonly cited challenge involved in expanding in the U.S., mentioned by 73% of the executives polled. The Trump administration has repeatedly pushed back implementation of announced tariffs, and the reciprocal tariffs to be announced April 2 may end up being limited to certain countries or products. “Given the need to curb inflation ahead of midterm elections as well, it’s not clear how much they’ll keep raising tariffs,” said Suntory Holdings Chairman Takeshi Niinami. Business leaders also remain wary of production transfers that involve investment. Asked about how they intend to respond to the tariffs, nearly half of 84 companies surveyed that are in the manufacturing sector or have production divisions said they will maintain the status quo or wait and see how things develop. Tariffs are not the only concern. “There will probably be companies that give up because it’s not worth the soaring labor costs in the U.S.,” said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. Executives were also asked about diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), amid hostility from the Trump administration that has spurred companies like McDonald’s, Walmart and Amazon to end or scale back their DEI policies. But 86.6% of respondents say they will not change their DEI guidelines in North America, while only 8.4% plan to make or are considering changes such as dropping the term DEI. Promoting DEI “is crucial for sustainable growth,” Kubota President Yuichi Kitao said. Japan has been relatively laggard with regard to women in the workforce and LGBTQ issues, and most of corporate Japan’s diversity-related targets focus on women. “DEI in Japan still has room for improvement compared with other advanced economies,” Sumitomo Chemical President Keiichi Iwata said. President Akihiko Ogino of Daiwa Securities Group said: “Now, when the global trend is slowing down, is the perfect time for Japanese companies to catch up.”",

    "description": "Most of Vingroup's $30 billion investment in energy infrastructure will go toward renewables, such as wind power. (Photo by Yuji Nitta) Nation's leading conglomerate looks to build out energy infrastructure YUJI NITTA March 27, 2025 00:47 JST HANOI — Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup plans to spend up to $30 billion on renewable energy projects and a liquefied natural gas-fueled power station. The massive investment plan was included in a proposal from Vingroup — sent to government leaders — to develop Vietnam’s power grid, according to local media reports. Vingroup expects to install 25.5 gigawatts worth of power capacity during the first phase of the development project, which runs through 2030. This phase would cost between $25 billion and $30 billion. The majority of the investment would be directed toward renewable energy, such as wind and solar power. More than $20 billion would be invested in developing 20.5 GW worth of capacity in this field. Planned construction sites include Ninh Thuan and Khanh Hoa provinces. Waters stretching from central to southern Vietnam are seen as promising areas for wind farms. For LNG power, Vingroup has proposed building an electrical plant in Haiphong with a capacity of 5 GW. The northern port city is home to a Vingroup-affiliated electric vehicle factory, as well as large real estate developments under the group’s umbrella. Vingroup plans a second phase where it will develop 27 GW of power capacity between 2031 and 2035. The plan is currently being studied, a Vingroup representative told Nikkei. Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade is busy revising the country’s eighth national Power Development Plan, also known as PDP8, which outlines the basic policy for electrical plants and the power grid. The agenda includes the construction of nuclear power plants, as well as a road map for expanding renewable energy. Vingroup’s proposal is aimed at encouraging the addition of its own projects to the modified PDP8. The government expects Vietnam’s gross domestic product to grow by at least 8% this year and aims to surpass 10% growth in the near future. Developing sources of power would meet the increased electricity demand that generally accompanies economic growth.",

(Pool via Reuters) Brazil's biofuels and Japanese autos to help reach carbon neutrality, Ishiba says KANA BABA and NIKI MIZUGUCHI March 27, 2025 00:43 JST TOKYO — Japan and Brazil agreed on Wednesday to cooperate in areas including the economy and climate change during a meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The two sides drew up a five-year action plan covering those areas. The two nations also agreed on reciprocal visits by leaders every two years and confirmed the establishment of a new defense and foreign affairs dialogue. Holding a meeting with Japan is critical at this moment in history when democracy is under threat worldwide, Lula said at the start of the summit at the Akasaka Palace state guest house in Tokyo. The Brazilian president stressed the importance of multilateralism and free trade for mutual development. Ishiba sounded a similar note during the joint press conference following the summit. “We confirmed that we’ll launch a partnership aimed at strengthening peace and multilateralism, and deepen dialogue and cooperation in areas such as security and defense,” he said. Japan and Brazil are drawing closer in a strategic move as global stability is shaken by the return of U.S. President Donald Trump as well as alliances among authoritarian nations such as China and Russia. This year marks the 130th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and Brazil. Lula is the first state guest invited to Japan since 2019, when Trump received the reception during his first term. Ishiba and Lula agreed to use Japan’s official development assistance to recover Brazil land abandoned due to deforestation and slash-and-burn agriculture. The aim to turn the land into high-quality farmland. The two leaders also agreed to begin negotiations on a “working holiday” program that lets young people from Japan and Brazil work and stay in the other country for extended periods. On economic cooperation, the two countries will tap Brazil’s biofuels and Japan’s automotive technology to “lead the decarbonization of the global automotive sector,” Ishiba said at the press conference. Prior to the summit, government officials and companies from the two nations signed about 80 memorandums of understanding covering areas such as decarbonization and digitalization. Ishiba and Lula attended a business forum in Tokyo and welcomed the signings. Lula said that the Japan and Mercosur, the South American trade bloc, should advance talks toward a free trade agreement. Among the memorandums signed on Wednesday, Yokohama-based Tsubame BHB will work with Brazilian counterparts on using green ammonia for fertilizer. The green ammonia will be made from waste created from processing sugarcane, a raw material for bioethanol. Trading company Sumitomo Corp. will roll out technology that keeps pork fresh longer during transport. Air carrier ANA Holdings signed a memorandum to buy aircraft made by Embraer, the Brazilian plane manufacturer. Ishiba noted that Japan’s direct investment in Brazil from last year totaled 1.3 trillion yen ($8.64 billion). “This is the true reflection of the anticipation that Japanese companies have for Brazil,” the prime minister said. Japan has imported core commodities such as iron ore and soybeans from Brazil, South America’s largest economy. In return, Japan have exported industrial products such as auto parts. Tokyo also sees Brazil as crucial to working with developing and emerging Global South economies. Brazil is a member of the BRICS group of emerging economies, which includes Russia, China and India, but shares common values with Japan, including the rule of law and international cooperation. With a history of taking in Japanese immigrants, Brazil has roughly 2.7 million people of Japanese descent — the most in the world outside of Japan. Tokyo regards the new five-year plan as reaffirming their commitment to work together with an eye toward keeping Brazil from leaning toward Russia or China.",

    "description": "Around 30% of the EV assembly process has been automated at the new GAC Honda plant.&nbsp;(Photo by Shizuka Tanabe) Automaker boosts efficiency with eye on 100% electrification goal SHIZUKA TANABE March 27, 2025 00:40 JST GUANGZHOU — Honda Motor is using artificial intelligence and automation to streamline production at a new Chinese electric vehicle plant, cutting staffing needs by 30% compared with its conventional factories. GAC Honda Automobile, Honda’s joint venture with Chinese automaker Guangzhou Automobile Group, opened its EV plant in Guangzhou , which came online late last year, to the media on Wednesday. Production of the P7 electric sport utility vehicle, set to release in April, kicked off that day. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) were used to move body parts around the factory floor, allowing Honda to eliminate all tasks in which workers transported parts during the pressing process. AGVs were used to transport EV batteries, which weigh about 600 kilograms, as well. Honda also adopted AI-based technology to optimize the welding process for the first time. “We will use electrification as an opportunity to overhaul the way we produce vehicles,” said a GAC Honda executive. “The key is to reduce fixed costs as much as possible.” Automated guided vehicles transport parts at GAC Honda’s Guangzhou plant. (Photo by Shizuka Tanabe) EVs, plug-in hybrids and other new energy vehicles made up 49% of new passenger vehicle sales in China in 2024. “The trend toward electrification in China is clear,” GAC Honda President Katsuhide Moriyama said. But Honda faces headwinds in China. It is expected to suffer a 55 billion yen ($365 million) loss on investments accounted for using the equity method — a metric that reflects the performance of its Chinese operations — for the fiscal year ending Monday. With a relatively limited lineup of new energy vehicles, Honda’s new vehicle sales in China fell roughly 30% in 2024 to 850,000 units. Of them, only around 10,000 were EVs. Artificial intelligence optimizes the amount of current and voltage used in the welding process at the new GAC Honda plant. (Photo by Shizuka Tanabe) This has led to excess capacity. Honda is looking to produce vehicles more efficiently given the competitive market. Honda aims for 100% of its new vehicle sales to come from EVs or fuel-cell vehicles in 2040. Its global EV production is only expected to grow as it plans new releases in North America and Japan. “Knowledge on how to assemble batteries and suspension parts as efficiently as possible can be applied globally,” the GAC Honda executive said.",

Chiba Bank, the largest regional bank&nbsp;in Chiba prefecture, just east of Tokyo, will purchase the shares from Ariake Capital, an investment company that targets regional lenders and other entities. Under the share transfer agreement&nbsp;expected soon, Chiba Bank&nbsp;will acquire 19.9% of the shares in Chiba Kogyo, the prefecture’s third largest regional bank, on a voting rights basis. Ariake Capital began making substantial investments in Chiba Kogyo around 2022, providing&nbsp;advice on improving management. It became the largest shareholder in January 2025. Chiba Kogyo’s market capitalization stands around&nbsp;90 billion yen, making the stake to be acquired by Chiba Bank worth about 18 billion yen. Chiba Bank is expected to become the largest shareholder. Several large regional banks have been able to coexist in Chiba, given the prefecture’s large population and numerous&nbsp;companies stemming from its location in the greater Tokyo metro area. But population decline in southern Chiba has led to consolidation of some branches. With the Bank of Japan moving last year to reverse its longtime negative interest rate policy, and with further rate hikes on the horizon, banks are rushing to solidify their foundations in order to acquire deposits and support business partners. Chiba Kogyo was established in 1952. When Japan’s economic bubble burst, the bank&nbsp;was left with many bad loans and received public funds in 2000. Even after paying off its debt, the lender&nbsp;had to deal with the redemption of preferred shares, which carried a heavy dividend burden. Japan’s Financial Services Agency requires companies that acquire a 20% stake or more of banks and other institutions to obtain authorization for such reasons as ensuring management stability. Chiba Bank and Chiba Kogyo will discuss their future structure and cooperative relationship. Chiba Bank appears to be considering acquiring more than 20% to strengthen the relationship further. As the two banks deepen their relationship, the response of major Japanese lender Mizuho Bank, which holds 12.6% of Chiba Kogyo’s shares, also will be a focus. Mizuho’s predecessor, the former Fuji Bank, took on&nbsp;Chiba Kogyo’s capital increases. Mizuho counted&nbsp;Chiba Kogyo as an equity method affiliate for many years, until 2023.",

The two men had a “candid and in-depth” exchange of views on key economic and trade issues , and agreed to maintain communications, Xinhua said. The call came as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to impose reciprocal tariffs next week, potentially slapping more duties on Chinese goods. Trump has imposed 20% levies on all Chinese imports since taking office in January, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to stem the outflow of chemical precursors used to produce the deadly drug fentanyl. China retaliated by imposing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods ranging from oil and liquefied natural gas to agricultural products. The tit-for-tat measures added new strains to relations between the two major powers that have already sunk to historic lows in recent years due to issues ranging from trade and technology curbs to Taiwan.",

    "description": "China's BYD, which has overtaken Elon Musk's Tesla in EV sales,&nbsp;will continue building factories overseas without partners as it has abundant funding, Chairman Wang Chuanfu said.&nbsp; Chinese EV giant to overcome tariffs with local assembly in some countries March 26, 2025 20:58 JST SHANGHAI (Reuters) — Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD aims to double its sales outside China to more than 800,000 cars in 2025 and will look to overcome tariffs by assembling cars locally, its chairman told analysts on an earnings call on Tuesday. BYD, which sold 417,204 units overseas in 2024, expects to see “a substantial rise” in its market share in Britain, which is “very open” to competitive Chinese products, according to a transcript of the call by Wang Chuanfu that was reviewed by Reuters. The company also sees “great opportunities” to grow rapidly in Latin American and Southeast Asian countries, where the governments and people are friendly towards Chinese brands, he said. With governments abroad weighing or levying tariffs against Chinese-made cars, BYD plans to keep its cost advantage by purchasing key components from China and assembling the vehicles in local markets, Wang added, without specifying the countries he was referring to. A BYD representative confirmed the target of doubling overseas sales to 800,000 units this year, but did not respond to a request for comment on the rest of Wang’s remarks. BYD is leading an overseas push by Chinese automakers, opening showrooms in markets from Australia to Germany as it seeks a respite from a brutal price war at home. Wang said last year that BYD expects exports to help shore up profitability. During the Tuesday meeting he told analysts he expected to see the majority of BYD’s profits coming from overseas markets “at a certain stage”. He didn’t specify the timing for that to be achieved. The company will continue building factories overseas without partners as it has abundant funding, Wang added. BYD is currently building a factory in Brazil, its biggest market outside China, although the development was hit last year by allegations of labour abuses. The carmaker is also building factories in Thailand, Hungary and Turkey. In addition, Wang said that BYD had no plans to sell into Canada and the United States in the short term due to geopolitical developments. The Trump administration has maintained duties of 100% on Chinese-made EVs, as has Canada. Wang told the analysts he was confident BYD’s profitability per vehicle would exceed Toyota’s when it reached the scale of the Japanese manufacturer, saying BYD’s cost control was better. Toyota 7203.T, the world’s top automaker by sales, sold 10.8 million vehicles in 2024, while BYD sold 4.27 million. BYD, which is targeting sales of 5.5 million units this year, has roiled the Chinese auto market by rolling out more affordable models, including its entry-level Seagull electric hatchback that sells for less than $10,000. It also offers smart driving features at no extra charge on most of its lineup. BYD plans to expand the team that works on intelligent software and components such as semiconductors to as many as 8,000 people from the current 5,000, Wang said, without giving a timeline. It also intends to take its affordable smart driving technologies to the global market in 2026 or 2027 and plans to send more employees overseas to handle the plan, he added.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Currencies/Rupiah-decline-different-from-1998-crisis-says-Indonesia-central-bank",
    "description": "Bank&nbsp;Indonesia held a press briefing on March 26, after the central bank, lenders&nbsp;and investors saw a rapid fall of the rupiah in the currency market the day before.&nbsp;(Photo by Ken Kobayashi) Bank Indonesia assures drop in rupiah will not lead to repeat of past crises ISMI DAMAYANTI ISMI DAMAYANTI March 26, 2025 20:52 JST JAKARTA — Indonesia’s&nbsp;central bank on Wednesday tried to tame market concerns over the rupiah’s recent depreciation to a 27-year low, saying the situation is far from a repeat of the 1998 financial crisis. “We’ve learned a lot since then,” said Solikin Juhro, Bank Indonesia’s head of macroprudential policy, during a press briefing after the central bank, lenders&nbsp;and investors saw a rapid fall of the rupiah in the currency market on Tuesday. “We don’t need to worry too much about this because this is far from the situation in 1998 with weakening purchasing power, yet a different situation,” said Bank Indonesia spokesperson Ramdan Denny Prakoso in the briefing, echoing the macroprudential policy head. After hitting a low of 16,640 per dollar on the previous day, the weakest since June 1998 , the rupiah rebounded slightly to 16,588 on Wednesday, based on Bank Indonesia’s Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR). In 1998, the rupiah plunged from 2,800 to 16,800 per U.S. dollar amid a lack of financial market resilience and limited foreign exchange reserves. “At that time, our financial system was far more vulnerable,” Juhro said. He pointed to Indonesia’s stability during the 2008 global financial crisis as proof of progress. “We now have stronger regulations and comprehensive policy frameworks in place.” “The banking sector now has been mitigated from crisis [with an] integrated prevention protocol that we developed,” Juhro added. “Macroprudential policy aims to ensure optimal credit growth, a resilient financial system, and inclusive financing, all of which support sustainable economic growth.” Coordinating Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto expressed confidence that the rupiah will rebound, supported by strong economic fundamentals, including solid export performance and healthy foreign exchange reserves in the medium to long term. “We also have regulations in place to retain export earnings within the country,” he said. Hartarto emphasized that these export earnings will serve as a key foundation for the rupiah’s stability. “With these fundamentals, we won’t remain under pressure for long.” The recent rupiah weakening came from a combination of factors such as a widening current account deficit amid export uncertainties due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policy, early concerns over fiscal deficit, and uncertainty surrounding the initial phase of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s administration. The underwhelming market response to the launch of the Danantara sovereign wealth fund&nbsp;and rumors of Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati’s potential resignation next month also hurt the currency’s value. Teuku Riefky, macroeconomics and financial market researcher at the Institute for Economics and Social Research at the University of Indonesia, said domestic sentiment has also affected the rupiah’s decline. “Capital outflows have been driven in part by domestic factors, including political tensions with rising demonstrations in the public,” said Riefky. A wave of mass demonstrations has erupted in several cities across Indonesia over the past week, driven largely by concerns over the legalized involvement of military personnel in civilian roles. Activists and civilian groups have called the policy a setback for democratic progress. To stabilize the currency, Bank Indonesia has intervened in multiple mechanisms, including the spot currency market, the domestic non-deliverable forward market, and the government bond market. The central bank will maintain rupiah stability in line with market mechanisms and the country’s economic fundamentals, according to Juhro. “Comparing with other currencies like the Japanese yen or Korean won, they’re not on a brink of crisis [because] their fundamentals remain resilient.” Juhro also noted that corporate performance remains robust with strong financial capacity, a sign of underlying economic strength. “This helps keep household risks in check and incomes remain within a relatively safe zone.” The stock market had a breather on Wednesday, with the benchmark Jakarta Composite Index&nbsp;rising 3.8% compared with Tuesday’s close.

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/China-demand-slump-hits-earnings-at-top-consumer-goods-companies",
    "description": "Consumers in China are reining in spending, dragging down earnings at&nbsp;some consumer goods companies. © Reuters Food, household goods makers looking for overseas growth face price-dumping claims WATARU SUZUKI March 26, 2025 20:19 JST HONG KONG — China’s top food and household product companies said they would step up efforts to seek growth overseas after weak demand at home dented earnings last year. Hengan International Group, a major producer of tissues and disposable diapers, reported on Tuesday that net profit fell 18% from a year ago to 2.3 billion yuan ($317 million) in 2024. “We’ll be looking for more opportunities overseas,” Hengan International Group CEO Hui Ching Lau told reporters on Tuesday. Lau said the company will be “promoting the development of overseas business as an important strategy this year more than before,” although he did not specify targets. Lau noted that “competition is extremely fierce” in China and the company is suffering the impact of a price war between e-commerce operators such as Pinduoduo and Douyin. For example, Hengan’s 24-box tissue pack is sold for just 33 yuan on Pinduoduo compared to 62 on Taobao, which is owned by Alibaba Group. Higher raw material prices and increased spending on promotions also eroded Hengan’s profit margin. “If everyone were to operate at a loss continuously, a company wouldn’t be able to keep going,” said Lau, projecting that such a trend would persist until the market undergoes consolidation. He added that China’s tissue market remains extremely fragmented, pointing to the “several hundred” small factories operating in just the one city of Baoding, in northeastern Hebei province. Meanwhile, bottled water maker Nongfu Spring’s annual revenue and net profit grew less than 1%, dragged down by a slump in the second half of the year. In particular, its packaged water business took a sharp hit, falling 21% from a year ago to 15.95 billion yuan. The company blamed the decline on “a surge of online attacks and malicious defamation” since February last year after Chinese nationalists hurled accusations at its red-capped water bottles for resembling the Japanese flag when held up against a piece of white paper. The company later introduced a new bottle with a green cap.

Results at both Hengan and Nongfu missed analyst estimates published on FactSet. China faces deflationary pressures on the back of a property market downturn and as consumers reined in spending due to weak job prospects. The consumer price index for the first two months of 2025 slipped 0.1% annually, bogged down by declines in food and consumer goods prices. Given weak demand at home, some companies are expanding abroad but such moves have led to accusations by other countries, including the U.S., that China was dumping excess capacity overseas. Premier Li Qiang has acknowledged the issue, saying in a government work report released earlier this month that China will “take comprehensive steps to address rat race competition.” WH Group Chairman Wan Long, right,&nbsp;told reporters in Hong Kong on Tuesday that the U.S.-China tariff war will “not have a significant impact” on the meat processing company.&nbsp;(Photo by Wataru Suzuki) Other companies that have a presence overseas fared better. The world’s largest pork producer WH Group, said stronger earnings in Europe and the U.S. helped offset lower packaged meat and pork sales in China. WH Group reported an 8% decline in packaged meat sales in China, which it attributed to a “lack of effective demand from the market.” Sales in Europe, however, grew by 25%, thanks to its acquisition of Spanish meat producer Argal which was completed in March 2024. In January, WH Group listed its U.S. meat processing subsidiary Smithfield on the Nasdaq exchange. Chairman and CEO Wan Long said the company would “continue to accelerate expansion in the U.S. and Europe” through acquisitions and would not be as active in China. When asked about the impact of the intensifying trade war between the U.S. and China, Wan said the additional tariffs would “not have a significant impact” on its business due to resilient demand in the U.S. and the group’s global footprint. WH Group said it would adjust its product mix to minimize the impact. On a positive note, higher spending for collectible toys propelled Pop Mart’s net profit by 189% annually to 3.1 billion yuan. Known for its animated characters made of vinyl, the group’s revenue in mainland China grew 52%, while overseas sales jumped nearly fivefold. Pop Mart CEO Wang Ning said during an analyst meeting on Wednesday that the company aims to increase its total revenue by 50% in 2025. Part of the strategy is to raise the ratio of its overseas revenue from 39% in 2024 to over 50%. He added that domestic performance in the first quarter has “exceeded our expectations,” thanks to hugely popular figurines from blockbuster movie Nezha 2. The company’s Hong Kong-listed shares climbed over 11% after his remarks.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Annual-Thai-censure-debate-centers-on-Thaksin-Shinawatra-s-political-role",
    "description": "Thai opposition leader and People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut speaks&nbsp;during the annual&nbsp;parliamentary no-confidence debate. © Reuters Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra easily survives no-confidence vote FRANCESCA REGALADO March 26, 2025 19:49 JST BANGKOK — Thailand’s main opposition People’s Party used a two-day parliamentary censure debate to question Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra about her father Thaksin Shinawatra’s influence on the government. The prime minister easily survived a no-confidence vote on Wednesday, 319-162, but the debate allowed the opposition to air in the legislature allegations that have dogged Paetongtarn over her seven-month tenure. Opposition leader Nattaphong Ruengpanyawut said Paetongtarn “lacks the qualifications” to serve as prime minister. “She evades taxes, evades her duties, and evades reality. Therefore, she cannot be trusted to continue as prime minister,” he said in his closing remarks late Tuesday. The censure debate is an annual ritual for the Thai prime minister. A political novice at 38, Paetongtarn’s election in August came after the Constitutional Court removed then-Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. Paetongtarn was quickly selected by her Pheu Thai party’s ruling coalition, a mashup of conservative parties that previously opposed her father Thaksin. Thaksin was deposed as prime minister by a military coup in 2006, with the court dissolving his Thai Rak Thai party. His self-exile abroad ended in 2022, the day of Srettha’s election. “Twenty years ago, Thailand lost everything to get Thaksin out of the country,” Nattaphong said, referring to the coup. “But 20 years later, Thailand is about to lose everything again to get Thaksin back,” he added, a nod to how Pheu Thai achieved power. Pheu Thai was beaten in the May 2023 general election by the progressive Move Forward Party, the predecessor of the People’s Party. The two groups initially planned to form a government, until Pheu Thai joined forces with its conservative former rivals. Paetongtarn stood by her close relationship with Thaksin. “It is not a bad thing for me to listen to or use or consider Dr. Thaksin’s advice because he is a person with knowledge and ability and is widely accepted both domestically and internationally,” she said in her closing remarks. Other opposition parliamentarians questioned Thaksin’s confinement in the Police General Hospital, where he served six months of a one-year commuted sentence before receiving a royal pardon. A surprise intervention was made by former Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan. He used his first speech in parliament to criticize Pheu Thai’s plan to legalize gambling. Prawit, one of the generals that led a coup against then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra — Paetongtarn’s aunt — in 2014, split from the Pheu Thai coalition last year. “Casinos will lead the country to the most dangerous disaster because it will weaken society and create many more gray businesses,” Prawit said. The cabinet plans to submit its draft bill on so-called entertainment complexes, which include casinos, to parliament despite questions of their legality. On Wednesday, Nattaphong exchanged pleasantries with Paetongtarn on the dais after the vote. Much like Paetongtarn, Nattaphong rose to the top of his party after a Constitutional Court ruling that dissolved the Move Forward Party. The opposition’s senior leaders were also banned from politics for 10 years. During the debate, Paetongtarn accused Nattaphong in turn of being influenced by another unelected official, alluding to progressive firebrand Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Thanathorn was banned from politics for 10 years in 2020. “If the party before mine had not been politically persecuted, today we might still have a prime minister named Thaksin, and your party might have a leader named Thanathorn,” Paetongtarn said. In rebuttal, Nattaphong pressed the prime minister to act on her party’s promise to reform the constitution. Nattaphong told Nikkei Asia last year that the constitution, instituted in 2017 by the leaders of the 2014 military coup, skews the electoral process and gives the court outsize power to dissolve political parties. The debate also yielded a promise from Paetongtarn to pay taxes on share transfers. People’s Party MP Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn revealed on Monday that Paetongtarn had not paid taxes on share transfers for nine years, accruing a bill of 218 million baht ($6.4 million). Analysts expect a cabinet reshuffle now that the no-confidence vote has passed. The reshuffle will likely be limited to the ministries controlled by Pheu Thai with coalition partners holding on to their portfolios.

    "description": "Ivan Espinosa, Nissan's incoming president and CEO, speaks to reporters at a media roundtable held at the carmaker’s technical center near Tokyo&nbsp;on March 25. (Photo by Sayumi Take) Carmaker seeks to revamp corporate culture and speed up product development SAYUMI TAKE SAYUMI TAKE March 26, 2025 18:33 JST TOKYO — Nissan Motor will have “no taboos” when it comes to exploring partnerships to enhance its competitiveness, according to Ivan Espinosa, who is preparing to become president and CEO of the struggling carmaker next week. Nissan is seeking partners that can push it into “the next era of technology”, said Espinosa, currently Nissan’s chief planning officer, at a media roundtable on Tuesday. “In the next 10 years, we need to really, really focus on developing our own ability to deliver and develop the intelligent car,” he said, referring to the use of artificial intelligence and other technologies to enhance the driving experience and autonomous features. He hinted at an openness to partnerships not limited to traditional carmakers whom he said lacked some high-level traits and competencies. Teaming up with such insiders&nbsp;could unlock synergies and spread costs in sales, powertrain technology and battery investment, “But there’s another [part] happening, which is, who should you partner with in order to develop this intelligent car in the future?” Espinosa will take the helm of the ailing company less than two months after it abandoned merger talks with Honda Motor , a plan many investors saw as a potential long-term solution to its weakening competitiveness. Nissan said&nbsp;it is still committed to collaborating on electrification and auto software technologies with its Japanese rival. “The first thing that came through my mind [when&nbsp;offered the job] is, a CEO is normally dealing with one or two major crises in his or her career … but I have to deal with four&nbsp;or five,” said the 46-year-old Mexican national who was appointed to be the next leader of the company earlier this month. Espinosa highlighted the need to address “a deep morale &nbsp; crisis” within the company, along with implementing turnaround measures initially announced under his predecessor, Makoto Uchida, who will step down at the end of this month. “We are, at the moment, lacking empathy at Nissan,” he said. “It’s kind of human nature … It’s very easy to start finger-pointing at each other” when business is&nbsp;difficult, he said. “Some of the messages that I’ve exchanged one on one with new executive committee members is the need to work as one single team,” said Espinosa. “We need to work together, hand in hand … with one single direction, so we can be quick, we can be determined, no more hesitation about what we should be doing.” Nissan must also speed up decision-making and product launches. For example, the carmaker currently takes about 55 months to develop a new car but will aim to shorten that time to about 37 months or less, he said. Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003 and currently serves on Nissan’s executive committee, admitted to “regret” over not pushing earlier for cultural and other internal changes. “Changing a big company like Nissan is not easy … [but] I’m determined to do that change. Now I have the ability to do so, [and] I have very clear in my mind&nbsp;what has to change.” A pressing issue for Nissan is generating revenue. It expects a net loss of 80 billion yen &nbsp;($532 million) for the fiscal year ending this month, taking it into the red for the first time in four years. Major credit&nbsp;rating agencies have downgraded Nissan’s credit to junk status with a negative outlook. The company will update its product lineup in key markets, including the U.S., where it is struggling with declining sales. For the fiscal year starting in April, it will launch a plug-in hybrid model of the Rogue sports utility vehicle in the country to address the absence of hybrids, an increasingly popular vehicle type. Nissan is also developing a new generation model of its hybrid e-Power system, seeking to enhance&nbsp;fuel efficiency when the car is traveling at high speed&nbsp;by up to&nbsp;15% versus the current system. The updated technology will reach American consumers in fiscal 2026 via a new model&nbsp;Rogue. Nissan is&nbsp;developing a new version of the Leaf, its&nbsp;flagship EV. (Nissan Motor) On electric vehicles, the company is developing a new version of the flagship Leaf, with improved aerodynamics, energy management and driving range. It will launch the new model in the U.S. in fiscal 2025 compatible with Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS), a first for a Nissan EV. Espinosa also hopes to address Nissan’s weak brand power, which has also been blamed for the company’s poor business performance. “My vision for the portfolio, moving forward, is to have maybe five or six brand-oriented models&nbsp;that should go to as [close to] every market as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;… cars that are really describing what Nissan is about,” he told reporters. Models like the Patrol SUV, the Z sports car and the Leaf, can help customers understand that “Nissan is excitement, Nissan is technology,” said Espinosa, a longtime product specialist.",

Starlink can provide its service to a maximum of 600,000 subscriptions in Vietnam, and the pilot program must end before Jan.&nbsp;1, 2031, the government said in a statement on its website. There will be no limit on foreign ownership of Starlink service in Vietnam. However, the project still needs to ensure national defense and security. The government has assigned the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Public Security to coordinate&nbsp;and the Ministry of Science and Technology to jointly work on the project. Vietnam’s moves come just a week ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected announcement on reciprocal tariffs on April 2 that could apply to all U.S. trading partners, but he said on Monday that he “may give a lot of countries breaks.” Vietnam has been trying to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S., which was $123.5 billion last year and the third biggest trade gap for the U.S. after China and Mexico. Its finance ministry announced Tuesday that Vietnam is planning to&nbsp;cut import tariffs on several U.S. products, including liquefied natural gas, cars, ethanol&nbsp;and other agriculture products. Vietnam’s economic growth of 7.1% in 2024 was one of the strongest in the region, but it is highly reliant on exports, which grew 14% last year, and the U.S. was its biggest market. Last week, Vietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh greeted a representative of conglomerate The Trump Organization in Vietnam. The company is planning to invest around $1.5 billion in an urban complex project that includes a golf course in northern Hung Yen province , according to a report on the prime minister’s website. The Starlink services that will be allowed include fixed satellite services (internet access services and&nbsp;privately leased channel services for mobile receiving and transmitting stations) and mobile satellite services (internet access services at sea and&nbsp;on airplanes), the Vietnamese&nbsp;government statement said. The country’s remote areas still have limited access to the internet due to the high cost of infrastructure investment, so low-earth orbit systems such as Starlink can “act as a complementary solution to provide telecommunication and internet services with many advantages,” Vietnam’s Authority of Radio Frequency Management said on its website earlier this month. Vietnam’s approval of Starlink also aligns with its efforts to boost its digital transformation and attract more foreign investments, especially in high-tech sectors such as AI and semiconductors. Vietnam has urged foreign investors to boost their investments and involve local companies in their supply chains. Samsung has invested more than $20 billion in Vietnam, and&nbsp;Nvidia is opening an R&amp;D center in the country. The Starlink pilot plan may be canceled at any time if the license is withdrawn or the project violates the requirements stated by the authorities. Last week, the Italian defense minister said negotiations on a potential contract between Starlink and the Italian government have stalled, which reflected broader geopolitical tensions, Reuters reported.",

At the end of last year, the Philippine restaurant group had 9,766 outlets worldwide, including those of its flagship fried chicken Jollibee chain. This year, the company will invest from 18 billion pesos to 21 billion pesos ($312 million to $364 million) for 700 to 800 new stores, which would bring its total network above 10,000 outlets. “We’re not in all 50 states [in the U.S.]. We’re in only maybe 15 states,” Richard Shin, the company’s chief financial and risk officer, told reporters on Tuesday while briefing them on last year’s earnings, referring to its North American expansion strategy. The Jollibee chain opened its first North American store in Daly City, California, in 1998. At the end of 2024, it had 103 locations in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, the company had 266 North American restaurants under other brands. To accelerate the expansion, Jollibee will expand the franchising of its brands in the U.S., according to the company. Franchisees will be able to locate eateries in stand-alone buildings, strip malls, airports or transit hubs. “Our growth model for capital, again, is shifting to the franchise model,” Shin said. “We’ll have less and less capex [capital expenditure] requirements for store expansions.” Shin said Jollibee sees an opportunity in a North American market where Kentucky Fried Chicken, he noted, has 8,000 locations. “So you could imagine the room for growth for a brand like Jollibee,” he said, “which consistently gets voted by consumers two years in a row, 2023 and 2024, as the best fried chicken.” For the flagship fried chicken chain, “Jollibee’s projected expansion goal is to have 350 stores across both the U.S. and Canada in the next couple of years,” the company said earlier this month in a news statement when it announced a new franchising partnership in the U.S. The company’s net profit for 2024 grew 17.7% to 10.3 billion pesos, anchored by a double-digit revenue increase driven by store expansions, including acquisitions. In its earnings guidance, Jollibee indicated it expects 8% to 12% growth this year in “system wide sales” — all sales to consumers by company-owned and franchised stores. Jollibee also indicated it is shooting for its store network to grow as much as 8%. The food giant has been aggressive in acquiring brands , scooping up South Korean chain Compose Coffee in August, taking full ownership of Hong Kong-based restaurant chain Tim Ho Wan and acquiring Taiwanese wellness soup brand Moon Moon. Jollibee also has ownership stakes in Chinese fast-food chain Yonghe King, and American brands Smashburger and The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf. Additional reporting by Ella Hermonio.",

The prosecutors can appeal the ruling, which would bring the case to the Supreme Court, South Korea’s highest legal body. Speaking outside the court after the decision was announced, Lee Jae-myung&nbsp;thanked the court for what he called a “proper ruling.” The charges against Lee stem from remarks he made while running in his party’s presidential primary in 2021 when he claimed to have been unacquainted with a key figure in a property development scandal. The scandal involved a redevelopment project in the city of Seongnam, where Lee was mayor. Prosecutors argue that Lee was lying about his relationship with businessman Kim Moon-ki to hide his own culpability in the property deal. Immediately after the court’s decision was announced, Kweon&nbsp;Seong-dong, the leader of the ruling People Power Party, called verdict “regretful” and urged the Supreme Court to quickly rule&nbsp;on the case.&nbsp; Lee, a lawyer by training and veteran politician, lost the 2022 presidential election to now-impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol by the narrowest margin in South Korea’s democratic history. A protester in Seoul holds a sign calling for opposition leader Lee Jae-myung to be arrested on Dec. 31, 2024. &nbsp; © Reuters Yoon, a bitter rival of Lee’s, is awaiting a Constitutional Court verdict on his December impeachment on charges of leading an insurrection. Lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon following his attempt in early December to institute martial law, a measure he claimed was necessary to protect South Korea from “anti-state forces” in the opposition. The measure was quickly voted down in the National Assembly, but the attempt sparked a political crisis that is still unfolding months later. The Constitutional Court concluded hearings on Yoon’s case late last month and is expected to render its verdict within days, although no official date has been announced. If the court finds Yoon not guilty, he will be immediately restored to office. If it finds him guilty, a snap election will take place within 60 days. Data released last week by pollster Gallup Korea showed Lee to be the leading choice among candidates that could run in the next presidential election. Lee had 36% of support, far ahead of the No. 2 prospective contender, conservative Labor Minister Kim Moon-soo .",

    "description": "MUFG and SMBC must reaffirm their net-zero commitments and translate these pledges into actionable policies and targets aligned with climate science and the Paris Agreement. (Source photos by Yuki Nakao) MUFG and SMBC's UN climate exit signals a troubling retreat from sustainability Eri Watanabe Eri Watanabe March 26, 2025 17:05 JST Eri Watanabe is a senior Japan energy finance campaigner at Market Forces, a clean energy finance advocacy group working across Asia and Australia. Japan’s two largest banks, MUFG and SMBC, recently followed the biggest U.S. and Canadian banks in withdrawing from the United Nations-led Net-Zero Banking Alliance. These moves put global banking and investor climate initiatives under threat and place secure economies at risk. Japan’s major banks have a duty to hold firm on their net-zero commitments and accelerate efforts to minimize climate risk. The NZBA is rallying its 130 member banks, which hold $49 trillion in assets, to stay the course. Most of Asia’s banks, including those in Singapore and Malaysia, Japan’s Mizuho and Australia’s biggest four this year have held firm on their commitments to achieving net zero and retaining their NZBA membership. It’s critical that Asia’s banks avoid short-term political and financial expediency, which risks undermining their long-standing commitments to climate goals and sustainability. The transition to a net-zero economy is supercharging, and banks need to recognize that there is no turning back. To avoid losing more members, the NZBA is giving serious consideration to watering down its climate ambitions. Yet for many banks, including those jumping ship, the NZBA has enabled them to engage in greenwashing and window dressing by failing to hold coal, oil and gas companies as well as other high emitting customers to account. MUFG joined NZBA in June 2021 as the first member bank from Japan , and led the alliance’s steering group. In MUFG’s 2024-2026 management plan, the bank pledges to “drive social and environmental progress,” including “achievement of a carbon neutral society.” SMBC has long positioned itself as a green bank and in its 2023-2025 medium-term management plan highlighted its commitment to decarbonization and addressing global inequalities. However, alongside these commitments, MUFG and SMBC have funded oil and gas developments, joining the “dirty dozen” top 12-ranked global financiers of fossil fuels, according to a Banking on Climate Chaos report. The next litmus test for MUFG, SMBC and Mizuho will be whether they can effectively implement measures to support the genuine transition of high-emitting customers. Leading banks in Europe and Australia have demonstrated that financing companies with credible transition plans is core to managing climate and associated financial risks. Last year around one in four investors and shareholders called on Japan’s megabanks to improve disclosure on their assessments of the climate transition plans of their customers. Fortunately, the U.S.-led revolt against corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibilities has not yet imposed a significant impact on Asian economies. But the risk of a broader shock looms as MUFG, SMBC, Nomura and Norinchukin have jumped on the bandwagon, shunning climate science. People walk through water at a flooded area affected by rising sea levels and land subsidence in North Jakarta, Indonesia, on&nbsp;Nov. 20, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp; © Reuters If Japan’s banks fail to adhere to their net-zero commitments and continue supporting companies expanding oil, gas and coal businesses, they jeopardize their bottom lines, their reputations and send damaging signals to the markets they wish to serve. There is overwhelming evidence of immense economic risks associated with climate change. In 25 years, extreme heat, rain and flooding will cause $38 trillion in annual damages, according to the Potsdam Institute. The warning bells must be ringing loud and clear for Japanese banks. A global network of 141 central banks and regulators recently estimated that under current climate targets and policies, the Japanese economy could lose about $9.2 trillion by 2050. Conversely, if private and government leaders unite around the world to fully implement a transition to net-zero emissions by mid-century, by 2070 the global economy could win a $43 trillion windfall and 3.8% more economic growth, according to Deloitte research. Fossil fuels are like a sinking ship. Renewable energy including wind and solar are already undercutting new coal and gas plants on production costs almost everywhere in the world. The economics of coal, oil and gas expansion don’t stack up and more investors are recognizing this cold hard truth. In light of the mounting evidence and dire warnings, the financial sector must not shy away from its role as a catalyst for change and genuinely enable the transition to a net-zero economy. Despite withdrawing from the NZBA, MUFG, SMBC, Nomura and Norinchukin must reaffirm their net-zero commitments and translate these pledges into actionable policies and targets aligned with climate science and the Paris Agreement. Another test for the Japanese megabanks is whether they will continue providing finance for one of the biggest and most polluting liquified natural gas projects ever planned, Papua LNG. MUFG has acted as a financial advisor, yet the Papua New Guinea project faces severe financial, political and legal risks. So far, the Asian Development Bank, France’s biggest bank BNP Paribas, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and 10 other lenders have confirmed they will not lend to Papua LNG. Concerns extend beyond this project, especially as all three Japanese megabanks stand out among the top 10 global banks for their financing of LNG projects. Proponents of LNG have long touted the gas as a cleaner fuel compared to coal. Yet exported LNG emits 33% more greenhouse gases than coal when taking into account transport and polluting methane emissions according to findings published in Energy Science and Engineering. Japan’s obsession with LNG threatens its energy security and economic viability due to a big surplus and decreasing demand. A push to resell excess LNG imports and construct LNG power plants across Asia risks locking developing nations into a costly fossil fuel-dependent future, undermining the shift to affordable renewable energy and worsening climate change impacts. The onus is on Japan’s megabanks to determine their role in the transition to a sustainable economy. The banks’ future viability depends on their commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainable practices, which will dictate their long-term financial success in an evolving global economy and a warming planet.",

    "description": "BYD's first hybrid pickup truck in Thailand, the Shark 6, is displayed at the motor show. (Photo by Yuki Kohara)&nbsp; Bangkok auto show sees more than 50 brands on display APORNRATH PHOONPHONGPHIPHAT APORNRATH PHOONPHONGPHIPHAT March 26, 2025 15:24 JST Updated on March 26, 2025 16:27 JST BANGKOK — The 46th&nbsp;Bangkok International Motor Show opened to the public on Wednesday, with more than 50 brands from around the world participating and the offerings on display focusing more on hybrid models rather than EVs. As has been the case in recent years, Chinese manufacturers are taking center stage at the event. EV giant BYD unveiled its latest plug-in hybrid pickup truck, the Shark 6 DMO, a four-wheel drive vehicle priced at 1.69 million baht ($49,000). It is BYD’s first HV pickup truck for sale in the kingdom. The company also introduced another plug-in hybrid, the Sealion 6, a large SUV priced at 899,900 baht. “All the new models that BYD launched today will be one of the highlights of this motor show and will also play a key role in driving the Thai auto market forward,” said Pratarnwong Phornprapha, CEO of Rever Automotive, which handles BYD’s sales and distribution in Thailand. SAIC Motor, which operates the MG brand, is launching both premium hybrid and EV models in a bid to appeal to all customer bases. One offering is the all-new MG3 hybrid plus, a fuel-saving sports sedan priced at just 579,900 baht. The Bangkok&nbsp;International Motor Show runs through April 6. (Photo by Yuki Kohara) Great Wall Motor, meanwhile, is showcasing large SUV models, with its hybrid version priced at 929,000 baht and plug-in hybrid at 1.049 million baht. Japan’s carmakers, which had a 70% share of the Thai market in 2024, are also focusing on hybrids. Toyota Motor is promoting seven hybrid models at the show, including versions of its Camry, Yaris and Corolla brands as well as for its luxury brands such as the Alphard and Vellfire. GWM Vehicle is displayed during&nbsp;Bangkok&nbsp;International Motor Show on March 24. (Photo by Yuki Kohara) “Hybrid models find a good market [in Thailand],” said Nutthorn Sinives, vice president (National Marketing) of Toyota Motor Thailand. “Although many people switched to EVs, certain groups prefer hybrids.” Another key Japanese player, Mitsubishi Motors, launched its XForce HEV hybrid model at the show, with carries a price tag ranging from 899,000 baht to 1.089 million baht. Hybrid sales in Thailand rose to 117,789 units in 2024, up 26% from 2023. Consumer demand is also growing for plug-in hybrids, which can be charged from a standard power outlet, with sales in the kingdom totaling 1,753 units in the first two months of this year, up 478% compared with the same period last year. In contrast, demand for EVs fell as oversupply has triggered a price war, leading people to hold back on purchases in hopes that manufacturers will cut prices in the future. Toyota Motor is promoting seven hybrid models at the show, including versions of its Camry, Yaris and Corolla brands. (Photo by Yuki Kohara)&nbsp; Sales of EVs came to 66,732 units in 2024, down 9.2% from the previous year. EV demand in the first two months of this year remained flat as sales fell 0.12% compared with the same period last year to 14,558 units. High household debt has seen banks apply more stringent loan assessments of late, making it harder for Thais to buy new cars. Thailand’s auto industry saw total car sales drop 26% to 572,675 units for the whole of 2024. This trend has continued into 2025, as total car sales for January and February dropped 9.53% compared with the same period of 2024, to 97,395 units, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). “We need to wait and see how many cars can be sold during the International Motor Show,” which runs from March 26 to April 6, said Surapong Paisitpattanapong, spokesperson for the FTI’s automotive industry club. Thailand’s total car production is also down, dropping 13.62% on the year to 115,487 units in February, while production in the first two months of 2025 dropped 19.29% to 222,590 units. “Considering factors such as driving range, charging time, spare parts prices, charging time and after-sales service, I think hybrids offer more flexibility than EVs,” Mek Srilomsak, a 34-year-old assistant professor at King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, told Nikkei Asia. “In addition, considering Thailand’s industrial sector, which includes many OEMs (original equipment manufacturing) for internal combustion engine parts, promoting hybrids could be a good compromise that benefits both consumers and the industry.”",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Pakistan-s-dispute-over-new-canal-project-threatens-political-coalition",
    "description": "Fishermen cast their&nbsp;nets into&nbsp;the Indus River in Pakistan on March 15.&nbsp; © Reuters Experts say $750m project is impractical and unsustainable Adnan Aamir ADNAN AAMIR March 26, 2025 14:15 JST ISLAMABAD — Growing concerns over a potential water crisis from the building of a new canal have sparked opposition across Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh, with the local assembly passing a resolution against it in mid-March. This has raised fear that the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which has Sindh as its stronghold, could leave the governing coalition of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over the issue. In February, the federal government launched an ambitious agriculture project, the Green Pakistan Initiative, to enhance food security through corporate farming, with the Pakistan army taking the lead. Under this initiative, six canals will be constructed, including one in the Cholistan desert. The government will invest $750 million to build the 176-kilometer-long canal to irrigate 1.2 million acres of barren lands in the desert within the Punjab province. The government claims that the Cholistan canal will use flood water for four months a year and river water from Punjab in the remaining months. River water flows downstream from the north in Punjab to Sindh province in the south. However, on March 13, the Sindh provincial assembly passed a resolution against the construction of this canal. Politicians and rights activists in Sindh allege that the new canal will ultimately eat up the share of water in their province, which was determined by the Water Apportionment Accord of 1991, an agreement between the provinces of the country. If less water flows from the Indus River into the Arabian Sea, there would likely be a big impact on the Indus River Delta, which is home to over a million people, animals and mangrove forests, said water rights activists. “Diverting more river flows away from the delta will hasten land erosion, which has significant environmental consequences as well as implications for migration from areas with rising tides coming in,” Erum Sattar, a lecturer who researches the Indus at Tufts University in the U.S., told Nikkei Asia. Shahab Usto, a civil rights lawyer based in Karachi, warns that water availability could decrease by 30% to 40% in the coming years. “In Sindh, where 70% of the economy depends on agriculture, the [new canal] project threatens livelihoods and can fuel unrest,” he said. “If this canal is built forcefully, without consensus, it could even push the country toward internal conflict.” Experts said that the plan to build a new canal to irrigate a barren desert is impractical and completely unsustainable. “ Punjab [government] insists that the Cholistan canal will function as a flood canal, but floods are unreliable. Since 2010, the Indus River system has not experienced any major floods,” Naseer Memon, a climate change consultant, told Nikkei. “In such a situation, with a huge water deficit already existing, there is simply no surplus water available to support large-scale corporate farming projects,” he added. A farmer sprays pesticide in a field near the&nbsp;Indus&nbsp;River&nbsp;in Pakistan. The Indus River Delta&nbsp;is home to over a million people, animals&nbsp;and mangrove forests. &nbsp; © Reuters Usto, the water rights lawyer, said that all hydrologists have opposed this canal project because it’s neither viable nor sustainable. “Even India’s Indira Gandhi Canal, just across the border from Pakistan’s Cholistan, failed under similar circumstances,” he said. There is also a question about the $750 million cost of this new canal project. “Given the government’s track record of not completing projects on time, alongside frequent time and cost overruns, the reliability of these cost estimates is highly questionable,” Hassan Abbas, a water expert based in Islamabad, told Nikkei. Rights activists in Sindh argue that the federal government initiated the canal project without seeking approval from Council of Common Interests (CCI), which is a constitutional body responsible for resolving inter-provincial disputes. Usto said that any dispute over water distribution should be taken to the CCI, which then takes actions to resolve it. Memon, the climate change consultant, said that the relationship between Sindh and the federal government is likely to be strained due to the canal controversy. “Sindh is the stronghold of the Pakistan People’s Party. If the federal government does not reverse its decision [on new canals], there is a strong possibility that the PPP may eventually part ways with the coalition government of Shehbaz Sharif,” Memon told Nikkei.

    "description": "The rupee touched a year-to-date high of 85.45 to the dollar on March 24. © Reuters South Asian currency rebounds after slumping to a record low in February SOUMYAJIT SAHA March 26, 2025 14:05 JST MUMBAI — The rupee has charged to its strongest position against the dollar this year , helped in part by dollar inflows into India and the return of foreign portfolio investors, though the risk of a setback from expected U.S. tariffs remains. The rupee is also this month’s best performing major Asian currency, rising over 2% in March as of Tuesday’s close, ahead of peers like the Singaporean dollar, Philippine peso and Malaysian ringgit. The currency’s rebound comes after it plumbed record lows in February due to slow domestic growth and foreign investors stepping away from Indian assets. On Monday, the rupee touched a year-to-date high of 85.45 to the dollar. On Tuesday and Wednesday, it fell slightly lower though it remained roughly 2.7% above the all-time low of 87.992 it recorded on Feb. 10. In March, the currency has been largely boosted by financial year-end inflows of dollar-denominated corporate profits, while a return of foreign capital into the wider market has also helped, Dhiraj Nim, forex strategist and economist at ANZ bank told Nikkei Asia. Indian companies often repatriate their dollar-based earnings in March. On Tuesday, foreign investors bought nearly $630 million worth of Indian equities, according to provisional data from the National Stock Exchange. That was on top of about $1.3 billion in foreign inflows into equities over the preceding three trading sessions. As for Indian bonds, foreign inflows so far this month have amounted to about $3 billion. The rampant buying comes after months of persistent selling by foreign portfolio managers, including a net withdrawal of about $4 billion from Indian equities in February. On Tuesday, Indian equities’ winning streak reached seven days. All the buying has erased the losses for the calendar year so far, and comes after over $1 trillion was erased from the value of the equity market since its September peak. The trough reflected weak corporate earnings and foreign capital outflows. Despite the recovery, analysts warn the next set of Trump tariffs, set to kick in on April 2, could impact the rupee. “If tariffs come to have a substantial economic impact,” ANZ’s Nim said, “I think the most natural course of action should be to let the rupee weaken, as that can absorb a part of that shock.” India was on a list of countries of “particular interest” to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative when it requested public comments on trade tariffs. “We estimate India would potentially lose about $6 billion (0.16% of GDP) in exports to the US at 10% broad tariffs, with this rising to about $31 billion at 25% tariffs,” brokerage Emkay Global said in a note on Tuesday. ANZ’s Nim said India’s central bank has allowed the rupee to considerably appreciate, potentially creating “headroom” for depreciation. “If tariffs hit and [the currency] depreciates to 87.5, it is still familiar territory,” he said. “But if it goes beyond 88 or 89, then imported inflation becomes something to worry about. … The RBI rule of thumb is a 5% depreciation (in the rupee) leads to a 35 basis point bump in inflation.”",

    "description": "DeepSeek, symbolic of&nbsp;Chinese AI ingenuity, has helped the Hang Seng Tech Index surge&nbsp;around 25% since the start of 2025. © Reuters Version improves on predecessor and outperforms U.S. rival in some tasks CISSY ZHOU March 26, 2025 11:38 JST HONG KONG — Chinese AI startup DeepSeek quietly released an update to its V3 large language model on Tuesday evening, significantly enhancing its reasoning capabilities and further escalating competition with U.S. rival OpenAI. Dubbed DeepSeek-V3-0324, the updated model has improved significantly over its predecessor, especially in advanced math and coding, according to the company’s post on Hugging Face, a U.S. open-source AI community. Benchmark tests show DeepSeek’s latest model outperforms GPT-4.5 in coding and mathematical reasoning, while GPT-4.5 remains the strongest overall in knowledge-based tasks. The new V3 model further optimizes the writing level of Chinese writing tasks based on its R1 model, with a particular focus on improving the content quality of medium-to-long-form text creation, according to DeepSeek. “From a purely technical perspective, there isn’t a major breakthrough in DeepSeek’s update compared to its previous versions, and I think all models will continue to update rapidly, but the impact won’t be as significant as the leap from zero to one,” said Eugene Lee, a Hong Kong-based AI engineer. “However, as an open-source model, DeepSeek’s updated capabilities matching GPT-4.5 are relatively rare,” he said. After taking the tech world by storm in January with its cheap-to-train but robust AI model, DeepSeek has become the poster child for Chinese AI ingenuity. The startup’s meteoric rise has rekindled optimism about Chinese innovation and bolstered Beijing’s commitment to supporting its tech players. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma were among the Chinese tech entrepreneurs who attended a high-profile gathering with Chinese President Xi Jinping last month, further fueling a tech market rally around China’s AI advancement. The Hang Seng Tech Index has surged around 25% since the start of the year.",

Han Duck-soo said Wednesday that 18 people, including four firefighters, have died in the fires and 23,000 people were evacuated from their homes. He added that 244 wildfires have occurred in South Korea this year, 2.4 times more than by the same time last year. Also, 17,000 hectares of woodland and 209 locations, such as homes and factories, have been destroyed. To combat the fires, Han said 4,652 personnel have been activated, as well as 128 helicopters, with additional support from the U.S. military stationed in South Korea. “We are fighting the worst wildfires in history using all the manpower and equipment that we can mobilize but the situation is dire,” Han said, according to a release from his office. Han expressed thanks to all emergency personnel and government workers who are engaged in battling and dealing with the fallout from the blazes. “The whole nation is watching as you work to protect your hometowns, your families and your neighbors,” he said. Wildfires tend to occur in the spring in South Korea, a time of strong winds and dry weather conditions. Officials have not pinpointed a cause of this year’s exceptionally severe blazes, but Han said Wednesday that fires lit by locals to incinerate waste are the main cause of wildfires. This week’s weather forecast is for continued dry conditions and only a low chance of rain. The disaster is taking place at a time of political chaos in South Korea, created by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s botched attempt at instituting emergency martial law in early December. Yoon is currently awaiting a Constitutional Court verdict that will either formally remove or return him to office. He was impeached in December and a verdict in his case has been hotly anticipated for weeks, since the court held its final hearing in his case in late February. Han resumed duties as acting president on Monday when the same court that will rule on Yoon’s fate decided to reject his impeachment and restore him to office. Opposition lawmakers voted to impeach Han in December, after he was named acting leader following Yoon’s impeachment.",

    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has added more than 50 Chinese companies to an export control list. © Reuters Move targets advanced computing and hypersonic weapon capabilities KENJI KAWASE March 26, 2025 11:18 JST HONG KONG — U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has significantly expanded the trade blacklist it inherited from the previous Joe Biden team, aiming to further constrict China’s capabilities to develop artificial intelligence and advanced computing, as well as direct military technologies like hypersonic missiles. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Commerce Department has added 80 organizations to the Entity List for actions “contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy.” The additions to the blacklist include entities from the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Iran and even Taiwan, but most are either Chinese or linked to China. BIS, in an announcement released Tuesday in Washington, identified a key objective of preventing the Chinese Communist Party from gaining the ability to “acquire and develop high-performance and exascale computing capabilities, as well as quantum technologies, for military applications.” Exascale computing is the latest supercomputer technology enabling further development of AI. It describes computing at speeds of at least 1 exaflop, or 1 quintillion floating-point calculations per second. Another goal was to “impede China’s development of its hypersonic weapons program,” essentially, weapons that travel five times the speed of sound or faster and boast enhanced maneuverability to evade defenses. Military vehicles carrying DF-17 hypersonic missiles&nbsp;drive past Beijing’s Tiananmen Square during a National Day parade in October 2019. &nbsp; © Reuters “American technology should never be used against the American people,” Jeffrey I. Kessler, undersecretary for industry and security at the Commerce Department, said in the statement. He stressed that the Trump administration is “sending a clear, resounding message” to safeguard national security “by preventing U.S. technologies and goods from being misused for high-performance computing, hypersonic missiles, military aircraft training, and UAVs that threaten our national security.” The Commerce Department also listed the Test Flying Academy of South Africa (TFASA) to prevent the use of “U.S. items to train Chinese military forces.” Apart from China, the expanded list is also intended to “disrupt Iran’s procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related defense items.” Kessler added that the Entity List is “one of many powerful tools at our disposal to identify and cut off foreign adversaries seeking to exploit American technology for malign purposes.” China had not responded to the U.S. announcement as of publication time.",

    "description": "Ukraine's coast guard on patrol as&nbsp;a cargo ship passes by in the Black Sea in 2024. © Reuters Moscow wants Washington to 'order' Kyiv to follow deal March 26, 2025 01:55 JST WASHINGTON/MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) —&nbsp;The United States said on Tuesday it has reached separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea and to implement a ban on attacks by the two countries on each other’s energy facilities. The agreements, if implemented, would represent the clearest progress yet toward&nbsp;a wider ceasefire that Washington sees as a steppingstone toward&nbsp;peace talks to bring an end to Russia’s 3-year-old&nbsp;war in Ukraine. Russia, however, said it could not trust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&nbsp;and it could therefore only sign a Black Sea deal if Washington issued an “order” to him to respect it. “We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskyy and his team to do one thing and not the other,” Foreign Minister Sergey&nbsp;Lavrov said in televised comments. It was not immediately clear whether Moscow’s demand risked derailing the deal. Zelenskyy&nbsp;has previously said Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sent his army into Ukraine in February 2022, is not to be trusted over peace moves. Ukrainian Defense Minister&nbsp;Rustem Umerov said Kyiv had agreed to both a maritime ceasefire and a pause by Russia and Ukraine in attacks on each other’s energy infrastructure. But he said Kyiv would regard any movement of Russian military vessels outside the eastern part of the Black Sea as a violation and a threat. In this case Ukraine would have the full right to exercise self-defense, he said. Seeking to fulfill a pledge by President Donald Trump to end the war quickly, the U.S. originally proposed a full 30-day ceasefire — to which Ukraine agreed in principle on March 11 — as a step toward&nbsp;peace talks. But the Americans held separate talks in Saudi Arabia with Russia and Ukraine this week to discuss more limited ceasefires on energy and at sea, after Putin responded to the wider truce plan with a long list of conditions and questions. Trump is pressing both sides to bring a swift end to the war, something he promised to achieve when he ran for president last year. At the same time he is pursuing a rapid rapprochement with Moscow that both sides say could lead to lucrative business opportunities and cooperation across a wide range of areas, from minerals to sports and space exploration. Ukraine and its European allies fear Trump could strike a hasty deal with Putin that undermines their security and caves in to Russian demands, including for Kyiv to abandon its NATO ambitions and give up the entirety of four regions claimed by Russia as its own. Ukraine has rejected that as tantamount to surrender.",

    "description": "Ecosystems in the Southern Ocean, the body of water surrounding Antarctica, are under threat from climate change. The area's inhabitants, from whales to krill to phytoplankton, face changes such as a loss in sea ice and rising ocean temperatures. If species that are unique to the area, such as the Antarctic toothfish, dwindle in population as a result, this decrease could affect fishery operations and lead to cascading socioeconomic and geopolitical consequences.",

On Wednesday night at TD Garden, the world figure skating championships paused between events for something far more profound than medals or scores: a solemn tribute to the 28 members of the skating community who died in January when American Eagle flight 5342 crashed into the Potomac River . Held after the women’s short program and before the start of the pairs’ short program, the ceremony honored the skaters, coaches and parents who were returning from a development camp held in conjunction with the US figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas.

Wise words there from TS&nbsp;Eliot, who, to be fair, never had to rebuild a high-end Premier League team while also dealing with closing out a title race, natural era-wastage, and losing your most successful homegrown player since the glory days of Phil Thompson waving the&nbsp;European Cup around in the pub and all that. For Liverpool supporters it seems likely the next month will bring a wildly varying emotional register. Departures and farewells. Winning the league in front of actual non-quarantined humans.

There is no name in football more evocative than that of Braseew, its mere mention conjuring images of brawls , backyard misadventures and jogo bonito (sponsored by Nike). Even José Mourinho, at his most davkanik joyless, was moved to note that “a team without a Brazilian isn’t a team” – though given he said that after signing Fred, still missing crucial penalties for him almost a decade later , perhaps it was part of some dastardly plan of pathological, exhibition self-sabotage.

    "description": "She was the youngest ever US figure skating champion at 13 before leaving it all behind. Now Alysa Liu is back at this week’s world championships with a renewed purpose Alysa Liu looks back on the ice as rotates on her left foot, picking up speed before she completes her triple flip-triple toe combination. A group of high schoolers on a field trip sitting in the stands erupts into applause. She gives a smile and small bow as she skates away. It’s a recovery day for her, starting with dynamic stretching and cardio before moving onto the ice with her jumps, spins, and footwork. She drives herself to the rink for a two-hour skating session. Later this afternoon, she plans to attend her brother’s basketball game. If you had asked Liu a year and a half ago if she would be preparing for another figure skating world championships, she would have told you that you were crazy. Continue reading...",

In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL’s Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether. At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player. She failed countless times before she began to soar. Continue reading...",

Recovery Starts With Us, a public awareness campaign, is one of three Indy Arts Council initiatives that aims to address the prevalence of addiction and substance use disorder in Marion County, Indiana. Photo by The Basement The number of deaths from opioid overdoses in the U.S. increased tenfold from 1999 to 2022, with certain states experiencing higher overdose mortality rates. Indiana ranks in the top 15, and it is in the top 10 states for opioid prescriptions. The Indy Arts Council responded to the prevalence of addiction and substance use disorder in its community with three initiatives, all of which were funded in part by the city of Indianapolis’ opioid litigation settlement, secured through lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. One of these initiatives is Arts for Awareness, which began by funding projects that use arts-based activities that aim to prevent or build awareness of substance abuse in Marion County, of which Indianapolis is the county seat. In July 2024, Indy Arts Council announced the first four Arts for Awareness grant recipients: one artist, two arts organizations, and one residential recovery center. Projects could be conducted by nonprofits or individual artists, but they require that artists and addiction and substance abuse experts collaborate. In fall 2024, it was announced the Arts for Awareness program was one of nine arts and health projects that would receive a non-matching $150,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to expand its work beyond grantmaking. &nbsp; Funds from the Arts Endowment will allow the Indy Arts Council to contract with arts organizations which will collaborate with substance abuse experts to develop arts-based projects that aim to prevent and/or create awareness around addiction. They will also convene an advisory group, which will include the City of Indianapolis’s Office of Public Health and Safety and the Marion County Public Health Department, to ensure that the projects are following evidence-based practices. Together the advisory group and participating Arts for Awareness partners will come together for four discussion-based, in-person convenings to share knowledge, enhance ongoing work, and provide case studies for others to use when designing similar programs. As a local arts agency, the Indy Arts Council is uniquely positioned to bring together government entities with the arts community to address public health concerns. “Because substance use disorder has been such a prevalent issue in Indiana and Indianapolis, I think we are primed to try different things and try new things and create these partnerships,” said Nikki Kirk, Indy Arts Council’s director of community impact and strategic investment. “[Indy Arts Council is] in a really good position to bridge the gap between artists and arts organizations’ work and city officials and health departments’ work to really build cohesion for this type of programming.” Indy Arts Council's \"Recovery Starts with Us\" Campaign. Original artwork by Scott Johnson Dove Recovery House for Women, one of the first Arts for Awareness grantees, is the largest residential recovery center for women suffering from substance abuse in the state of Indiana. They are using their Arts for Awareness grant to integrate music therapy and art groups into their existing treatments. Women in the program will have the opportunity to share artwork or music developed during their sessions with the community in order to change the narrative through sharing real stories around substance abuse and those who suffer from it. Research, including that supported by the NEA, has found that the arts benefit people’s health—physical, cognitive, social, and emotional—and can specifically assist with the treatment and substance abuse prevention. Kirk said Indy Arts Council has benefited from public health and city officials embracing the arts role in this arena. “What they recognize is that these creative activities are really essential to supporting overall wellness, especially as it relates to mental health issues,” she said. In addition to ensuring the interventions used by grantees are backed by the healthcare community, Kirk said they are also using data to ensure these projects are reaching those who need it most. “When we come into this programming, we're making sure that we are identifying those that are most impacted by this disease, utilizing those target audiences and the data from our health departments and from our coroner's office to really make sure that this is reaching the people that it needs to reach.” “[Substance abuse] is a city epidemic. It's a state epidemic. It's a national epidemic,” she said. “So it's something that we all have to walk into together. To make sure that everybody's voice is at the table, heard, and represented is really important. We're making sure to base everything in the data that we are receiving from our health partners and in the expertise that we have from our artists and arts organizations—what their programming and impact looks like directly—to make sure that this is a really true and fruitful partnership.” Artistic Field Local Arts Agencies Blog Tag Grants Teaser Text A look at how Indy Arts Council is combatting substance abuse with the help of the arts.

(Faiga) , 1994, part of Muriel Hasbun’s Saints and Shadows series. PHOTO © MURIEL HASBUN Photography has the ability to freeze a fleeting moment, visually fixing a particular place and time in a single, immutable frame. Photographer Muriel Hasbun, on the other hand, has managed to expand her art form in such a way that her pieces move beyond mere moments, instead encapsulating entire family histories, diasporas, and cultural movements. Hasbun uses her work to explore her family’s unusual lineage and the tensions of her native El Salvador, often mixing historic photographs with multiple exposures to evoke the many layers of her personal story.&nbsp; Hasbun, a former Fulbright Scholar whose work has been exhibited around the world, spoke with the National Endowment for the Arts back in 2013 on how inspiration figures into her career. Today, we're revisiting her reflections to offer you five bits of wisdom on the different ways of looking at inspiration.&nbsp; Work hard: \"I think that bodies of work, or some sort of insight, usually come because you’ve been toiling away for a long time, and consistently. It’s a process of figuring out what your sources are, figuring out what it is that you’re trying to say—a lot of play and a lot of work.\" Be patient: \"I work over time. Nothing comes quickly. It seems that my process is one where I’m collecting these different little hints that I get as I progress.\" Pay attention: \"It's a combination of being open, being alert to those particular things that you’re doing and that you’re paying attention to, how it is that you’re making things, and then connecting them. In that connection, something that you never imagined comes about.\" Look within: \"Finding the subject of what the artwork will be is perhaps the hardest thing for an artist to figure out. It really entails getting to know oneself.\" Experiment: \"There was this whole issue of who am I to different people, and how is it that I can reconcile what it means to be Jewish and Arab and Latina and having grown up in El Salvador and being trilingual. My work became the place where I started to experiment and answer those questions.\" Part of Muriel Hasbun's exhibition Documented: The Community Blackboard at the Art Museum of the Americas in 2006.

    "description": "NEA Tech Check: Archival Producers Alliance Date Fri, 03/07/2025 - 12:00 Paulette Beete Thu, 03/06/2025 - 19:58 Author By Jax Deluca Teaser Image archivalproducersalliance.png Body This NEA interview series takes you on a journey across the nation to learn how leaders in the arts and cultural field are approaching the intersections of technology, culture, and society. Inspired by findings from the NEA arts and technology field scan conducted in partnership with Knight Foundation and Ford Foundation, we aim to increase public awareness of creative approaches to technology that engage local communities, explore ethical issues, and increase digital skills through the arts. Here is our conversation with Stephanie Jenkins of Archival Producers Alliance. (l-r) Jennifer Petrucelli, Rachel Antell, and Stephanie Jenkins of Archival Producers Alliance. Photo courtesy of APA NEA: Tell us about your organization. STEPHANIE JENKINS: We founded the&nbsp; Archival Producers Alliance &nbsp;(APA) in 2023 to provide a way for our field to come together, share collective knowledge, and to influence policy and effect change within the industry.&nbsp;The organization now includes hundreds of experienced producers and researchers across the country as well as internationally. Archival producers have a unique role in the film industry, as they interface with many levels of production as well as many vendors outside of the production team. An archival producer researches, sources, and manages archival material including footage, photographs, audio, text, and ephemera for use in documentary films and series, feature films, museum exhibits, commercials, and more. This process may involve research online as well as on-site at various archives, including academic, commercial, and personal collections. Specifics of an archival producer’s workflow can vary greatly, but always involve professional archival record-keeping and expertise in using search engines, finding aids, and databases. Archival producers, working in concert with a film’s director, producer, and editor, are an integral part of the story-telling team. They source unique and often never-before-seen materials that can drive the narrative and aesthetics of a project; work to verify the veracity and accuracy of primary source materials; and organize and manage archival assets to ease the editing and rights and clearances processes. NEA: Tell us about a specific program you are involved in that supports artist-driven explorations of technology. JENKINS: Our first initiative was to write and publish \"Best Practices of GenAI in Documentaries,\" the first industry-wide standard within the field to address ethics of this emerging technology. The guidelines seek to reaffirm the journalistic values that the documentary community has long held. A guiding principle of our craft has been documentary film’s implicit promise to the audience that what is presented as real is in fact real—even though that reality will, no doubt, have a point of view. We believe there is inherent worth in preserving the fact-based nature of documentary so that it will continue to be a trusted cultural resource. Further, we contend that human creativity holds unique value, and that the act of humans “bearing witness” is an integral part of the documentary genre. The APA acknowledges and welcomes many of the opportunities that Machine Learning and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) bring to filmmaking—and also realizes that this new technology comes with risks that need to be addressed. NEA: Was there a specific interest or experience that led you to including technology in your work? JENKINS: As archival producers, we spend our time researching and verifying historical audiovisual material. In the spring of 2023, we started seeing synthetic “historic” images and audio being brought into documentary productions. The images were extremely realistic and indistinguishable from actual historic images that we were bringing into projects. At that time, it was unclear to filmmakers whether they needed to be transparent about their use of the generative AI; there wasn’t any precedent so it was really the Wild West. This raised big questions and concerns for us about how documentary film would maintain the trust it has established with audiences, as well as its commitment to historical truth. So we gathered a group of archival producers and began meeting regularly to better understand how GenAI worked and how it might impact our projects as well as the historical record. The result was the creation of “ Best Practices for the Use of Generative AI in Documentaries .”&nbsp; NEA: What are some of the ways in which you have experienced arts and technology activities contributing to the wellbeing of individuals and communities? JENKINS: There are many good examples of documentary filmmakers using Generative AI to positively impact the communal well-being. A shining example of this is the work of Reuben Hamlyn and Sophie Compton, directors of&nbsp; Another Body. &nbsp;Their documentary uses GenAI with great intentionality to protect the identities of their participants, who were victims of deepfake pornography. We also want to shout out David France who similarly used GenAI to great effect in his documentary&nbsp; Welcome to Chechnya . NEA: What are ways the arts and cultural field can play a role in building the future with technology? &nbsp; JENKINS: We encourage arts organizations to take a breath when approaching emerging technology—and center their&nbsp; existing &nbsp;experience and standards when considering how to engage. We had success in drafting our Best Practices because we centered our conversations within a framework of broadly ethical standards and documentary history—and we encourage others to approach AI in much the same way. As we began writing our Best Practices, we knew that questions raised by Generative AI were on a continuum with other discussions that have been happening in documentary film for as long as people have been making documentaries. This includes ever-evolving topics such as re-creations, as well as issues around subjectivity and bias. We asked ourselves: “What makes a documentary? Why are we attached to the things we’re attached to? What are the values that the community holds across the board, if there are any?” With these in mind, we asked ourselves where GenAI fits into these topics. What emerged from these conversations was not only a written document, but a community! We wrote collaboratively with fifteen people in weekly meetings over the course of two months. Everyone pushed themselves to write and hone and clarify ideas. Through that, we also formed a tight bond. We hope that this method can provide a model to other arts organizations. NEA:&nbsp;Has technology always been a core interest to your work or practice? Is there a specific experience or cross-sector arts and technology collaboration(s) that was largely influential? JENKINS: Since we started our work looking at GenAI, others in the documentary field have been wondering why are&nbsp;archival producers&nbsp;talking about AI? As archival producers, we spend a lot of time researching and tracking down historical audiovisual material. Most of us are happiest in dusty archives and looking through old newspapers, not thinking about Large Language Models! A key part of our job, however, is confirming the veracity of primary sources. Once we saw that veracity itself could be questioned when “historical-looking” GenAI elements, which can be indistinguishable from primary sources, moved into documentaries, we knew we needed to stake a claim. Doing this work has embedded us even deeper into our passion for primary sources and given us tools to understand why they are so essential for documentary storytelling. It also has pushed us to question assumptions about what the nature of “truth” even is. NEA:&nbsp;How can small or mid-sized arts organizations get involved with this work, if coming to it for the first time? Why should they not feel intimidated, and how can they explore these tools/activities even on a modest budget or with more limited resources? JENKINS: We believe that any assessment of a new technology should come from&nbsp; within &nbsp;the community that will be impacted by it. GenAI tools were not developed by artists or arts organizations— nor was their creation guided by their needs, values, or best interests. Decisions on how or if to use them need to come from the people who have put years into building the field. You should never feel you need to be a tech expert to decide if or how you will use the technology. AI does not move at a human pace, but it is ok that we do. It is important to remember that we are all experts of our own jobs and our own lives—and can speak with authority on those. When our core values are at the center of the discussion, they can provide a lens through which to assess how or if to engage with the technology. NEA: Please share some arts and technology-related tips, forums, online communities, or resources that you’d recommend for readers to check out. &nbsp; JENKINS: The extraordinary Starling Lab out of Stanford University has compiled a set of&nbsp; Standard Setting Bodies &nbsp;around AI policy. See if this can help! Knowing Machines does a fantastic job of compiling essential information about Generative AI in a very crowded media environment. We suggest reading their Synthetic Media Media and Generative AI Legal Explainer. For excellent and transparent uses of GenAI technology, we suggest watching&nbsp; Another Body &nbsp;and&nbsp; Welcome to Chechnya. &nbsp;Rachel Antell, Stephanie Jenkins and Jennifer Petrucelli are co-directors and co-founders of the Archival Producers Alliance.

    "description": "Shake It Up: The Benefits of Free-Form Dance May Rival Those of Other Forms of Movement Date Thu, 03/06/2025 - 12:00 Paulette Beete Wed, 03/05/2025 - 22:15 Author By Sunil Iyengar Teaser Image Measure for Measure doodles v.2a (1).jpg Body When we talk about the arts and DIY, we commonly refer to craft activities or teaching oneself how to play a musical instrument. But what could be more DIY than free-form dancing? The adjective says it all. Free-form, freestyle, or free dance is a series of unstructured, personally directed movements in which creativity and improvisation are at a premium. In a recent article based on Arts Endowment-supported research, Northeastern University’s Aston McCullough asserts that free-form dancing&nbsp;should become more widely known as a healthy physical activity. To most people, after all, the option is instantly available. The starting-point for McCullough’s article—which appeared last November in PLOS One —is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans . The guidelines state that adults should do at least two-and-a-half hours of “moderate-intensity” physical activity per week. However, the guidelines also say that physical activity bouts “of any length” can contribute to health benefits, provided that the activity is of “moderate-to-vigorous” intensity. &nbsp; If this is true, then it should be possible by dancing however one would like—even on a sporadic basis—to attain levels of physical activity conducive to health gains. But how do we know that self-determined regimens of free-form dance can meet this threshold? Enter Dr. McCullough. In a small, pilot study, 48 adults between 18 and 85 years old were asked to “dance in their usual fashion” with and without music they had pre-selected. These bouts occurred for five minutes each. Twice, the subjects were asked to dance to an intensity they perceived as “moderate,” and twice to an intensity they perceived as “vigorous.” The bouts were separated by a three-minute rest period. &nbsp; The adults took lab tests before the session, and, while dancing, each wore a calorimeter and a heart monitor. It turns out that most participants were excellent judges of their physical activity levels: when asked to dance solo to a “moderate” intensity—with or without music—all managed to reach moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, as measured by percent of heart rate reserve (HRR) or metabolic equivalents (METs) used. &nbsp; When asked to dance at “vigorous” intensity, with music, 92 percent of subjects engaged in vigorous physical activity as measured by percent of HRR. Without music, it was 94 percent. In terms of METs, more than 80 percent of dancers to music rated vigorous physical activity, compared with 58 percent of those who danced without music. &nbsp; At the group level, too, “ a self-determined moderate or vigorous intensity was sufficient for eliciting a moderate-to-vigorous [physical activity] intensity,” McCullough writes. Indeed, “some participants tended to perceive they were dancing at lower intensities than were otherwise observed” via oxygen uptake or heart rate responses, he notes. Overall, preliminary evidence shows that, at the group level, absolute physical-activity levels “elicited during self-determined moderate intensity solo, free-form dance bouts are of a similar intensity to those reported for ballroom dancing with a partner, ballet barre sequences, modern dance classes and performances, and other modes of [physical activity, or PA] like bicycling at 9.4 mph or walking backwards at 3.5 mph,” the article concludes. Moreover, no dance-specific training is required, McCullough adds. “Free-form dancing is immediately accessible to most everyone, and it is a [physical activity] mode that is unhampered by PA barriers such as neighborhood walkability.” I might just stop here to wriggle around in my cubicle.

    "description": "Terence Blanchard: A Life in Music—Part Two Download Audio Transcript Music Credits: “NY” composed and performed by Kosta T, from the cd Soul Sand . Used courtesy of the Free Music Archive. Terence Blanchard, Live at Monterey Jazz Festival, 2023. “The Water” from the album A Tale of God’s Will (a requiem for Hurricane Katrina). Composed and performed by Terence Blanchard. “I Dare You” from the album Absence Composed by Terence Blanchard, performed by the Turtle Island Quartet. “Peculiar Grace” from the opera, Fire Shut Up In my Bones . Music composed by Terence Blanchard, libretto by Kasi Lemmons, sung by Angel Blue, Metropolitan Opera, 09/27/2021. Jo Reed: From the National Endowment for the Arts, this is Art Works I’m Josephine Reed. This is part two of my 2023 conversation with NEA Jazz Master Terence Blanchard. In our last episode, we explored his early years in New Orleans, his time with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, and his evolution as a composer and bandleader. Today, we continue the conversation by looking at the many ways Terence has expanded his artistry—with his groups, through opera, and his role as artistic director of SFJAZZ. We’ll talk about his album Absence dedicated to NEA Jazz Master Wayne Shorter, and how composing for opera pushed him into new creative territory. We’ll also explore his passion for music education and the ways he’s helped shape the next generation of jazz musicians. But first, we turn to one of the most defining moments of his life both personally and artistically—Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the United States killing over 1,800 people and devastating much of New Orleans. Katrina and its aftermath became the subject of Spike Lee’s four-part documentary, When the Levees Broke , which was scored by Terence. Terence was living in LA [Los Angeles] as well as New Orleans and brought his family, including his mother, to California before the hurricane hit. Their return to New Orleans became a part of the documentary. Terence Blanchard: When we did When the Levees Broke , man, it was tough. It was tough for a lot of reasons. We were living uptown at the time, and the house that we had there, we didn't have water damage. We had broken windows because of the wind, and got all of that repaired. But what was crazy about that was when I worked on 4 Little Girls and the visuals of that and the storyline, when it would get too heavy for me, I would take a break and I would come down and hang out or go to the park, go bike riding or whatever. I couldn't do that when the levies broke, because I was really stepping right into what it was I was looking at in my studio. So that was a rough time. And then to go through the thing of taking my mom back to the house was probably one of the hardest things I had to do other than bury my father, because she was holding out hope that nothing had happened to the house, and I had already been to the house. I went the night before just on my own, and I saw the devastation, and I couldn't say anything to her. I had to let her experience it herself.&nbsp; It was rough. That was hard. Spike didn't even come in. He stayed outside. It was hard for everybody that was there. We worked together, but we're family. You know what I mean? And they're seeing my house that I grew up in destroyed. But then when I started to see the documentary, I was totally amazed at what Spike put together. Initially, it was supposed to be a two-hour documentary, two hours, but there was so much information, we couldn't leave it there. We just had to expand it. But our budget stayed at a two-hour budget. So basically, we all worked for free at a certain point, but we were all committed to it. And I told Spike this, and it's probably one of the most comprehensive things I've ever seen done on this area, because there's so many different cultures and facets here. He had all of those things combined in this one piece. And that's the way that I tried to approach it in scoring it. But the most important thing was I was just thankful for him to do it. Jo Reed: But then you also came out with the album A Tale of God's Will: A Requiem for Katrina building on some of the themes you used in When The Levees Broke . Terence Blanchard: Yes. Jo Reed: Tell me about the story that you felt like you wanted to tell with that album. Terence Blanchard: Well, it was more that I couldn't get past the whole notion of what had happened to my city. Just seeing all that type of stuff in your hometown, it's something you never imagine, you never want to see again. But then it just frustrates you. And while I appreciated what Spike had done, I felt like I needed to make my own statement about it. And we started working on it, and the guys were creating their tunes and arrangements, and there was so much magic that was happening. It was crazy. I don't know who said it first, and I can't remember, but one of us started chanting, “this is a tale of God's will.” It just came out nowhere. We didn't have a title for the album at all. And once that started to happen, man, everything just started to fall into place for that album. And when we released that album, people were telling us how the music had affected them and how it helped them get through the grieving process. Jo Reed: And A Tale of God's Will was the first Grammy you won as a leader. Terence Blanchard: Yeah, it was interesting, the Tale of God . It was interesting because A Tale of God's Will was the first Grammy that I'd ever won in my life as a leader. And it was powerful. It just meant a lot because we didn't create the album for that. You know what I mean? But being recognized still meant a lot. So it was a powerful moment in time, for sure. Jo Reed: And you addressed the impact of Katrina through your role as an educator….The Monk Institute is a multi-faceted organization dedicated to music education and you were instrumental in bringing the institute to New Orleans. Terence Blanchard: Yeah. When I worked with The Monk Institute, I loved all of the work that we would do in the high schools. Granted, I love working with the students themselves. They were semi-pro soon to be pro musicians. But I was really excited about sending those guys out into the high schools and middle schools. So when we talked about bringing it to New Orleans, that meant a lot to me because I knew at that time that there were kids that were suffering, struggling here. When you go through something that's traumatic like that, I went through Hurricane Betsy as a kid. I remember stepping off of my porch being picked up. I was about four years old being picked up and put into a boat. And (we) couldn't find my dad for a couple of days, and we were staying in somebody's front room of a house sleeping on the floor. So come on, I'm four years old and I still have that's stuck in my head. So I knew that there were kids here that were in dire straits, right? And I also knew that music could probably be one of the things to help them. So that's why I wanted the Monk Institute to come to New Orleans. And sure enough, when we started sending our kids out into the high schools and the middle schools, they started to help a lot of kids here. That's what my life turned around in terms of why I create music. When you see the power in it and how it can help people deal with these tough topics like this, you start to feel a responsibility to address these things, because all of my mentors are gone. You look around and you go, well, who else is here but us? So we need to address this stuff. Jo Reed: But of course, you more than anyone are capable of doing more than one thing simultaneously. And the album Absence is your love letter to Wayne Shorter, it features your group E-Collective and The Turtle Island Quartet and I think it needs some flowers in this conversation. Terence Blanchard: No, thank you for saying that. Man, I love Wayne Shorter so much that I had to do something to let him know that before he passed, and the thing about doing an album for Wayne, which is the way him and Herbie both are, they don't want you to just do their tunes. No. What do you see? How do you see it? How do you perceive it? What's your idea? You know what I mean? So we did a mixture of some of his tunes and some originals. And man, we got a chance to go and hang out with Wayne before we recorded. Now, I had been around Wayne a number of times. Obviously I've been on him for a long time. But some of the guys in the group, it was their first time being around him. And Wayne is the type of dude, he just gives you a life lesson of just a general conversation. And I'll never forget when we left the house, we were standing outside the house. We hadn't gone anywhere. And the guys were like, \"Thank you, man. Thank you for this. Thank you, thank you.\" Jo Reed: You talk about life lessons. Please, please convey the one where he said to you, “It takes courage to be happy.” Because I read that, and that was a life lesson for me. Like fourth hand. Terence Blanchard: Right? Yeah. Well, I was playing at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. Jazz and Heritage Festival, and Wayne was there. And just in typical fashion, I don't even know how the subject came up, he starts to tell me about some violinist who never would win an audition for an orchestra, because she played real aggressive, and her style didn't mix with other string players. And she had gotten to the point of having so much rejection that she was at a low point in her life, almost at a point where she wanted to commit suicide. And her mother called her, and just like any mom could hear something was wrong with her child, and her child wouldn't say anything. And then the mom goes, “Well, it takes courage to be happy.” And when Wayne told me that story, man, I had been trying to, the best way I can explain it is that I was trying to live up to an image that wasn't real. It wasn't me. It was what I thought a jazz musician should be, right? And man, when he said that, it was like something was lifted off to my shoulders. And I went, \"Oh, Right. It takes courage to be happy.\" It brought me back to something that a great musician in New Orleans, Alvin Baptiste, said to me, he said, \"Man, the easiest thing to do is to learn how to play like John Coltrane.\" He says, \"Because everybody loves John Coltrane.\" He said, \"The hardest thing to do is to be yourself. But that's what being an artist really is.\" So when Wayne told me that story, my mind went right back to that, and I went, right, okay. So now the question becomes, so then who am I really? Who am I really? I had been already moving down that road, but I was trying to fit it within an aesthetic. And when Wayne told me that the walls came tumbling down, everything became a possibility for me then. Jo Reed: The composition you wrote for the album Absence is “I Dare You.” And that's an important title, a very significant one. Terence Blanchard: Yeah, it's a very important title for a number of reasons, because the tune itself, it's a tune that I'd written to prove a point to my students about. You can make a tune out of two notes. (Terence scats) Jo Reed: I kept thinking of Beethoven's Fifth . Terence Blanchard: Okay, well, okay, okay. Right. Okay. So what's funny about that is that when I introduced it to the audience, we play a stretch of tunes, and I try to remind 'em of what they heard. And I said, \"Do you remember that kind of funky Beethoven us thing that we start with?\" I said, \"That's one of my tunes.\" And what's crazy about that to me is because that the introduction was written the morning of the day, we recorded that introduction was written the morning of the day. We recorded the tune because I noticed we didn't have anything for, I said, \"I woke up early one morning.\" I said, \"We need something for this beginning of the tune.\" So I wrote that string introduction that morning and brought it in. And the title comes from something that Wayne said when he was asked by Tavis Smiley, what does jazz mean? And Wayne said, “Jazz means I dare you.” And it was another one of those life lessons you say, I dare you. And I'm like, \"See, that's what I'm talking about. It takes courage to be happy. I dare you.\" You know what I mean? And it's one of those things where in the Buddhist philosophy is like to fight, to fight for your potential. To keep moving ahead. Wayne was a prime example of that. So it's kind of how I'm trying to live my life through his examples. Jo Reed: What led to you composing opera? Were you fulfilling this suppressed longing? Terence Blanchard: Oh, man. No way. No way. When it came to writing opera, that was not something that was even on the plate whatsoever. I always tell a joke, when Jim Robinson came and asked me, he said, we want you to write an opera. I kind of leaned across the table to smell his breath. I'm like, is this dude drunk? What's going on, man? You want me to write an opera? That's some of the funniest stuff I've ever heard. But I got to tell you though, I'm always up for a challenge. So I called Roger Dickerson again, \"Roger, they want me to do this.\" Boom. And once I started, it was, man, it was such a journey because I didn't know what I was doing, but I kept saying to myself, just write what feels right. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, you still have another career. Jo Reed: And Jim Robinson was artistic director of Opera Theatre of St Louis? Terence Blanchard: Yes. And opera theater, St. Louis man, they were amazing. They really stepped me through the process. You work workshopping it, dealing with the voices, understanding when music should be turned in, understanding how to do a piano vocal score so we could rehearse. And then finally getting down to the final thing, man, it was a process, but the payoff is so incredible. I can't explain it to you. You sit in a room, you sit at a piano by yourself for two years crafting this story, and you kind of see images in your mind. But then all of a sudden, there are people who are singing these lines like sound familiar to you. And they're walking around the stage, and all of a sudden now they have costumes on and there's lighting. It blows my mind. So I've been telling people recently, \"I'm looking forward to doing my third opera now,\" but probably when I'm in the middle of it, I'm going to be like, \"Man, what the hell was I thinking?\" Jo Reed: Well, your first opera was Champion based on the life of Emil Griffith who was a boxer and he was gay. What attracted you to that story? Terence Blanchard: I found out about Emil Griffith from my best friend, and he knows I'm a fight fan. And he had talked to me about Emile Griffith, and he told me about the book Nine, Ten and Out . So I think the thing that got me about Emile's story, I thought about the time that I won my first Grammy They called my name. I turned to my wife without thinking, give her a kiss and a hug, and I go up and receive my award. And I'm thinking, this guy became welterweight champion of the world and could never really celebrate that openly with anybody that he loved. Makes no sense to me. And what was beautiful about doing it with opera theater St. Louis, is that in order to promote the opera, we did a lot of civic stuff. I went to a lot of organizations, spoke to them, the gay and lesbian community, the sport in the sports world. We had panel discussions. We did a lot of stuff. And it brought everybody out in St. Louis to experience it. People from the health community that deal with dementia, they were there. And everybody was just thankful that there was something that treated these topics with dignity and allowed us to talk about. So that, again, was a powerful thing for me. But the most important thing was I got hooked. I hate to say it, I hate to say it, Jim, but I got hooked. You know what I mean? I don't consider myself an opera composer, and they keep telling me, \"Dude, you're an opera composer. Get over it.\" I am hooked on how it all comes together. My favorite part is when we get into the theater in rehearsal and you see it and you can kind of understand what's going on, but they don't have the wardrobe yet lighting. And when you get into the theater and the lights and the, oh my God, and it just starts to come, and then it really doesn't really pop until that performance, the premiere. There's something that happens to those guys when that curtain goes up, boom. They click into another world, man with all of a sudden everything just gets raised up a notch, and it's an amazing experience to have in your life.&nbsp; Jo Reed: I have to think that all your experience in scoring films really helped you when it came for you to sit down with an opera. Terence Blanchard: My experience in the film world helped me tremendously in the operatic world because I wasn't so concerned about writing for orchestra. I had that under my belt, and creating sonic colors for certain situations was fine. The problem was writing for voice. And the most problematic part is different from singing to singing. They can all be sopranos, but they're different. Sopranos all be baritones and all be different. So that part was the part that took some time to learn. But when you learn that for a specific singer, oh man, it turns everything around. Just knowing, knowing the abilities of the singers to be able to do those things, that's when the storytelling process really becomes a big deal. I'm a big Puccini fan, and the thing that I love about Puccini is that I love how the melody line develops with the story. They're intertwined, and that's what I've been trying to do. I also try to make the musical lines feel natural. So I would spend a lot of time, I would spend a lot of time reading the libretto out loud, and when I would read the libretto out loud, I would hear the rhythms and what it was that I was reading, and I would write that under the libretto. One of the other things that I had to learn about the human voice is that being a trumpet player, to hit those high notes, we have to hit those on demand. Right? Well, with singers, they can do that, but a lot of times they want to run up to the note. So you have to take that into consideration when you're writing, especially if you want it to be big at a certain point of the storyline. All those things play a factor in how you develop your melody lines. Jo Reed: Well, Champion was very well received, and then comes opera number two. Fire Shut Up in My Bones based on the memoir by Charles Blow. So what is the origin story for that particular opera? Terence Blanchard: My wife knew of the book F ire Shut Up in My Bones and asked me to read it. I was floored by a few things in the book. First I, I'm a big fan of Charles Blow, loved his writing, loved him as a commentator. Still think he's probably one of the smartest people out there. But then you read the book and you go, man, he's from Gibbon, Louisiana. Oh man. And then you find out that he was molested as a kid, and you go, wow, that was unfortunate. But then you look at his life and you go, but that dude came through that in a way that's so impressive. We have to do this story. Jo Reed: Fire In My Bones opened in 2019 at the Opera Theater of St. Louis, and then you get a phone call from the Metropolitan Opera. Terence Blanchard: Yeah, I get a phone call from a friend of mine named Peter Gelb, and he goes, “Hey man, we want to do your opera at the Met”. And I went, \"Excuse me.\" You have to remember, I never really saddled up for this musical journey in my life. So while this is all taken off this, it's kind of unreal for me in a sense. Then all of a sudden now, the production has gone from being this one little thing to being this huge production at The Met. I remember walking into the rehearsal for the first day, and it was about 50 singers in the room, and I went, \"Whoa.\" And I'm the only dude in there that couldn't sing. You know what I mean? It was like, oh, man. But the beautiful thing about it was everybody was on the same page as to the purpose, the importance of it. We had a round table discussion the first day of rehearsal, and there was a lot of tears, a lot of tears, people saying things like, this is the first role they've ever done that they can relate to. One of the young kids said it gave him hope because he was bullied at school because he wanted to be an opera singer, but he felt safe in our community. He was around so many people like him. I knew this, but it didn't really click until I had a conversation with the late Arthur Woodley, who was a great baritone, and we were talking about how a lot of African American singers grew up in a church or sang R&amp;B or jazz, and they were told to turn all of that off to sing opera. And then it hit me that day of that first day at a rehearsal where we had the round table. I'm like, wait a minute. This is a current story. This is an American story. So I told the singers, I said, listen, whatever your background is, bring all of that to this man in Angel Blue . She did it on this aria “Peculiar Grace”. She asked me, are you okay with me doing some things? I'm like, sure. Because she grew up in a church singing a church. Lemme tell you something. When she sang, I think in rehearsal, everybody was in tears. It was powerful. I think what she sang was beautiful. Don't get me wrong. But I think the reason why we were all in tears was because it was like we've been avoiding this for how long? But it made total sense, and it was who she was as a person who has a deep faith, and man that turned everything around, turned everything around for everybody&nbsp; Jo Reed: Fire Shut Up in My Bones opened the 2021–22 season at the Metropolitan Opera—the first opera staged there after the long Covid closure and it was first opera by a Black composer to be performed by the Met, ever. Which shocked the hell out of everybody so for you, it had to have been on one hand \"Oh my God, my opera is at the Met and like, oh my God, are you kidding me?\" Terence Blanchard: Oh, definitely. That was definitely it. I was like, I was at the Met. It was just incredible. And then I'm like, I forgot the journalist who called me, he said, \"How do you feel being the first African-American to have an opera at the Met?\" I'm like, \"What?\" I didn't believe him. I'm like, go back and check that. That can't be true. Then not only was it true, but then I'm doing an interview on television and they bring me a ledger of operas that were rejected and William Grant Still's name is in there three times. Three times. And I had just heard one of those operas the summer before in St. Louis and thought it was hip and amazing. Didn't know what it was. I'm like, well, man, what is this? And they said, oh, that's William Grant Still's Highway 1 . I went, man, that's kind of cool. I love that. So the thing that was so crazy about that period in my life, I kept telling people, man, okay, I'm the first African American to have an opera at the Met, but I'm not the first qualified African American to have an opera at the Met. Let's just be real about it. They were many other guys who were well qualified to have that moniker. So while I'm proud of it, but it comes with a mixed bag of emotions. Opera is the highest form of musical theater you could ever experience. That's the way I look at it, and I think with all of the talent out there, man, the possibilities are endless to create stories and tell stories that could be really intriguing to a fan base. Jo Reed: What was opening night like at the Met? What was the feeling like in that house, on the stage? Terence Blanchard: I was emotionally just blown away at the level of support that was shown to us. People came out dressed to the nines. It was incredible. And I had never been that nervous before in my life, because this is the Met. This thing could really bomb. But when those guys started to sing, I felt like I was in good hands, if that makes sense. I knew that they were stepping up to the plate. They understood what was at stake. Right. And like I said, everything went up a notch. Everything went up a notch. All the performances to such a degree where I felt weird coming out to take a bow at the end of it. You know what I mean? I just put some notes on the page, those people that went out there and performed and did it. But to see the response from the crowd, There were so many people who had never been to the Met before, never been to opera before, who came. They were excited about it. It was probably one of the most diverse audiences they've ever seen at the Met. And one of the things that we learned is that those first timers bought tickets to other shows. Jo Reed: You are passionate about education. Terence Blanchard: Yes. Jo Reed: You have a whole career as an educator. Talk about why this is central to your artistic life. Terence Blanchard: I am the beneficiary of great teachers and great programs as well. New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts, all of the summer programs that I went to at Loyola University. Without those things, I don't know where I would be. And I see now, excuse me, I see now how important they are because we don't have a situation where guys are learning on the streets. Some people are, but guys are coming to these bands well prepared because of these systems. The guys in my jazz band with Kendrick Scott and some of those guys, they all went to Arch High School. Those arch high schools really helped shape their careers and gave them strong musical foundations, which allowed them to go out and grow and prosper. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and there was talk of taking music out of the schools, I lost it. I'm like, who would ever think of such a thing? I remember they did a study and they found that kids who were involved in music did better in math and science, just in general. So just from a productive point of view, the arts really help us develop another side of our brain. And I'd like to think that it helps us to develop the compassionate side of us – that along with these experiences as musicians, allow us to create music to help people heal. But as patrons, it allows you to get from, like Art Blakely used to say, the doldrums of everyday life.— It allows you to enter into a world where you could put aside things that are bothering you, things that are troubling you just for a moment, which could help rejuvenate your soul to get back to doing the work that you need to do. So I think it's a win-win for everybody involved, because music education is not just about creating musicians, but it's about creating a community that really appreciates the arts, I think. And I've seen what it's done for me. I'm here to tell you arts education is vital. It's vital. People don't really get it sometimes because they keep looking at the big picture. They're not understanding that this is not necessarily about creating the next Wynton Marsalis. No, it's not about that. If we do that, fine, that'd be great. But it's about creating the next productive person who understands what art is and what life is about, much bigger than what they see on the block. We want to have a world mentality. And that's what having these broader experiences for young kids does. Did it for me. Did it for everybody that I grew up with. Jo Reed: I'm wondering when you're teaching students who are at the college level who are really thinking about a career in music, how do you help them develop their own style? Terence Blanchard: Right. Well, when I'm working with kids who really want to become professional musicians, I make 'em all compose – all of them. But here's the thing. I teach them composition the way Roger taught me. So it's not necessarily about the idea, but it's how we develop the idea. So when I give 'em all of these rules about how to take their idea and runthrough all of these various permutations, they see all of these possibilities. The cool thing is, is that none of them sound the same because I'm not giving them the idea. They're taking their own ideas, and I'm showing them how to take that idea no matter how small, and blow it up into something big. An example I always use is (scats the beginning of Beethoven’s Fifth ). Four notes and it became a huge symphony. Jo Reed: And you are now the artistic director at SFJazz. What attracted you to that role? Terence Blanchard: Well, the job at SF Jazz for me, was really attractive because it's San Francisco, first of all. And when you think about music and art in San Francisco, man, there's a lot of cutting edge stuff it that's come from that area. It's been an incubator. You know what I mean? For art, for creative things, for daring things. It's getting, the tech world is kind of taking it over now in terms of the impression of what's there. But no, man, it's always been this haven for the arch for me. And Randall Kline, who was the guy who created SF Jazz, I've known him for a number of years, man, for a long time. When I first met him, he was a concert promoter. And when I saw what he built with SFJ is, I thought it was brilliant, brilliant. Had no idea I'd be working there—running a joint. But now that I'm there, I'm excited about what it is we can do. Because I wanted to be a destination spot. I want people from all over the world to come to San Francisco and check out SFJazz. We are already well entrenched in the community, and there's more things that we could do in terms of outreach to students that I'm working on. We want to go more into the schools and some communities and have a bigger footprint in those areas. But along with that, I want to offer opportunities for musicians that are kind of caught in the middle of things. You got to understand that it's a different world from when I got into the music industry. When I got in, you got signed to the label, they promoted you on radio, you were hearing you all over the place, and you could tour. That's gone. It's gone. So we have to figure out how to help some of these musicians who are not major stars, but who are not beginners. They're kind of caught in the middle a little bit. And so some of us realize we have to take a chance on them to build a relationship with audiences, and that'll happen over time. That's the reason why It's a nonprofit organization. We don't have to turn a profit, even though we do, we do extremely well. But at the same time, I am really excited about all of that. There's some technological things we're going to do. We have immersive video there. I'm excited about how we're going to incorporate that into live shows. I actually want to curate a series of matching video artists with musicians and have them collaborate on things. There's so many things coming down the pipe with SFJazz. So when you talk about why I'm there, man, it's because the sky's the limit with that organization. And I was telling some people, I said, man, I really feel like I've been given the keys to a Ferrari with SFJazz, because it's already been doing a lot of great work. I'm just coming in there and just kind of putting my take on things and trying to expand it in other areas. Jo Reed: And you have been named an NEA Jazz Master. What does that mean for you, Terence? Terence Blanchard: Well, first of all, I was not expecting that at all—the NEA Jazz Master thing because I had seen so many people receive it. When it finally dawned on me and I realized that it was real, it took me a second. It's a huge honor. It's a huge honor to be in a class with all of my heroes. It's something I didn't think of that it just never crossed my mind. And even now just talking about it, now's like the realization of it. It's overwhelming to a degree, because I remember when it started, and I remember saying to myself, finally, that's kind of cool that these guys are being recognized like this in such a way because they've been contributing so much to the world of music. And now to be in that lineup, man, ask me when it's all after the thing is done. It is kind of like going to the Met for the first time. It's like I can't really put into words what it feels like because I'm still processing the entire thing. But to suffice it to say, it's a huge, huge overwhelming honor to be amongst some of the greatest of our time. Jo Reed: And an honor so well deserved. Terence, truly. Terence Blanchard: Thank you. Jo Reed: Thank you. Thank you for everything you do. Terence Blanchard: No, thank you. I appreciate you saying that. I do. I do. And NEA Jazz Master. Wow. Jo Reed: That was part two of my conversation with 2024 NEA Jazz Master Terence Blanchard. We spoke at the end of 2023. This is my last episode of Art Works. I am off to my retirement after 696 shows…and each one has been sheer pleasure. Art Works has been possible all these years because of the support from my colleagues at the Arts Endowment, most particularly those in the Office of Public Affairs, both past and present. So here’s to Adam Kampe, Jess Sarmiento, Jamie Bennett, Carlos Arrien, Rebecca Sutton, Kelli Rogowski, Liz Auclair, David Low, Sally Gifford, Paulette Beete, Carolyn Coons, Victoria Hutter, Sonia Tower, Aunye Boone, Cliff Archuletta, Allison Hill, and especially Don Ball.
