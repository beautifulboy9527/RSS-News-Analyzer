Asked about the controversy about her decision to accept two corporate tickets for a Sabrina Carpenter concert at the O2, she repeated the line that she used at her press conference yesterday – that a family member wanted to attend the concert (presumably one of her children, but she did not say that), and that she accepted tickets for a corporate box because security concerns meant it was not deemed safe for her to get normal tickets for the auditorium. I’m just saying I wouldn’t do it again. I felt I was doing the right thing. But I do understand perceptions.

The Resolution Foundation said a combination of weak economic growth over the next five years and benefit cuts that fall disproportionately on lower-income households would result in an average £500 loss over the next five years for those in the poorest half.

    "title": "The best power banks and portable chargers for every device in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Few things are more panic-inducing than a phone’s battery hitting five percent when you’re nowhere near a charger. That’s what power banks are for. Keep a full one in your bag and you’ll never have to worry about a dead phone (or tablet or even laptop) again. For over two years, I’ve tested dozens of portable chargers, ranging from small MagSafe-compatible packs to massive 27,500-milliamp-hour bricks. Not every battery out there is a winner, and the tech seems to be steadily improving — what I’m testing in 2025 definitely outshines what I was trying out in 2022. So this guide is here to help you pick the best power bank for any situation, along with our advice on what to consider when picking out a portable charger. Table of contents Best power banks for 2025 How we test best power banks What to look for in a portable battery pack Other power banks we tested Best power banks for 2025 What to look for in a portable battery pack Battery type Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even increased in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t suffer from a memory effect (where a battery&#39;s lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges). One drawback you may have heard is the possibility of lithium ion batteries catching fire . To limit the danger, battery packs require internal mechanisms to limit things like voltage and pressure. While you should still make sure a battery isn’t exposed to unnecessary stress like excessive heat, damage from drops or operating in freezing weather, battery packs are considered safe enough to bring on an airplane. According to the TSA , external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) can fly with you – just make sure you stash them in your carryon as they aren’t allowed in checked baggage. Capacity Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick. You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent. Wireless More manufacturers are making power banks with wireless charging. Not hassling with cables is nice, but it’s important to note that wireless charging is less efficient than plugging in your phone. Outside of MagSafe options, wireless portable chargers historically didn’t make the cut for our top picks for this guide for that reason. The Qi2 wireless charging standard arrived last year and improves performance for wireless charging, including for portable banks. Currently, iPhones are the only handsets that support the new tech, but as it’s an open standard, expect Google, Samsung and others to adopt it for future phones. In my testing, I’ve noticed an uptick in the performance of non-Qi2-enabled batteries as well, so you&#39;ll now see wireless options on this list. Ports Since Apple ditched the Lightning cable and adopted USB-C, we’re getting closer to a standard for charging connections — and all of our picks have at least one such port. But plenty of other devices use older interfaces, like USB-A and microUSB ports, plus Lightning for older iPhones. You can find cables with just about any combination of those connections, so when you’re picking out a battery, just check that one end of your preferred cord will fit. Most battery packs have more than one port, which gives you different charging options. You’ll typically see at least one port labeled “in/out,” which means you can use it to both charge the bank and charge your device. While USB-A output ports can power up smartphones and other small devices, they can’t charge larger devices. Plus, they aren’t as fast as USB-C ports overall. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re deciding which ports and charging cables to use to connect your phone to the pack. There’s even more variation among USB-C ports themselves, with different ports on the same device supporting different power transfer rates. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank’s 18W port. But to properly charge, say, a MacBook or similar laptop, it’ll need the extra juice supplied by a 100W port (which larger power banks can offer). Power banks with more than one port can also charge multiple devices at the same time, but speeds and the overall charge delivered will be lower. You’ll also want to consider your charging cable. For anything larger than a smartphone (and to access fast-charging capabilities) you’ll want to use USB-C ports and cables. But not all cables are created equal, even when they have the same USB-C plugs on the end. If you want power delivery from a 100W USB-C power bank port, you’ll need a 100W-rated USB-C cable. Luckily, power banks capable of delivering 100W tend to include a compatible cable. For any devices that don’t, we’ve tried and liked Anker’s 100W USB-C cable . For smaller devices, we used this 60W cable from Nimble and we don’t recommend bothering with cables under 60W. For around $20, higher-capacity charging cables will make sure you’re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer. Design For the most part, these rechargeable batteries have a squared-off, brick-like design, though many nod towards aesthetics with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power stations include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage. How we test best power banks Before we even put our hands on a battery pack, we did extensive research. We considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and we checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then we get our hanHere’s the full list of power banks we&#39;ve tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries. Amy Skorheim for Engadget MagSafe-compatible Apple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh) Spigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh) Anker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh) Mophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh) Baseus Magnetic (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh) Anker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh) UGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh) EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic (5,000mAh)&nbsp; Low capacity (≤10,000mAh) Mophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh) Anker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh) Anker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Biolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh) Anker Nano (5,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Satechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh) Anker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh) Mid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh) Baseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh) Otterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh) Anker Prime (20,000mAh) Nestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh) Nimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh) High capacity (20,001mAh+) Mophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh) UGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh) Anker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh) Zendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Trek (27,000mAh) HyperJuice 245W (27,000mAh) Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh) Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable (25,000mAh) We&#39;re continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary.&nbsp; For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 15, an iPhone 14 Plus, an iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer). I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used this 60W-rated USB-C to USB-C cable . For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing: iPhone 11: 3,110 mAh iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh iPhone 15 : 3,349 mAh Galaxy S22 Ultra : 4,855mAh iPad Air : 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh I noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design. Other power banks we tested Anker Prime 20,000 mAh power bank Anker’s Prime bank was our previous pick for the best premium power bank, but I thought it worked best with the expensive (yet very convenient) base. Considering it also doesn’t have any built-in cables, we decided to bump the Prime battery from its position and replace it with the Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank . There’s still plenty to like about the Prime battery: it’s solid, attractive and tells you just how much charge it has left with its onboard display. When you add the optional base, you not only get a convenient drop-and-go way to recharge, it also acts as a charging hub with three additional USB ports. EcoFlow Rapid magnetic I was curious to try out the first power bank from EcoFlow, a company that primarily makes larger power stations and whole-home backup batteries . The first offering in the brand’s Rapid series is a Qi2-enabled magnetic charger with a 5,000mAh capacity . It looks quite nice with shiny silver accents and soft-touch grey plastic on the MagSafe-compatible front. There’s a little pull-out leg that sturdily displays your phone as it charges and the attached USB-C cable lets you refill devices directly, then tucks out of the way when it’s not in use. But it didn’t outperform our top pick in the MagSafe category, in terms of both charging speeds and the amount of charge delivered. Baseus Blade 2 The Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that’s just a little wider than an ereader — which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up. Anker MagGo (6.6K) Anker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some. Mophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini The Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini. Power bank FAQs What&#39;s the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger? A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery.&nbsp; There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability. Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes. Does fast charging actually ruin your battery? Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work. While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged. In short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do. Can you use a power bank for all your devices? That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.

    "description": "Not everyone needs to spend a fortune to get a mobile phone that does everything they want. The best budget Android phones prove you can snag a new phone with great performance, solid build quality and all the key features you actually care about — without the hefty price tag. You might not get a flagship device with every bell and whistle, but for most people, that’s probably just fine. Maybe you’re not chasing the latest camera system or trying to capture the perfect selfie, and instead, you just want a decent camera, a smooth AMOLED display and a battery that lasts all day. These budget-friendly phones are designed to deliver exactly that, focusing on practicality and value while still offering impressive camera quality and features that hit the right price point. If you’re ready to upgrade without breaking the bank, these are the best Android phones you can get on a budget. Table of contents Best budget Android phones for 2025 How cheap should you go for an Android? What to look for in a cheap phone Android phone FAQs Best budget Android phones for 2025 How cheap should you go for an Android? We tend to define a budget phone as costing between $150 and $350. Any lower and the device runs the risk of suffering from too many compromises, and above that, you cross over to pricier midrange handsets (if you&#39;re open to spending more, we shouted out a couple of our favorites at the very end of this guide). But for those with a little wiggle room, there are some things to consider. For example, a child may be better off with a cheaper device, especially if it’s intended mainly for emergencies or texting parents (and not social media). On the higher end of this price spectrum, sub-$350 phones have come a long way thanks to improved performance, better cameras with low-light capabilities, fast charging, and nicer displays like AMOLED panels. This makes them a viable alternative to, say, a flagship handset with a premium design, even if you have the flexibility to spend more. What to look for in a cheap phone When it comes to cheap phones, you get what you pay for. Most smartphones in this price range are made out of plastic, though the fit and finish of a specific model can vary a lot based on price. A bright screen is also important. Typically you’ll get LCD panels with a 60Hz or 90Hz refresh rate, but some phones may have OLED or AMOLED screens with increased color saturation. Long battery life is critical as well, so we tend to favor devices with larger power cells of around 5,000 mAh. In this price range, performance can vary a lot, so look for devices with at least 8GB of RAM and processors that can deliver stutter-free visuals. It’s also important to consider support length: as periodic security updates and lengthy software support can extend the longevity of your device, which will save you money in the long run. Android phone FAQs What&#39;s the price difference for a cheap Android vs a cheap iPhone? iPhones tend to be more expensive compared to Android phones — even the cheapest iPhone, the iPhone SE, which starts from $429, is a harder pill to swallow compared to a cheap Android phone. In contrast, you can get your hands on a cheap Android device for as low as $100.

    "description": "YouTube Shorts has introduced a change that brings analytics for its bite-sized video option into closer parity with rival services TikTok and Instagram. The video platform will remove the minimum play time requirement it previously had for a user watching a clip to count as a view. Beginning March 31, a &quot;view&quot; will be added any time a YouTube Short is played or replayed. This will likely mean that creators will see higher view counts after the change takes place. YouTube will continue to track &quot;engaged views,&quot; which measure the number of times a clip was played &quot;for a certain number of seconds.&quot; YouTube clarified that the shift would not impact Creator earnings or their eligibility for the YouTube Partner Program; both will continue to be assessed by the engaged view metric. Both Instagram and TikTok have defined a &quot;view&quot; as the number of times a video starts playing, although those platforms also offer metrics for tracking time spent watching a piece of content. Considering YouTube Shorts , Instagram and TikTok have each claimed upwards of a billion monthly users, it makes sense that they count views similarly so that creators can better assess how many of those people they are reaching across the services.

    "description": "Utah Governor Spencer Cox has signed the App Store Accountability Act into law, making it the first state to require that app store makers verify their users&#39; ages. Under this law , people in Utah will need to be over age 18 to make a new account with an app store; underage users will either need to link their account to a parent&#39;s so that the adult can give permission for the child to use certain apps. The legislation is intended to protect children and teens, according to bill sponsor Todd Weiler, a Republican state senator. However, it has also raised questions about privacy and where the burden of responsibility falls to ensure that underage users don&#39;t see inappropriate content. Meta, Snap and X have supported the measure. &quot;We applaud Governor Cox and the State of Utah for being the first in the nation to empower parents and users with greater control over teen app downloads, and urge other states to consider this groundbreaking approach,&quot; the three companies said in a joint statement Wednesday. &quot;This approach spares users from repeatedly submitting personal information to countless individual apps and online services.&quot; Google, which runs the Play Store, had opposed the bill, and called on the governor to veto the measure. We&#39;ve reached out to Apple and Google for comment now that the bill has been signed into law. As it stands, the App Store Accountability Act is slated to take effect on May 7, but it seems likely that it will face legal challenges. Digital privacy groups have opposed the law and others like it, noting security concerns about how sensitive age verification data will be used or protected. Other state laws requiring online services to confirm users&#39; ages have also prompted lawsuits.

    "description": "Amazon&#39;s Big Spring Sale is much less focused on electronics than something like Prime Day or Black Friday, but it still includes a handful of tech deals worth calling out. If you’re looking to grab a new gadget on the cheap, we’ve rounded up the best of those that are available for less than $50. Some of the discounts have technically been available for a few days, but the offers still cover several devices we recommend in our various buying guides . As a reminder, Amazon says this latest sitewide sale will run through March 31, and you don&#39;t need to be a Prime member to access most of the deals.&nbsp; Best Amazon Spring Sale deals under $50 Anker PowerConf C200 for $48 ($12 off MSRP) : The PowerConf C200 is our favorite webcam for those on a tighter budget due to its crisp video quality, easy setup, solid microphones and built-in privacy cover. Its USB cable is on the shorter side, and it can’t match the overall accuracy of our top pick, but it’s still a clear upgrade over a built-in laptop camera for a much lower price. This is another deal we’ve seen numerous times in the last year, but it’s as low as the camera usually goes. Also at Anker . Anker 525 Charging Station for $30 ($36 off) : We recommend this reliable desktop charging station in our remote worker gift guide . It can’t provide the absolute fastest charge to your smartphone or laptop (topping out at a quick enough 67W), but it packs four USB ports — two USB-C, two USB-A — and three AC outlets in a frame that’s small enough to fit on a crowded desk. This deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . The Anker 525 Charging Station. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anker Nano Charger 30W for $13 ($10 off) : It’s hard to have too many portable wall chargers on standby. This one from Anker should be particularly useful for traveling: At just over an inch thick, it’s small enough to fit in a pocket, while its 30W USB-C port is enough to top up recent iPhones at full speed. (That’s not enough for some newer Android phones , though.) This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . Amazon Music Unlimited 3-month trial for free ($24 off) : Amazon is offering new subscribers three months of its Music Unlimited streaming service for free. Normally, it gives new users a one-month trial. Though Music Unlimited isn’t a top pick in our guide to the best music services , it still gets you lossless streaming quality and an extensive library of both music and podcasts. You could do worse if you just want to bum a few months of music streaming for no cost. Just note that your subscription will auto-renew once the trial period ends until you cancel. The Blink Mini 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Blink Mini 2 for $20 ($20 off) : This deal ties the lowest price to date for the Blink Mini 2, which is the budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras . This one comes with its share of trade-offs for the low price — its image quality isn’t the best, it locks certain features behind a paywall and it won’t automatically arm when you leave the house — but it still provides functional 1080p video, color night vision, motion alerts and Alexa support in a weather-resistant frame. It’s fairly simple to set up, too, though you’ll need to buy an external module if you want to store clips locally. Also at Best Buy , Lowe&#39;s and The Home Depot . Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Unlike the AirTag, it can also attach directly to a keychain. It probably isn’t the safest choice for long-distance travel, but it’s a convenient security blanket if you, say, leave your keys or wallet behind at a restaurant. This is another discount that’s been available for a few weeks, but it’s just 10 cents more the best price we’ve seen.

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals: Save up to $200 on AirPods, iPads and more",

    "description": "Amazon&#39;s Big Spring Sale may be aimed at things like apparel and outdoor goods more than electronics, but we’ve cut through the noise and found a few actually decent tech deals anyway. If you’re specifically looking for a new Apple device, good news: Various AirPods, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and Beats speakers are at or near their lowest prices to date. Many of these discounts aren’t explicitly tied to the sale, but if you’re just trying to save a few bucks, that shouldn’t matter much. We’ve rounded up the best Spring Sale Apple deals we could find below. As a reminder: Amazon says the event will run through March 31, and you don&#39;t need to be a Prime member to access any of the offers below.&nbsp; Best Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $149 ($30 off MSRP) : This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple’s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn’t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a score of 86 in our review. This discount is $11 higher than the best price we’ve seen, but it’s about as low as the earbuds have fallen outside of that. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. Also at Best Buy . The Apple Watch Series 10. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off) : The top pick in our guide to the best smartwatches , the Series 10 is a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer profile and a marginally larger display compared to the previous Series 9. That said, it remains a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. It should be a welcome upgrade if you’re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch (think pre-Series 7) — just keep in mind a patent dispute has locked it out the blood oxygen detection features found on those older models. This $100 discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the non-cellular model with a 42mm case. Also at Best Buy and Walmart . Apple Mac mini (M4 Pro) for $1,199 ($200 off) : It&#39;s still not cheap, but here&#39;s the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for this higher-spec configuration of the latest Mac mini, which includes an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. This specific model is overkill for casual users, but it should be a decent buy for those with more professional needs who want a compact Mac but can’t spring for the top-end Mac Studio . We gave the Mac mini a score of 90 in our review last November, praising its performance, pint-sized design and port selection, though it can get noisy under load and it still lacks an SD card reader. Also at B&amp;H . The M4 Pro Mac mini. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget Apple iPad (A16) for $329 ($20 off) : The newest entry-level iPad only arrived three weeks ago, but Amazon is currently selling it for $20 less than Apple direct, which is a decent little savings if you planned on grabbing the tablet early anyway. This one is another small update, but it now comes with a faster A16 chip, more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for media consumption and lighter work, it&#39;s still a fine value. Also at B&amp;H and Best Buy . Apple iPad Air 11-inch (M3) for $549 ($50 off) : Much like the deal on the base iPad above, this isn’t a huge discount, but it’s a nice chance to save a few bucks compared to buying from Apple directly. The new iPad Air was released on the same day as the iPad (A16) and is a similarly minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still prefer the Air over the base model if you can swing it: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. The older M2-powered model is an even better value if you can find it on sale, but either way the Air is the iPad we recommend to most people. Also at B&amp;H , Best Buy and Walmart . The 13-inch iPad Air M3. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $738 ($61 off) : We gave the 13-inch iPad Air a review score of 89 earlier this month. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 128GB model. Also at Walmart . Apple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off) : The iPad Pro is more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being how expensive it all is. This deal on doesn’t truly lessen that — and it’s another deal we’ve seen multiple times in recent months — but it still ties the 13-inch model’s all-time low.

    "description": "The Amazon Big Spring Sale isn’t as huge as, say, the company’s (two) Prime Day sales, but there are still plenty of deals to be found — particularly on goods for your home. While Engadget doesn’t test sheets and pillows, we do put our review skills to work on kitchen tech . We’ve combed through Amazon&#39;s long lists of what&#39;s on sale and found a good number of deals on the cooking gear we recommend. So if you’re in the market for a discount on a sous vide machine , coffee kettle or an air fryer , this is a good list to check out. The best Amazon Spring Sale deals on air fryers, Instant Pots and more Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $140 ($40 off) : The powerful Juice Fountain impressed us with its extraction abilities. Plus it’s relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This price isn’t as low as the $110 Amazon sold it for back in January, but this is the lowest price we’ve tracked since then. Anova Culinary Sous Vide Precision Cooker Nano for $100 ($50 off) : This is the machine that led our editor to dub these machines the “Millennial crockpot.” She uses this one a few times a week to make unfussy meals that keep her alive. The Nano model is a slightly smaller and less expensive version of the top pick in our buyer’s guide. This is about $10 more than the all-time low, but is the cheapest we’ve seen Amazon sell it for over the past couple of months. Cosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off) : Cosori’s fryer earned a spot as the runner up for best overall air fryer in our guide. It has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity. We like that it doesn’t take up too much space, but can still cook up a decent amount of food Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off) : If you want a more traditional toaster oven design with a huge capacity, go for our premium air fryer pick. The fryer-and-oven combo can accommodate a five-quart dutch oven, so it’s almost an auxiliary oven, which could come in handy when you’re cooking for a crowd. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it went for $300 at the end of last year. Breville the Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off) : This is the non-Pro version of the Breville air fryer we recommend . It has a slightly smaller capacity (0.8 cubic feet instead of one cubic foot) and is missing two cooking functions (dehydrate and proof). But if you’re not making your own jerky or baking a ton of bread, this one can toast, broil, air fry and slow cook. You can even get it in cool colors like Red Velvet Cake for the same price. Ninja DZ401 Foodi 10-quart air fryer for $190 ($40 off) : If you need to air fry two different foods at once, go for our recommendation for a dual-zone air fryer. It’s a beast, so we think it’s best for larger kitchens and people who make big meals. It went as low as $130 for Black Friday last year, but this is the cheapest price we’ve seen since then. Instant Vortex 2QT Mini Air Fryer for $50 ($10 off) : The budget pick in our guide doesn’t go on sale often — it’s already pretty cheap at its $60 list price. It’s sold for as little as $48 for Prime Day in July, but this is the cheapest we’ve seen since then. Its two-quart capacity is probably best for small kitchens and can crisp up food for one or two people. Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $90 $40 off) : We like this Instant Pot model because it&#39;s simple to use and has several quick-cooking modes including beans, cake, sous vide and more. It went as low as $70 earlier this year, but this is still a 30 percent discount off the list price. Instant Pot Pro Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $138 ($61 off) : We also suggest this fancier Pro Plus model in our guide to kitchen tech . It’s a Wi-Fi connected unit with a canning function and you can even release the steam remotely using the companion app — which has over 800 recipes. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it was $125 earlier this week and dipped as low as $99 for Black Friday last year.&nbsp; Ninja AF150AMZ Air Fryer for $120 (25 percent off) : This went as low as $100 for the holidays last year, but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen since then. The fryer gets an honorable mention in our air fryer guide because it makes good use of limited counter space with its taller design. The round cooking basket doesn’t feel as roomy as square ones but it does have a dehydrate option that other cookers don’t come with. Anova Culinary Sous Vide 3.0 for $129 ($70 off) : We named this the best overall sous vide machine after testing a number of models for our buyer’s guide. This is about $30 more than the low it hit for the holidays last year, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. We appreciate the easy digital controls and found that the high flow rate maintains water temperature better than other machines. Plus, if you’re at a loss for what to cook, you can check out the companion app which is replete with recipes. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $165 ($30 off) : This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. This is the pro model of the version we recommend in our tea guide . KitchenAid Artisan 5-quart stand mixer for $380 ($80 off) : Small wonder that the home cook’s gold standard of mixers made its way onto our kitchen tech guide . Its ton of available attachments can be used to make pasta, grind food, strain or spiralize fruits and veggies and more. This is no unitasker. This is a solid $80 discount off of the MSRP, but we’ll note that Amazon sold it for as low as $330 at the end of last year and for $350 last month. KitchenAid Go Cordless Hand Blender for $100 ($30 off) : The big selling point here is the removable battery that you can use for other KitchenAid Go appliances. In our testing, it had enough power to turn a roasted butternut squash into a smooth, creamy soup. The blender has hit this price a few times over the past few months and the deal isn’t as good as the $77 it sold for at the end of last year.

    "description": "This year’s Amazon Spring Sale is in full swing, and as promised, a ton of household, fashion and outdoor gear has dropped to record-low prices. Tech isn’t a huge focus for this sale, but there are a decent number of devices on sale right now for some of the best prices we’ve seen all year. The selection may not be as good as that of Amazon Prime Day in July, but it still provides a good opportunity to save on things like headphones, robot vacuums, air purifiers and more. We’ve collected the best Amazon Spring Sale deals on tech gear here so you don’t have to go searching for them. The Spring Sale runs through March 31, so check back here for all of the latest deals as they drop. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals 10th-gen iPad for $269 (23 percent off): The previous version of most affordable iPad gives you an A14 Bionic chip, a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, TouchID built into the lock button and more. It’s compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the keyboard folio, plus we found it to have solid performance and a matching battery life. Dyson AM09 heater and fan for $300 (36 percent off): The AM09 has been around for ages, and for good reason. It&#39;s an excellent heater during cold months and fan during warm months, so you can use it all year round. Jet Focus control lets you choose from Focused or Diffused for personal or whole-room heating or cooling, and the handy sleep timer lets you set when the device turns off in intervals from 15 minutes up to nine hours. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off): This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off): A version of one of our favorite air fryers , this air fryer toaster oven has 11 cooking modes including air fry, broil, bake, roast and more, and it has a large capacity that can fit up to six slices of bread at once or a 13-inch pizza. The Pro model is also on sale, down to $320 from $400. Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $318 (20 percent off): These top our list of the best wireless headphones you can get right now thanks to their supreme comfort, excellent sound quality and ANC, multipoint connectivity and 30-hour battery life. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. A quick-charge feature will net you 2.5 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging, so you&#39;ll rarely have to go without them, too. Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones for $349 ($80 off): These hold the top spot in our best wireless headphones guide for excellent noise cancellation. These cans will give you a step up in ANC, blocking out most noise and chatter of those around you. General audio quality has been improved as well, and they have a comfy fit. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $20 (43 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget streaming device can play content at 1080p/60fps and now its remote can also control your TV&#39;s power and volume. There&#39;s also Alexa support built into the remote, so you can use voice commands to search for content. Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $169 ($80 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you&#39;re on the market for a new desktop, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Beats Studio Pro for $180 (49 percent off): These Beats headphones have improved sound quality, good Transparency mode and USB-C charging, plus decent mic quality for phone calls. They support wired USB-C audio, plus they have solid ANC as well. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Blink Mini 2 for $20 (50 percent off): Blink&#39;s latest wired, indoor security camera is one of our favorites , particularly if you&#39;re just starting out building a security camera system. It&#39;s easy to set up and use, and it works seamlessly with Amazon&#39;s Alexa. Plus, if you want a local storage option, you can buy the Blink Sync Module 2 and a thumb drive to store video clips locally. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $300 ($138 off): This is a version of one of our top picks in our best robot vacuums guide. Shark makes excellent robovacs with strong suction power and convenient bagless, self-emptying bases. This model in particular can hold up to 60 days worth of debris before its base needs to be emptied. If you want a machine that can mop in addition to vacuum, consider Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac , which is 47 percent off and down to $400. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $149 (45 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 ($30 off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. Levoit Core 400S air purifier for $190 ($30 off with coupon): Our top pick for the best air purifier for most people, the Core 400S has easy-to-use onboard controls, powerful filtering technology that isn&#39;t too loud and relatively affordable replacement filters. It reliably improved air quality in our testing, and even though its mobile app is a little overstuffed, it gives you another way to control and monitor the device. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "description": "The big news in robot vacuums right now is iRobot’s announcement that it’s not confident in its ability to continue operating. That’s surprising considering the Roomba’s dominance in the automated floor-bot market. The company also makes up more than a few top picks in our budget and standard robo vac buying guides . Fortunately, a number of other brands make great vacs, too — and Roombas are still available. Thanks to Amazon’s Big Spring Sale this week, a number of robot vacuums are seeing decent discounts right now. We also found deals on a few of our recommended cordless stick vacs, for those who prefer to tackle their floors manually. The best Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac for $400 ($350 off) : In our testing, we’ve been consistently impressed with Shark vacuums — but they’re not cheap. This machine can mop in addition to vacuum and is nearly half price at 47 percent off. Shark Robot PowerDetect NeverTouch vac and mop combo for $500 ($400 off) : This is the non-pro model of our runner up pick for the best combo bot. It mops and vacuums, quickly making a map of your home on its first run. The app easily lets you program where your hard and carpeted surfaces are, as well as set schedules. The base empties the dry debris and dirty water, then refills it with new water. The difference between this model and the Pro version is that this one doesn’t clean the mop with each use, so you may need to manually perform that task more often — but the price difference may make up for that lack. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off) : This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX for $140 (44 percent off) : The “S” in the model name stands for “slim” and it was one of the more low-profile machines we tried. It’s a pick in our guide to budget robot vacuums and has a long battery life and good suction power for its price. The main drawback is the lack of Wi-Fi, so instead of programming it with your phone, you’ll use the included remote. The best cordless vacuum deals Tineco Pure ONE Station 5 for $349 ($110 off) : This vac earned an honorable mention in our tests. The self-emptying base is a big selling point. We also liked the auto-adjusting suction and single-button start feature. The fact that it doesn’t require proprietary bags helps keep down the long-term cost, too. &nbsp; Tineco Pure ONE S11 cordless vacuum for $200 ($100 off with coupon) : Click the coupon to get $95 off our top pick for a budget stick vac. We like that it automatically adjusts suction depending on what it&#39;s picking up and is relatively lightweight when you’re pushing it around your floors. The bin is on the small side and the battery life isn’t as good as on other models, but it’s an easy-to-use, no-frills way to clean floors. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off) : This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Tineco Pure ONE Station FurFree for $400 ($300 off) : Of all the stick vacs our reviewer tried for our guide , this is the one she wanted to use the most. It’s super convenient with a dock that charges and empties and cleans all parts of the machine — brush, tube and dustbin — after each use. Plus the suction power is great and the iLoop smart sensor kicks up the suction when needed.

    "description": "Codemasters&#39; Formula 1 franchise is back for another lap. Publisher EA says the tracks in F1 2025 have a more realistic look and feel, thanks to LiDAR scanning. The new installment arrives on May 30. Although EA didn&#39;t offer much detail about LiDAR&#39;s use, we can safely assume it involved high-resolution 3D scans of real-world tracks to make them as close to a 1:1 representation as possible. (After all, it&#39;s the same tech autonomous vehicles use for real-time 3D mapping and object detection.) Regardless, we reached out to EA to try to get more info. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back. EA / Codemasters In other areas, F1 25 overhauls My Team, with players now able to serve as the squad&#39;s owner and driver. And in the Braking Point story mode, Konnersport has moved up in the world and is now a highly competitive team battling for championships. But wait, &quot;a dramatic event throws the team into chaos,&quot; so rest assured the writing team still understands the importance of using obstacles in storytelling. F1 25 launches on PS5 , Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 30. If you own F1 23 or F1 24 , you can save 15 percent off your pre-order of the game&#39;s Iconic Edition, which typically costs $80 on PC and $90 on consoles. That variant will add post-launch Braking Point chapters that tie into Apple&#39;s upcoming film F1 , starring Brad Pitt. Meanwhile, the base game costs $60 on PC and $70 on PlayStation and Xbox. You can check out the trailer below, featuring cover star Lewis Hamilton.

    "description": "Samsung just released a spate of new QLED TVs, after teasing the lineup at CES . The Neo QLED line is the first to feature the company’s Vision AI platform. This allows for new personalization and optimization features. You can pick one up right now, but you might want to open up a line of credit first. The most budget-friendly model is the 55-inch Class Neo QLED 4K QN80F, which comes in at $1,300. As for 4K models, prices balloon all the way up to $15,000 for the top-of-the-line 98-inch Class Neo QLED 4K QN90F. Samsung also just released some 8K smart TVs with Vision AI. The pricing here starts at $3,300 for a 65-inch model and goes up to $5,300 for the 85-inch version.&nbsp; If you need a high-end soundbar to go with that brand new TV, Samsung has got you covered. The company just announced availability for two new soundbar systems. The flagship HW-Q990F costs $1,800 and the HW-Q800F clocks in at $1,000. Both come with the company’s redesigned subwoofer, but the Q990F also includes a pair of rear speakers. Samsung They support wireless Dolby Atmos technology, so the cable clutter can go the way of the dodo. All of these products are available right now from Samsung or via third-party retailers.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/the-latest-kindle-update-lets-you-turn-pages-by-double-tapping-175452454.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon has updated Kindles with a new way to navigate books. While nothing will recapture the tactile pleasure of physical page turn buttons, anyone with a Kindle running Version 5.18.1 of Amazon&#39;s software will now be able to double-tap the side or back of their e-reader to turn pages. &quot;Double Tap to Page Turn&quot; can be turned on in the Settings menu under Device Options. Amazon says it works for more than just turning pages. You can also use double taps to scroll through your Home and Library pages, too. Interestingly, the option doesn&#39;t use the touchscreen at all. Good E-Reader speculates Amazon is relying on the accelerometer inside Kindles to detect taps. Along with the update, Amazon is also adding a feature it calls &quot;Recaps for Books in Series.&quot; These are short summaries &quot;for thousands of bestselling English language Kindle books in series you have purchased or borrowed.&quot; The company already does things like automatically group books from the same series to make them easier to find, but this should save you the trouble of looking up a summary of A Dance with Dragons before diving into The Winds of Winter — assuming it&#39;s ever released. The 5.18.1 update is rolling out now newer Kindles, like the Kindle Colorsoft , and devices as old as the 10th generation Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite. It will also be available on the last of Amazon&#39;s e-readers to have physical buttons, the Kindle Oasis . If you don&#39;t see it on your device now, you can manually download the update from Amazon&#39;s website and install it yourself.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apps/waze-is-officially-stopping-support-for-google-assistant-on-iphones-173545610.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The navigation app Waze is dropping Google Assistant support for iPhones , citing &quot;ongoing difficulties&quot; with integrating the service. The company says it plans on replacing it with an &quot;enhanced voice integration solution&quot; at some point in the future. Google Assistant will still work for Android users. This is happening a full year after iPhone users began reporting issues related to Google Assistant, with many people noting that voice commands were totally broken. Waze says that it has &quot;not been working as intended for over a year&quot; and that it would rather &quot;phase out Google Assistant on iOS&quot; instead of &quot;patching a feature that has faced ongoing difficulties.&quot; As previously stated, Google Assistant for Waze will continue to work on Android phones. However, there’s a valid question to be asked about how long Android users will continue to be able to issue voice commands in the app via the digital assistant. Google has pledged to transition users away from Google Assistant to Gemini. As a matter of fact, the company said that &quot;the classic Google Assistant will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices&quot; as the year winds on. It’ll also no longer be available for downloads on app stores starting later this year.

    "title": "Canon goes all in on vlogging with the PowerShot V1 compact and R50 V mirrorless cameras",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-goes-all-in-on-vlogging-with-the-powershot-v1-compact-and-r50-v-mirrorless-cameras-170047522.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Canon is expanding its vlogging lineup in a big way with two new models, the R50 V mirrorless and PowerShot V1 compact, both designed to take on cameras in Sony&#39;s vlogging lineup. The PowerShot V1 has an interesting new 1.4-inch sensor that&#39;s considerably larger than the ones on most compact cameras. The R50 V, meanwhile, matches features from Sony&#39;s ZV-E10 II but at a considerably lower price.&nbsp; PowerShot V1 compact camera The PowerShot V1 was already announced and released in Japan, but it&#39;s now set to come to North America. It effectively competes with Sony&#39;s ZV-1 II 1-inch sensor compact but has a much larger 1.4-inch 22.3MP sensor that&#39;s roughly the same size as Micro Four Thirds, but with a horizontal aspect ratio better suited for video. That larger size, along with the 17-52mm (3.1x zoom) f/2.8-4.5 lens, should make it superior to its rival in low light while also offering shallower depth of field. I&#39;ve only had the PowerShot V1 for a day, but it&#39;s heavy for a compact camera at 426 grams (15 ounces) and fairly thick. There aren&#39;t many manual controls other than the top mode dial, a rear setting dial for burst, exposure compensation and other functions, a lens dial for aperture, a camera/video switch and a zoom dial, along with several buttons. It has a 3-inch, one-million-dot fully articulating rear display but no electronic viewfinder, just like the ZV-1 II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Dent for Engadget It can shoot 4K 30 fps supersampled video using the full sensor width, 4K 60p video with a 1.4 times crop or 1080p at 240 fps. Also supported is Canon C-Log3 with 10-bit 4:2:2 capture to improve dynamic range and allow for easier grading. Optical along with digital enhanced stabilization are available and to allay overheating it comes with a built-in cooling fan that allows unlimited shooting times at all resolutions. Like the ZV-1 II, the PowerShot V1 supports several shooting modes aimed at creators. Those include a &quot;close-up demo mode&quot; that&#39;s equivalent to Sony&#39;s &quot;product showcase,&quot; allowing the camera to quickly focus on an object you hold in front of the camera. Another is &quot;smooth skin mode&quot; for beauty-style shooting, plus &quot;movie IS mode&quot; for vloggers that stabilizes any jolting movements like walking.&nbsp; Steve Dent for Engadget The PowerShot V1 uses Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel II autofocus system with subject detection and face/eye tracking and includes a &quot;subject tracking IS&quot; mode that automatically adjusts cropping to center the subject in the frame. You can use it as a 1080p webcam via the USB-C port, while connecting to your smartphone for live streaming. For photography, it sports a physical mechanical shutter and can shoot bursts at up to 30 fps with autofocus in electronic shutter mode. A welcome feature is a built-in ND filter (equivalent to three stops of light reduction) that will allow creators to add more bokeh on sunny days.&nbsp; Other features include support for a smallish LP-E17 battery and a single UHS-II card slot along with microphone, headphone and microHDMI connectors. However, the PowerShot V1 isn&#39;t cheap at $900. It&#39;s set to arrive in April 2025.&nbsp; EOS R50 V Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V is Canon&#39;s first true mirrorless vlogging-specific camera and is clearly designed to go up against Sony&#39;s ZV-E10 II. It&#39;s slightly taller than the PowerShot V1 but has largely the same dimensions otherwise, and weighs just a bit more if you include the new 14-30mm (21-45mm full-frame equivalent) f/4-6.3 power zoom lens.&nbsp; It has a nice array of manual controls including a primary control dial on top, a zoom rocker for supported lenses and an unusual mode dial that lets you select multiple custom video and vlogging modes including Movie Auto Slow Shutter, Slow/Fast Motion Recording and Movie IS Mode. For vloggers it has a fully-articulating 3-inch display but again, no electronic viewfinder. Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V comes with a 24MP APS-C sensor like the EOS R50 , while also including features from Canon&#39;s Cinema EOS system like C-Log3 capture and 10-bit 4:2:2 video. It can capture supersampled 4K 30 fps video using the full sensor width, 4K 60p video with a crop or 120 fps 1080p video. It&#39;s not a bad camera for photographers either, letting them shoot 12 fps bursts using the first-curtain shutter or 15 fps with the electronic shutter, all with continuous autofocus enabled.&nbsp; Like the ZV-E10 II it lacks in-body stabilization but does offer optical stabilization with supported lenses, along with electronic stabilization. For situations that require extra shake reduction, the optical and electronic stabilization modes can be combined and there&#39;s an enhanced IS mode for abrupt movements like walking. Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V has vlogging-friendly modes like a product showcase-type function along with focus breathing correction. You get Canon&#39;s latest Dual Pixel II autofocus system that includes face and eye detection as well as subject tracking for people, animals and vehicles (along with an auto mode). A dedicated button allows you to livestream instantly with four modes supported: UVC/UAC, HDMI, Camera Connect, and Live Switcher Mobile multi-camera. It comes with a single UHS-II card slot and an LP-E17 battery, along with microphone, headphone, microHDMI and USB-C ports. The R50 V will cost $650 for the body only or $850 with the new RF-S14-30mm F4-6.3 IS STM PZ lens (sold separately for $330). Canon also announced the $1,700 RF 20mm f/1.4L VCM full-frame lens, the latest in its fast hybrid cinema-friendly series that includes the RF24mm f/1.4, RF 35mm f/1.4 and RF 50mm f/1.4 models. As mentioned, I&#39;ve only had the R50 V and PowerShot V1 cameras for a short time but you can expect a full review of both models shortly.

    "description": "The Kindle Colorsoft e-reader is on sale for $225 as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . That’s a discount of 20 percent, as the typical price hovers at $280. This deal also comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited, which is a good way to rack up some quick reads. We loved the Colorsoft in our official review , calling it the &quot;missing link in Amazon’s e-reader lineup.&quot; The reason is right in the name. This is the only Kindle with a color screen. The company led the e-reader space for 17 years before releasing a model that could display color. Amazon says it took so long because the technology just wasn’t good enough to implement until recently. The end result? The colors do really pop. This is a great choice for those who primarily read full-color materials like comics and graphic novels. There’s a pinch-to-zoom feature to get closer to details and an auto-adjusting front light. Just like most modern Kindles, the pages turn fast and the lag is minimal. It’s also waterproof, for reading poolside or in the bathtub. This model doesn’t include lock screen ads by default, which is nice. The primary downside here is the cost. It’s hard to recommend any e-reader for $280, even if it displays color. This is a premium product, however, so it’s easy to recommend it at $225.

    "description": "Indie publishers and developers are once again teaming up to show off the fruits of their labor in a gaming showcase from The Triple-i Initiative. The second edition will take place on April 10 (the same date as last year&#39;s show) at noon ET. The first showcase included the announcements of The Rogue Prince of Persia and Slay the Spire 2 , along with expansion reveals for Brotato and Vampire Survivors . Major updates for Palworld , Risk of Rain 2 and V Rising were unveiled as well. This time around, you can expect 45 minutes of world premieres, gameplay reveals, release dates, demo drops and more from 30-plus games. V Rising will be on show again this year, alongside the likes of Enshrouded and Deep Rock Galactic . The showcase trailer includes a peek at Sifu developer Sloclap &#39;s intriguing 5v5 arcade soccer game, Rematch , so it looks like we&#39;ll get an update on that one. Vampire Survivors studio Poncle is also among the list of developers with something to reveal. Not only that, Playstack, the publisher of a little game called Balatro , has something up its sleeve. &quot;We had been saving our big announcement for a special showcase,&quot; Marta Matyjewicz, marketing manager at Playstack, said in a statement. &quot;We were amazed by the quality of last year’s Triple-i, so when the opportunity came to be a part of it, we knew we had to take it. It’s truly an honor to showcase our game alongside so many awesome titles.&quot; Insert three side eyes emoji here. You&#39;ll be able to watch the showcase on several platforms, including YouTube, Twitch, Bilibili and Steam. After the main event, there will be a post-show including deep dives on some of the games. A week-long sale featuring games from both editions of Triple-i Initiative will go live on Steam, Epic Games Store, Humble and elsewhere on the same day as the showcase.

    "description": "Anker devices make up some of our top picks for the best power banks on the market , and the company debuted a few new ones at CES this year. Those included Anker&#39;s Laptop Power Bank , a 25,000mAh portable charger with three 100W USB-C ports and a single USB connector. That new device is down to the best price we&#39;ve seen since launch as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale — just $88, which represents a 20-percent discount from its original price. The new power bank , available in Black and Silver, comes with two USB-C cables and can charge four devices simultaneously. It works with laptops, smartphones, cameras, gaming consoles and more. For example, it can charge an MacBook Air with an M3 chip to 50 percent in 33 minutes. It can also get an iPhone 16 to the same level in just 25 minutes. Plus, its display shows the battery&#39;s health and temperature, along with output and input wattage.&nbsp; Anker&#39;s 140W four-port wall charger is also discounted for Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale. You can pick it up right now for $77, down from $90. It offers a display that tracks power usage for each port, fast-charge status and temperature. Plus, it has something Anker refers to as an &quot; odometer ,&quot; tracking lifetime usage hour by hour.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ankers-latest-chargers-and-power-banks-are-up-to-20-percent-off-in-the-amazon-spring-sale-130131799.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Levoit LVAC-200 cordless vacuum has been discounted to $150 as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . That’s 25 percent off and close to a record-low price. The sale only applies to the standard white model and not the blue one. The LVAC-200 made our list of the best cordless vacuums . We loved the lightweight design. It only weighs three pounds and it can easily be disassembled for storage. Just pop the cleaning head from the extension arm and the arm from the motor base. It also features a locking mechanism, so it can stand upright between cleaning sessions. The cleaning power here is more than sufficient. We found that it did a good job with &quot;all kinds of dry messes.&quot; It has three suction modes, so it can handle both hard and carpeted floors. It can even suck up pet hair, which is the true test of any vacuum. The design allows for the vacuum to easily reach underneath couches and beds, which is a fantastic bonus. On the downside, the dustbin is pretty small, at just 0.75 liters. We found during our testing that the bin could fill up with just one full cleaning session. The vacuum also includes a five-stage filtration system, but it doesn’t include a true HEPA filter.

    "description": "GeoGuessr, the geography game that tasks players with guessing a location in the world based on a random Google Street View image, is coming to Steam . It’s slated to hit early access on the platform sometime in April. That should hopefully make the game much easier to access on Steam Deck without having to fiddle with browser settings on desktop mode. The developers are taking the early access approach on Steam so they can &quot;refine the gameplay, introduce new features and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players&quot; with the aim of making &quot;the ultimate competitive and casual geography game.&quot; The early access version on Steam will at the very least have a competitive solo mode and casual Team Duels, though there are plans to add more modes and competitive features in the coming months. GeoGuessr has a fairly thriving competitive scene — this year&#39;s world championship has a $100,000 prize pool — so you could stand to cash in if you become great at the game. But be warned: if you think pro GeoGuessr might be your calling, you&#39;ll be up against some incredibly skilled players. They can pinpoint parts of the world based on corn growing at the side of a road , clouds in the sky and room decor . GeoGuessr pros are absolutely absurd. It&#39;s not clear how much the full Steam version will cost. A free version will include unlimited access to the amateur division, which is GeoGuessr&#39;s lowest rank, as well as unranked Team Duels. A Steam Pass that&#39;s available to purchase inside the game will be required to access the full Solo Duels mode. The store page notes that the price won&#39;t change during the time the game is in early access (a period that&#39;s expected to be at least six months). Nor do the developers expect to increase the price when the game exits early access. The original, 12-year-old web version allows players to make three free daily guesses, but to play more you have to pay for a subscription, which starts at $2.50 per month. Unlimited access on the mobile apps is available on the $3 per month Pro Unlimited plan. While there will be cross-play between Steam and the browser/mobile versions, the current GeoGuessr plans don&#39;t include full access to the Steam edition.

Not only is that a $15 discount, but its only a couple of dollars more than the record-low price we&#39;ve tracked. Amazon released the Fire TV Stick HD last October and, soon after, it became the top budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices . It&#39;s a basic stre2amer that received a couple of much-needed updates when Amazon revamped its Fire TV devices last year. The Fire TV Stick HD has HDR support and streams with full HD resolution. It also comes with an Alexa-powered remote control, which lets you search for titles with just a click of the Alexa button. That remote also has Netflix and Prime Video buttons, but the device can run most streaming apps, like Disney+ and Peacock.&nbsp; Elsewhere in the Fire TV lineup, you can grab the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for only $40 thanks to Amazon Spring Sale deals. This is the most powerful streaming dongle Amazon makes, with support for 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos, Wi-Fi 6E and Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass gaming.

    "description": "It turns out Nintendo Directs are like buses. You wait ages for one then get two in quick succession. Days before Nintendo fully spills the beans on the Switch 2 during a dedicated showcase on April 2 , the company is hosting a surprise Direct on March 27 at 10AM ET. You can watch it above. The stream will run for around 30 minutes and focus on upcoming Switch games. There won&#39;t be any Switch 2 info, but pretty much every game you see here will run on the new console anyway, thanks to backwards compatibility . Since this isn&#39;t billed as an Indie World Direct (those focus on indie games), it&#39;s not really clear what we can expect from this one. Nintendo&#39;s developers will largely be focused on making Switch 2 games at this point. Still, the Switch has a massive install base — the company has sold more than 150 million of those consoles — so Nintendo probably won&#39;t want to leave all those players behind any time soon.&nbsp; To that end, we can expect a stream of games for the original Switch to keep coming for the foreseeable future. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond , for instance, is still slated to hit the Switch sometime this year . Third-party games will still be coming to the Switch as well, including a certain one from Team Cherry that we expect to show up in every single gaming showcase but won&#39;t mention here because we don&#39;t want to jinx it.

Right now, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 earbuds are down to $45 from $80 — a 44 percent discount. That&#39;s an incredible price for earbuds with active noise cancellation.&nbsp; The $45 deal on our favorite budget wireless earbuds is available for the Black and Blue models, while the White, Green and Purple options are slightly more expensive at $50. However, the latter two typically retail for $100 , so they&#39;re actually half off with the current sale.&nbsp; As mentioned above, one of the great things about Anker&#39;s Soundcore Space A40 earbuds is that they offer ANC. Anker claims that using it can reduce potential noise by 98 percent. The earbuds also hold up to 10 hours of battery and up to 50 hours with the charging case. Plus, you can get up to four hours of extra juice with just 10 minutes in the case.

    "description": "The once-iconic music-sharing platform Napster was just purchased for $207 million, with a company called Infinite Reality picking up the tab. What could Napster offer in 2025 to warrant such a price tag? Infinite Reality says it&#39;ll be used as a &quot;social music platform that prioritizes active fan engagement&quot; with a focus on giving artists a platform they can use to connect with listeners and, of course, make more money from them. More specifically, the company plans on creating virtual 3D spaces for music fans to attend concerts and listening parties, in addition to creating a sales platform for musicians and labels to sell merch. This isn’t the worst idea in the world, as attending these kinds of shared events is probably my favorite aspect of VR. It&#39;s not clear what will happen with the existing Napster service; for now, it doesn&#39;t appear it&#39;ll go away immediately. While it offers a similarly massive catalog to what you&#39;ll find on industry leaders Spotify and Apple Music as well as others, the service isn&#39;t really top-of-mind anymore.&nbsp; &quot;The most legendary collab?! Infinite Reality has acquired iconic online music brand @Napster . With this acquisition, we&#39;re expanding and reimagining Napster, empowering artists with new audience monetization and engagement capabilities, underpinned by iR’s #immersive … pic.twitter.com/L4Fig7QFct — Infinite Reality (@Infinite_iR) March 25, 2025 “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” Acunto said. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.” Napster holds numerous licenses to stream millions of songs, which is what made it an attractive prospect to Infinite Reality. The company says its version of Napster will “disrupt legally.” Current Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos says that the purchase will allow artists to create “crazy environments that are really only limited by their imaginations.” As an example, he described a reggae artist who might enjoy a virtual beach environment. Acunto adds that it’ll be like “Clubhouse times a trillion.” He’s referring to the virtual events app that became popular during COVID , but eventually petered out. Infinite Reality has been on a buying spree the last couple of years. In addition to Napster, it purchased the Drone Racing League , the metaverse marketing platform Landvault and the VR shopping platform Obsess . As for Napster, it started in 1999 and took the world by storm, creating an easy-peasy way to steal music. It only took a couple of years for mounting legal battles to catch up to the platform and it declared bankruptcy in 2001. However, that was just the beginning . The software company Roxio purchased the platform in 2002 and relaunched it as a legitimate e-commerce venture that sold digital music files. In 2008, Best Buy came calling and scooped it up. The retail giant only held on to Napster for a few years before selling to Rhapsody in 2011 . Rhapsody tried to make Napster a household name in Europe for the next decade before a consortium of blockchain companies, led by Hivemind and Algorand, bought it in 2022 . These companies had plans to do some kind of NFT-based nonsense, because “music x web3 is one of the most exciting spaces.” That didn’t work and, well, here we are. Here’s to another 25 years of being passed around like a hot potato. Update, March 26 2025, 10:43AM ET: This story was updated with more details about Infinite Reality&#39;s plans for Napster.

    "description": "As someone who paid full price for Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM5 headphones , I am jealous to report that they are 20 percent off right now as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . Yes, our choice for 2025&#39;s best wireless headphones have dropped to $318 from $400 — a 20 percent discount. They briefly dropped to $250 earlier in the sale, but have since jumped back up a bit. Nevertheless, this is a good sale price overall; you can grab them on discount in either the silver of smoky pink colors. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones are one of them. I&#39;ve raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they&#39;re so comfortable. I&#39;ve worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp; Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they&#39;re a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don&#39;t have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp; Their excellence on flights isn&#39;t the only reason we gave Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones a 95 in our review . They&#39;re also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound&#39;s quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don&#39;t fold up, but especially at this price, they&#39;re still such a great buy.&nbsp; This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don&#39;t quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

    "description": "Microsoft has launched two new &quot;reasoning agents&quot; for Copilot that were designed to analyze vast amounts of work data, including emails, meetings, chats and documents. The first tool called &quot;Researcher&quot; is based on OpenAI&#39;s deep research model combined with Copilot&#39;s advanced orchestration and deep search capabilities. Researcher was made for &quot;complex, multi-step research&quot; at work. It can take a user&#39;s internal work data along with additional information from the web, such as competitive data, emerging trends and the latest market analysis, to create market strategies and comprehensive quarterly reports, among other potential uses. Plus, it can pull data from Salesforce, ServiceNow and other external sources. Meanwhile, the new &quot;Analyst&quot; tool was built to function like a skilled data scientist. It&#39;s based on OpenAI&#39;s o3-mini reasoning model and uses &quot;chain-of-thought reasoning&quot; to solve issues in multiple steps to provide answers that Microsoft says &quot;mirror human analytical thinking.&quot; It can process raw data across multiple spreadsheets to, say, predict future revenue and expenses, forecast demand for a new product and visualize the purchasing patterns of customers. For the most complex data queries, it can run Python, and users will be able to view the code while it&#39;s running in real time.&nbsp; Both Researcher and Analyst will be rolling out to customers with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license starting in April as part of &quot;Frontier.&quot; Customers enrolled to the new Frontier program will get access to Copilot technologies while they&#39;re still in development, starting with these two new tools.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-deep-research-and-analysis-tools-for-copilot-143001894.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Noble Audio FoKus Apollo review: The high price of pristine audio",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html?src=rss",
    "description": "I don’t review a lot of $650 headphones . That’s because most audio companies sell their top-of-the-line gear around $300-$400. Noble Audio isn’t like most companies. The FoKus Rex5 earbuds, for example, cram in five separate drivers where much of the competition uses two at the most. Noble was also among the first to employ xMEMS drivers in wireless earbuds in a bid to improve bass performance. Enter the FoKus Apollo , a $649 pair of active noise canceling (ANC) headphones with a detachable boom mic and up to 80 hours of battery life. The real star of the show is the driver setup , which Noble says is the first time this configuration appears in wireless headphones. The company is once again on a quest for the absolute best sound quality, but it may sacrifice a little too much along the way. Sound quality is the main attraction Noble Audio’s proposition is simple: the “world’s first” headphones that offer a hybrid speaker pairing of a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar magnetic driver. A dynamic driver is nothing new for a set of cans, but adding the latter makes the FoKus Apollo’s audio setup unique. For the uninitiated, planar magnetic drivers have a thin, flat diaphragm that typically offers a wider, more immersive soundstage and enhanced detail compared to dynamic drivers. Planar magnetic drivers are typically reserved for audiophile-grade headphones since they’re larger and more fragile. With the FoKus Apollo, Noble capitalized on the best of both worlds for the stock tuning. You get the bass power of a dynamic driver with the clarity of a planar magnetic driver. Since planar magnetic units can’t move enough air for the robust bass that most of us crave, and as dynamic drivers are limited with mid- and high-range details, the company argues it has created the optimal solution. From the first second of the first song, I could tell the FoKus Apollo was built differently. The addition of planar magnetic drivers offers the most bass-heavy genres an almost absurd amount of detail. Albums like Spiritbox’s Tsunami Sea that lack clarity on other headphones greatly benefit from the treble boost, serving up more nuance in the guitar riffs and texture in the kick drum blasts. The FoKus Apollo also excels with mellow styles, allowing you to hear every bit of sound coming from the acoustic guitars, banjo, bass and more on Julien Baker &amp; TORRES’ “Sugar in the Tank.” Going from most over-ear headphones to the FoKus Apollo is like going from standard music streaming to vinyl. And I don’t think that’s hyperbole. FoKus Apollo in-use: ANC, battery life and more Billy Steele for Engadget A pair of $649 ANC headphones better damn well provide some decent noise cancellation, even if you’re primarily buying them for the audio performance. Noble opted for a hybrid ANC setup with three microphones on each side and a Qualcomm QCC3084 chip. That processor provides the necessary digital signal processing (DSP) and algorithms to reduce background distractions. Like a lot of ANC headphones, the FoKus Apollo struggles with voices. That means any hopes of silencing a chatty colleague won’t pan out. However, the headphones do a solid job with constant noise sources — fans, appliances, noise machines, etc. — so they do offer some relief. The noise-blocking prowess isn’t as good as the likes of Bose , but I found ample room to focus during my test sessions. While the ANC here isn’t among the best, it’s perfectly serviceable in most environments. Noble promises a whopping 60 hours of battery life with ANC enabled, with another 20 hours of use if you turn it off. I found that those figures hold true during my time with the FoKus Apollo. After 30 hours of music, podcasts and work calls with noise cancellation active, the headphones still had 57 percent battery remaining — tracking slightly better than the company’s stated numbers. The Fokus Apollo comes with all the accessories you’d ever need right in the box. Noble includes a detachable boom mic, 3.5mm to 4.4mm adapter, two-prong airline adapter, USB-C cable and 3.5mm aux cable. The headphones can be used with either of those two cords, and the company recommends you do so when employing the microphone for optimal voice quality. If you’re planning to use the Fokus Apollo for calls, you can expect mixed results. In quiet spaces with little echo, you’ll sound good enough for a professional presentation. When you move to a room with some natural reverb, the mics on these headphones pick that up a little too well. What’s more, they’re not great at blocking background sounds, as fans, white noise machines and raucous appliances were all clearly heard on the other end during my tests. Design that matches the sound The FoKus Apollo is really expensive, so Noble couldn’t just give us a set of headphones built mostly out of plastic and call it a day. Thankfully, the company chose a mix of anodized aluminum, premium protein leather and a soft Alcantara headband. The leather-wrapped memory foam ear pads are replaceable, which will extend the life of the headphones under heavy use. There’s also a nice textured cloth pattern on the outside of the ear cups and headband that provide both tactile and visual contrast. Noble Audio provides physical controls on the FoKus Apollo, so you’ll never have to struggle with tap or touch gestures to make changes. On the right side, there’s a dedicated button for ANC modes (on, off and transparency) with a three-control array just below it. Here, the top and bottom buttons handle the volume and track adjustments while the center one is used for power, Bluetooth pairing, play/pause and to summon Google Assistant, Siri or some other virtual helper. On the left ear cup, a single slider allows you to mute all the microphones, even the boom when it’s attached, without reaching for your phone or keyboard. The lack of advanced features Billy Steele for Engadget The FoKus Apollo is really only focused on the basics, so it doesn’t offer any of today’s advanced features. Heck, there aren’t even tools that have been on other sets for years — like wear detection. Although you’ll get support for Sony’s LDAC codec along with AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC, there’s no mention of Dolby Atmos or any form of spatial audio. You don’t find any discussion of adaptive audio or adaptive ANC that makes automatic adjustments to both overall sound and noise cancellation either. Look, I’m well aware the premise here is pristine sound quality above all else. But at $649, which is $100 more than the AirPods Max by the way, I expect some degree of convenience that allows me to keep these headphones on for most of the day. Automatic pausing or wear detection should be standard at this price and it would be nice to have some additional sound/ANC options. I’m not picky about whether those are the automatic, adaptive type, or whether they’re settings I have to toggle on in the app. Just, please, give me something more than EQ adjustments when your sound out of the box is already incredible. The competition Once you hit $500 and above, you’ve surpassed what most companies charge for their flagship-level wireless headphones. You’re also in a price range where I’ve only reviewed a handful of models. If money is no object, the $699 Px8 from Bowers &amp; Wilkins delivers excellent sound quality in a design that might be preferable to some folks (there’s at least multiple color options). Its ANC performance isn’t earth shattering either, and one of my biggest gripes with the company’s products is the lack of advanced features like the FoKus Apollo. There’s also the AirPods Max and Dyson On-Trac , but neither of those are easy to recommend. Apple’s over-ear headphones have barely been updated since they arrived in 2020, except for an upgrade to USB-C and the upcoming addition of lossless audio . Dyson’s headphones have long battery life and a unique design, but they didn’t impress me sound-wise, have average ANC performance and lack the modern features I expect for $500. I also need to mention Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW75 in the over-$500 discussion. If you’re after high-end looks, no other company consistently nails its trademark aesthetic like M&amp;D. True to its lineage, the company pairs leather and metal on these headphones, along with tempered glass panels on the outside of the earcups. I’ve always enjoyed the balance of M&amp;D’s stock tuning and the ANC performance is solid. You won’t get any advanced features here either, but like the Px8, there are multiple color options if you’re after something other than Noble’s black and silver paint scheme. Wrap-up I have no doubts there are a lot of people that will thoroughly enjoy the FoKus Apollo . If you crave the absolute best sound quality on the market, these headphones are the best I’ve tested in that regard. For me, to pay $649 I expect more in terms of features. The first item would be better ANC performance, but I don’t feel like spatial audio support and wear detection are too much to ask. Even without any of that, you do get a novel driver setup that produces some ridiculously detailed sound across diverse genres.

    "description": "When it debuted in 2022, Apple’s 10th-generation iPad sat in something of a no-man’s land, bringing a long-overdue design revamp at an inflated price. A year and a half later, Apple gave the slate a $100 price cut and immediately turned it into a much more enticing value . Now, the company has quietly released a follow-up. Dubbed the iPad (A16) , the new tablet is a far less dramatic update, one with welcome performance improvements that otherwise refuses to rock the boat. It even lacks the Apple Intelligence features Apple has endlessly promoted over the past year. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Compared to the iPad Air, iPad Pro and iPad mini, this might be the easiest Apple tablet to grok — it’s the cheapest, it only comes in one size and it’s clearly designed for the core iPad Things. That doesn’t make it a slam dunk, though. What hasn’t changed Almost everything about the latest iPad is identical to the previous entry-level iPad from 2022, which brought many of the iPad Air’s features down to a lower price. The design is unchanged, with the same dimensions, weight, bezels, display and aluminum finish as before. Apple now lists the screen as being 11 inches instead of 10.9 inches, but it’s merely rounding up for marketing purposes — the size is no different. There are still competent 12-megapixel cameras on the front and back, with the selfie cam conveniently located along the device’s long edge for FaceTime calls. The same reliable Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the power button in lieu of Face ID. Two speakers, one on either end, sit behind a (misleading) quartet of grilles, while a lone USB-C port continues to max out at basic USB 2.0 transfer speeds. There’s no difference in accessory support either, and the whole thing is available in the same bold colors: blue, pink, yellow or silver. Battery life, meanwhile, still checks in at around 10 hours per charge, give or take a few depending on how you push it. I got 11 hours and 19 minutes out of the slate after playing a 1080p movie on loop at roughly 70 percent brightness and volume (and with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth disabled). Gaming and media editing will naturally sap it faster. Most of this is still perfectly fine for a $349 tablet. The last iPad was a light and comfortable slab, with a substantial aluminum finish and flat sides that made it feel modern. This one is no different. And iPadOS is still a level above Android and Windows tablets when it comes to app and game support, long-term updates and features optimized for large displays. But if the 10th-gen iPad was a “tick” update, the iPad (A16) is clearly a “tock.” That said, there are some important changes, namely a faster chip, more memory and higher storage options, plus a few minor tweaks like Smart HDR 4 processing for photos and support for Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.2. It’s a spec bump through and through, with most of those tweaks being for the better, although I do think that some of the things that haven’t been touched could really use an update next time. A faster chip and more RAM As the name implies, the latest iPad’s headline upgrade is its A16 chip. This is a slightly weaker version of the A16 Bionic found in 2022’s iPhone 14 Pro and the regular iPhone 15 from 2023. Compared to that SoC, this A16 has five CPU cores instead of six and four GPU cores instead of five. But in practice, it’s still more than fast enough for the vast majority of things people do with iPads: browsing the web, streaming video, reading ebooks, viewing and editing photos, playing most games and the like. I tested this iPad against my personal 13-inch iPad Air M2 for much of this review, and the two consistently booted up and loaded popular apps at virtually the same speed. The few times the Air M2 was quicker, the difference wasn’t long enough to be significant. Geekbench 6 results back this up: The iPad (A16) earned a single-core CPU score of 2,582, while the iPad Air M2 was only marginally better at 2,632. This is a roughly 20 percent jump from the 10th-gen iPad, though the most recent iPad Air M3 still measures about 16-18 percent faster. But for media consumption and common work tasks, it won’t feel slow anytime soon. These performance gains are helped by the 6GB of RAM, which is 2GB more than the last model and twice as much as the 9th-gen iPad from 2021. While this is still 2GB short of the iPad Air and lower-spec iPad Pros, getting more memory for the same price is always a good thing: It lets the tablet hang onto apps and Safari tabs longer before it has to start refreshing things for new tasks. It will only improve the chances of the device holding up four or five years down the road, too. Where the iPad (A16) lags behind its higher-end siblings is multi-core and graphics performance. In Geekbench 6, the tablet’s multi-core CPU score was about 40 percent below the iPad Air M2 (6,185 vs. 10,006), while its GPU score was about 55 percent worse (19,448 vs. 42,920). Other graphics benchmarks were largely the same: It scored about 60 percent lower than the Air M2 in 3DMark’s Wild Life Extreme test (with an average of 15.2 fps vs. 37.6 fps) and anywhere between 45 to 55 percent worse on GFXBench ’s Aztec Ruins benchmark, depending on the resolution. Of course, the difference will be a little greater with the newer iPad Air M3. This sounds more dramatic on paper than it does in real life. Many everyday iPad workloads won’t tax the chip’s multi-core abilities all that hard, and the scores above are still a good 15 to 30 percent higher than the last entry-level iPad. I could still play Call of Duty Mobile at its highest settings (120 fps mode aside) without any hitches. Diablo Immortal warned that maxing out its settings would put the device under “high” load — with the Air M2, it only goes up to “medium” load — but I still got through the opening areas totally fine. (It does seem to drain the battery a bit faster, though.) You can still edit RAW photos in Lightroom or create music in GarageBand without major frustration. The iPad (A16) on top of a 13-inch iPad Air. Still, the Air is better if you ever want to push things further. This is easiest to see in the newest and most taxing iPadOS games. With Infinity Nikki , for instance, playing at ultra or high settings on the new iPad brought a constant bit of choppiness and some slowdowns during more involved animations. It also warmed up the device’s back and drained the battery faster. The game was still totally playable at medium settings, but there’s less need to knock it down on the iPad Air M2, where it looked sharper and ran smoother at high settings. Likewise, the Air will be noticeably quicker to export higher-res videos in apps like Adobe Premiere Rush. Arguably, the main benefit of the iPad Air’s M-series chip and extra RAM has less to do with today than it does the future. Features like Apple Intelligence and the Stage Manager multitasking mode aren’t available here, nor are some especially demanding games . Those aren’t essential right now — though omitting Stage Manager does make the device more cumbersome to use with an external display — but there’ll always be some risk that the next great iPadOS feature or power-hungry game won’t work (or work as well ) with this entry-level model. More storage — hallelujah The best improvement with the iPad (A16) is also the simplest: It now starts with 128GB of storage, which is twice as much as the last model. There’s also a new 512GB option for $649. There isn’t much to say about this besides “good.” It’s a common-sense upgrade that makes the tablet a much safer long-term investment than its predecessor, especially when there’s no hope of Apple ever letting us upgrade storage manually. A fine display, but it’s time to improve In his iPad Air M3 review , my colleague Nathan Ingraham argued that it’s time for Apple to update the Air’s display with a higher refresh rate or a mini LED panel , as the OLED tech exclusive to the iPad Pros represents a major upgrade on its own. Since the iPad (A16)’s screen is no different than the last one, I want to make a follow-up case for the entry-level model, albeit on a smaller scale. It&#39;s much easier to see in person than through photos, but if you look at the bottom corner of the display, near the bezel, you can see the air gap between the iPad&#39;s LCD panel and front glass. Out of context, the IPS display here is still totally adequate. It’s comfortably sized, it’s sharp enough, it’s not a massive smudge magnet and it doesn’t have any serious color accuracy issues. A tablet is nothing if not a big display, and most of the people Apple is targeting with this one will still enjoy watching and reading stuff on it. I can also live with the 60Hz refresh rate — that’s the minimum in 2025, but it’s a harsher limitation on a $599 ( or $799 ) tablet like the iPad Air than a $349 device. The other restrictions are more annoying. This screen still isn’t laminated, most notably, which means there’s a visible air gap between the LCD panel and the glass above. This helps the screen’s repairability but makes it look cheaper and feel more distant when you interact with the glass. This is particularly discernible with the Apple Pencil: Writing out notes on the iPad Air is both quieter and more natural. Those who’ve never used a higher-end iPad probably won’t care, but once you notice the difference, you can’t unsee it. The display also lacks an anti-reflective coating, so it’s worse at fending off glare. It’s certainly not unusable outdoors, but you’ll see your reflection much more clearly on the iPad (A16) than you will on the iPad Air M2 in sunlight. You’re much more likely to have to angle its display to make things out. Unlike the iPad Air and iPad Pro, the base iPad isn’t tuned for the wider P3 color space either. While the difference in color reproduction between the iPad Air and iPad (A16) is nowhere near as dramatic as the one between the Air and the iPad Pro, colors on the Air can still look slightly bolder and less washed-out when you put the two side-by-side. I appreciate that Apple wants to keep its “good, better, best” hierarchy intact, but at this point the iPad Pro’s display is so far ahead of the rest of the lineup that there’s room to even things out. If the next Air can upgrade to 120Hz, as Nathan suggests, then the next entry-level iPad should at least have a laminated display with better glare protection. Those aren’t premium features anymore. The USB-C Pencil can attach magnetically but lacks wireless charging and pressure sensitivity, so it&#39;s not a great choice for more involved work. Continued weirdness with accessories Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard support is another ongoing pain point. Like its predecessor, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with the Pencil Pro (Apple’s best stylus) or the older, second-gen Pencil. That means the only stylus you can buy with pressure sensitivity — a key feature for digital artists that lets you make darker marks by pressing down harder — is the original Pencil, which is nearly a decade old (!), isn’t as comfortable as the newer models and can’t attach to the tablet magnetically. It also requires a USB-C cable and a USB-C to Lightning adapter to charge. All of this is bad . You can still get the $79 USB-C Pencil , which is nicer to hold and can attach to the iPad’s side magnetically but isn’t pressure-sensitive and still requires a separate cable to pair and charge. Really, though, most people who want an iPad for drawing should start with the iPad Air. I’ve never been a big fan of this iPad’s Magic Keyboard Folio either, as its Surface-style kickstand is hard to keep stable on your lap and it lacks backlit keys. That’s tough given its exorbitantly high price of $249. Not built for Apple Intelligence, but that’s OK (for now) As noted above, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with Apple Intelligence, which is Apple’s catch-all term for the suite of generative AI features it’s gradually rolled out since late last year. In fact, it’s the only major device Apple has released without the AI tools since they became available. Right now, though, you won’t miss much without them. Sure, the “ Clean Up ” feature that lets you scrub unwanted objects from photos is nice. Some of the writing-assistance tools are fine if you’re completely out of gas, and being able to access ChatGPT through Siri is convenient. But just as many of the tricks are either half-cooked or, let’s say, less than essential . A promised Siri revamp has been significantly delayed . If anything, many people will appreciate that their tablet won’t push AI onto them with every update. There’s always a chance Apple Intelligence becomes more useful down the road, and buying the iPad (A16) means locking yourself out of that potential future. But it’s not there yet , and Apple is reportedly well aware of that, so we can’t call it a major omission today. Wrap-up The iPad (A16) isn’t a massive leap forward from the last entry-level iPad, and some of its display and accessory quirks are getting long in the tooth. We still recommend stepping up to the iPad Air if you can swing it: It’s faster and more futureproof, with small but meaningful upgrades to the screen, better accessory support and speakers that sound less compressed. It’s also worth the upgrade if you want to use your iPad as a pseudo laptop replacement without spending top dollar. If you see a great deal on refurbished iPad Air M2 , that’s a good buy as well. But for $250 less than the latest Air, the iPad (A16) does well to meet most iPad users where they live. It’s largely well-built and plenty quick for reading, watching and playing things, with solid battery life and an eternally easy-to-use OS. If you’re upgrading from a 9th-gen iPad or older, buying for a kid or just looking for a competent slate you won’t use for hours every day, it should be plenty of tablet for your needs. It’s not the most delightful iPad, but it’s good enough for the masses.

    "description": "Block has laid off 931 workers, which make up around eight percent of its entire staff, according to TechCrunch and The Guardian . The publications have viewed an email, wherein the financial technology company&#39;s co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, has discussed the latest organizational changes. Dorsey said that Block is eliminating roles based on three areas, starting with strategy. The company is letting 391 people go, because it&#39;s reducing &quot;teams that are off strategy.&quot; It&#39;s also parting ways with 460 workers who scored a &quot;below&quot; rating or are trending towards a &quot;below&quot; rating in its internal performance tracking metrics. Finally, Block is laying off 80 managers, as well as moving 193 to individual contributor roles, to flatten the organization and remove layers of middle management between workers and the high-level bosses they&#39;d now have to report to. In his email, Dorsey denied that the layoffs were made to hit any specific financial target and headcount goal, or because the company was replacing workers with artificial intelligence. He said that it was all about strategy and because flattening its org will allow it to &quot;move faster and with less abstraction.&quot; The CEO admitted, however, that everyone in Block has equity in the company and that the reorganization &quot;will help [it] focus and execute better to do just that.&quot; Block&#39;s stock prices have plummeted by around 30 percent this year.&nbsp; Dorsey explained that the company is laying off nearly 1,000 workers all at once instead of over time, because it&#39;s behind in its actions. &quot;We need to move to help us meet and stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in,&quot; he wrote. In addition to the layoffs, Block is also closing 748 previously open jobs and is only leaving key leadership and critical roles, along with those that have already progressed to offer stage, open. Block, which owns Square and Cash App, also underwent a reorganization in early 2024. It laid off nearly 1,000 people back then, as well, to make the company leaner and to limit its headcount to around 12,000 workers. As TechCrunch notes, Block had around 11,300 workers around the world by December 2024, which means its headcount is now far below the original goal it set for itself in 2023.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/block-reportedly-lays-off-almost-1000-employees-130056952.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best language learning apps for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-language-learning-app-120001600.html?src=rss",
    "description": "There’s a good chance learning a new language is one of your New Year’s resolutions, unless you’re hoping Google Translate will be enough for your next international adventure. Either way, you’ll need a reliable method to guide you through speaking and understanding the foreign language of your choosing. Fortunately, we're no longer confined to flashcards and textbooks as you can learn using your phone from the comfort of your couch. Many of the best language learning apps today offer a multi-tier approach, with AI-powered conversations, extensive vocab libraries and even podcasts you can listen to to help you master your target language. Whether you're just starting because you're just trying to understand what Bad Bunny means when he says \"un verano en Nueva Yol ,\" or you want to brush up on your Korean before that planned vacation, there’s a language learning app to suit your needs. Best language learning apps for 2025 Others language learning apps we tested Memrise Memrise has a library of more than 200 languages to learn. From Spanish to isiXhosa, Memrise can teach you all the basics and dive into more regional differences. As a Spanish learner, I could choose to learn from Spain or Mexico and I enjoyed that Memrise didn’t just teach me a more generalized version of the language. While Memrise could be great for polyglots, its hefty $60 monthly fee was too steep and prevented it from gleaning one of our top slots. Pimsleur Dr. Pimsleur believed speaking and listening were key to learning a new language. This app allows you to take its audio lessons offline, even going as far as integrating into Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. As a commuter, I appreciated having a lesson or two stored away for my journey to the office. However, I wanted more ways to practice reading and writing. With other apps offering podcasts for listening along and other forms of teaching, Pimsleur didn’t offer enough to make our list. Rosetta Stone Gone are the large, yellow disc sets of yesteryear; now Rosetta Stone lives squarely in the digital age with its app. Using the same visual learning tools as the old-school Rosetta Stone, the app shows you pictures and terms to get you to understand what things mean. Users can repeat after voice recordings and match phrases to the images to learn slowly. Rosetta Stone could be great for beginners, but in order to get access to all 25 languages and a lifetime subscription, you’d have to dish out $400. There are cheaper apps on this list that provide comparable experiences. HelloTalk Similar to Discord, HelloTalk provides voice and chat rooms to talk to folks from different countries. Its users can learn regional terms and talk about cultural differences. With a paid subscription, you can practice with a tutor or their AI chatbot. If you’re looking to learn a new language outside of your inner circle, HelloTalk can be a great fit. I enjoyed connecting with others on the app, but, as always when meeting strangers online, beware — some users treat it like a dating app. Fortunately, there are apps on this list that offer a similar AI learning approach without that added concern. How we test language learning apps As an intermediate Spanish learner, I was looking for an app that best catered to my needs, but I know everyone learns differently. So for each app, I assessed based on several factors. Can beginners use this to gain confidence? Will advanced speakers feel challenged? Are there enough opportunities to test reading and writing skills? How many ways can you learn vocabulary words? For those who want to have more conversations, what opportunities did each app provide to speak in that language? Bonus points if an app helped you learn a bit of the culture surrounding that language.

    "title": "The best headphones for running in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Whether you’re already an avid runner or hope to be one as you start a new training regimen, you’ll get more out of your exercise routine if you have some good music to accompany you. Getting into the zone during a long run with your preferred music, be it rap, classic rock or today’s pop hits, can totally change your experience for the better. To do that, you have to start with a good pair of running headphones. But not all wireless workout headphones are created equally, and runners need to consider specific factors before investing in a pair like how long your runs are, what type of music or other audio you prefer listening to and how much you want to block out the world during a session. I’ve tested out more than a dozen pairs to find which are the best headphones for running for all budgets and all kinds of runners. Table of contents Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones How we test headphones for running Others headphones for running we tested Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones Design Before diving in, it’s worth mentioning that this guide focuses on wireless earbuds . While you could wear over-ear or on-ear Bluetooth headphones during a run, most of the best headphones available now do not have the same level of durability. Water and dust resistance, particularly the former, is important for any audio gear you plan on sweating with or taking outdoors, and that’s more prevalent in the wireless earbuds world. Most earbuds have one of three designs: in-ear, in-ear with hook or open-ear. The first two are the most popular. In-ears are arguably the most common, while those with hooks promise better security and fit since they have an appendage that curls around the top of your ear. Open-ear designs don’t stick into your ear canal, but rather sit just outside of it. This makes it easier to hear the world around you while also listening to audio, and could be more comfortable for those who don’t like the intrusiveness of in-ear buds. Water resistance and dust protection Water resistance and dust protection are crucial for the best running headphones to have since you’ll likely be sweating while wearing them. Also, if you have the unfortunate luck of getting caught in the rain during a run, at least your gear will survive. Here’s a quick rundown of ingress protection (IP) ratings, which you’ll see attached to many earbuds on the market today. The first digit after the abbreviation rates dust protection on a scale from one to six — the higher, the better. The second digit refers to water- resistance, or waterproofing in some cases, ranked on a scale from one to nine. A letter “X” in either position means the device isn’t rated for the corresponding material. Check out this guide for an even more detailed breakdown. All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating (most have even more protection), which means they can withstand sweat and splashes but do not have dust protection. Active noise cancellation and transparency mode Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming a standard feature on wireless earbuds, at least in those above a certain price. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and continue to serve you when you’re off the trail, ANC is good to have. It adds versatility by allowing you to block out the hum of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute on public transit. But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand in hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many earbuds with ANC support some sort of “transparency mode” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for running headphones because you don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re exercising outside along busy streets. Lowering noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that. Battery life All of the earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most runners, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session. Speaking of, you’ll get an average of 20-28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a wireless charger to power up. How we test headphones for running When testing to determine the best running headphones, I wear each contender during as many runs as possible. I typically run three to five days each week, completing at least a 5K (3.01 miles) each time. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you’re on the tread or trail (as a note, I primarily run outside). I’m also paying attention to fit over time, particularly if the earbuds get slippery or loose while I sweat, or if they tend to pop out or feel less stable in my ears as I pick up speed or make quick movements. I also use the earbuds when not running to take calls and listen to music, podcasts and the like throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities. While I am also listening for audio quality, I’m admittedly not an expert in this space. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about sound quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and buying guides . Here, however, I will make note of audio-quality characteristics if they stood out to me (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’re able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases. A note about Jabra headphones Jabra announced that it will exit the consumer earbuds business , which is disappointing considering the company has made excellent headphones for running (and all other types of exercise). Our top picks include two Jabra models and we feel comfortable recommending them still because Jabra plans to support its current earbuds for &quot;several years.&quot; However, we&#39;re constantly testing new buds and reassessing our top picks, so we&#39;ll update this list accordingly in the future. Others headphones for running we tested Apple AirPods Pro The Apple AirPods Pro have an IP54 rating, which protects them from brief encounters with dust and splashes. While that’s more dust protection than many other earbuds we tested, it’s the same level of water-resistance that most exercise-specific competitors have. We generally like the AirPods Pro, but the Beats Fit Pro offer many of the same features and conveniences (namely good transparency mode and the H1 chip), with a design that’s more appropriate for working out. Beats Powerbeats Pro The Powerbeats Pro are a good alternative to the Beats Fit Pro if you’re a stickler for a hook design. However, they cost $50 more than the Fit Pro (although they’re often hovering around $180) and don’t offer any significant upgrades or additional features aside from their design. They’re also quite old at this point (having launched in 2019) and it appears Beats is putting more effort into updating its newer models instead. Anker Soundcore AeroFit Pro The Soundcore AeroFit Pro is Anker’s version of the Shokz OpenFit, but I found the fit to be less secure and not as comfortable. The actual earbuds on the AeroFit Pro are noticeably bulkier than those on the OpenFit and that caused them to shift and move much more during exercise. They never fell off of my ears completely, but I spent more time adjusting them than I did enjoying them. JBL Endurance Peak 3 The most noteworthy thing about the Endurance Peak 3 is that they have the same IP68 rating as the Jabra Elite 8 Active, except they only cost $100. But, while you get the same protection here, you’ll have to sacrifice in other areas. The Endurance Peak 3 didn’t blow me away when it came to sound quality or comfort (its hook is more rigid than those on my favorite similarly designed buds) and their charging case is massive compared to most competitors.

    "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on Disney+ and Hulu, Audible, Max and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in. Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This Amazon Spring Sale deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. The deal runs through April 30. Sling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange &amp; Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. Starz (six months) for $18 ($28 off): Starz&#39;s latest offer gives you six months of access for only $18, which shakes out to about $3 per month. This represents a 61-percent discount off the standard &quot;semi-annual&quot; plan, which puts six months of access up for $46. To get the offer, go to the Starz website and click on &quot;claim special offer.&quot; You&#39;ll have to provide your email address before the discounted rates appear. As an alternative, you could opt for the monthly plan discount, which is currently $3 per month for a total of three months. Paramount+ student discount - 50 percent off any plan: Ahead of March Madness , students can get half off any Paramount+ plan through April 8. To get the discount, scroll to the bottom of the Paramount+ homepage and click &quot;Get a 50% discount&quot; next to &quot;Are you a student?&quot; CBS shares broadcast rights with Warner Bros. Discovery this year for the men&#39;s tournament, so you&#39;ll be able to catch games on Paramount+ if you have the subscription tier that includes Showtime. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Fubo Essential for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, but Essential may be the best for most people. It offers access to 215 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. Note that regional sports content is not included here; you’ll have to go up to Pro or Elite plans for that. YouTube TV for $70/month for the first six months ($78 off): New subscribers can save a total of $78 when they sign up for YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Spotify student discount - Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. Hulu student discount - subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Max student discount - subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Sling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you&#39;ll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you&#39;ll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange &amp; Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+ and Hulu Duo Premium for $20/month : This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 47 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

    "description": "Gaming journalism stalwart Game Informer has risen from the ashes. More than thirty years after its debut issue back in August 1991, the media outlet was officially shut down by parent company GameStop in August 2024. Since then, the rights to Game Informer were acquired by Gunzilla Games and, in an all-to-rare win for today&#39;s media world, the entire team that worked for Game Informer at the time of its closure will return to their jobs. Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller posted the details about how the outlet was saved from the brink and noted that Gunzilla Games will be a hands-off boss. &quot;The new owners insisted on the idea of Game Informer remaining an independent editorial outlet,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They felt just as strongly as our team did that the only path forward was with an editorial group that made 100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so, without any influence from them or anyone else.&quot; “We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry,&quot; Gunzilla CEO and Co-Founder Vlad Korolov said . The website and its back catalog of content have been republished online. Game Informer &#39;s staff have also published reviews of more than two dozen games that came out during the site&#39;s hiatus and belatedly compiled their requisite best games of 2024 list. The print magazine is also expected to resume activity, and Miller said more details will be forthcoming about subscription and membership options. Gunzilla Games, which counts Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp among its leadership, made a battle royale shooter called Off the Grid and also developed the GUNZ blockchain platform.

    "description": "As it turns out, including a reporter in your national security leader group chat about military strikes isn&#39;t the only way to compromise sensitive information on Signal. NPR reported on Tuesday that, days after the Trump administration&#39;s preposterous and dangerous national security fumble , the Pentagon issued a warning against using the messaging app due to a phishing vulnerability. &quot;A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger application,&quot; a department-wide email obtained by NPR reads. &quot;Russian professional hacking groups are employing [Signal&#39;s] &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations.&quot; The publication says the memo states that Russian hacking groups are &quot;targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.&quot; A Signal spokesperson told NPR that the memo wasn&#39;t about Signal&#39;s security but about phishing attacks on the platform. So, if you&#39;re using the app, be especially mindful of attempts to trick you into linking devices to your account. Or simply communicate through different channels. The Pentagon directive follows a scandal that, at least in previous eras, would have ended the careers of a long list of high-profile officials. (In this one… who knows?) The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that a group of Trump administration national security officials inadvertently included him in a Signal group chat discussing military strikes in Yemen. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images The conversation included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, among others. They — with Goldberg essentially CC&#39;d — discussed the timing, targets and weapons involved in bombing Houthi sites in Yemen. A 2023 Department of Defense memo prohibited using mobile apps for even &quot;controlled unclassified information.&quot; NPR notes that military planning is many degrees more sensitive than that. And that doesn&#39;t even cover accidentally including a journalist in the conversation. The entire Atlantic article is worth a read, but a few gems from the chat include Hegseth&#39;s writing, &quot;I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It&#39;s PATHETIC.&quot; And, &quot;Nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.&quot; Adding to the &quot;It would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so dangerous&quot; nature of the fiasco, Hegseth went on camera to deny the chat&#39;s authenticity after the White House confirmed it. Although the fallout is still taking shape, here&#39;s an early taste. Watch below as retired US Navy captain and current US Senator Mark Kelly grills Gabbard and Ratcliffe on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

    "description": "We hear Signal is in the news . As longtime fans of the app, and secure messaging more broadly, we feel like it&#39;s our duty at Engadget to ensure you know how to use the software properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download Signal Signal is available on Android and iOS , as well as nearly every desktop operating system, including Windows and macOS. You can download the app by clicking one of the links provided above, or typing in &quot;Signal Messenger&quot; in your device&#39;s app store. Once you&#39;ve installed the app, proceed to set up an account using your phone number or an alias.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: If you want to install Signal on a workplace phone or computer, be sure to obtain approval from your employer; some organizations, such as the US government, either actively discourage or downright disallow use of the app.&nbsp; Create a new group Wonderful, you&#39;ve downloaded Signal! Now, to create a group chat, follow these steps:&nbsp; Tap the compose icon at the top of the interface.&nbsp; Select New Group. Add participants by selecting their name from your contact list, or inputting their username or phone number.&nbsp; Give your group a name (and a profile picture if you want).&nbsp; If the contents are especially sensitive, you may wish to enable Disappearing Messages and select an expiration time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#39;re in the process of adding new participants to a group, be sure to verify you&#39;re adding the right people. &nbsp; Some useful tips I would also suggest making use of Signal&#39;s Permissions feature to limit who can invite people to your chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings.&nbsp; Scroll down and select Permissions. Under &quot;Add Members,&quot; tap Only Admins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways someone can join your group chat is through a group link or QR Code . For additional security, you can set it so that admins must approve group link invites before the invitee can join.&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Scroll down and select Group Link.&nbsp; Switch the toggle to on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you know exactly who you can trust, but the guy down the hall might not! If you tend to get mixed up on names easily, Signal allows you to assign nicknames to users. After all, no one wants a case of mistaken identity. Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to assign a nickname to.&nbsp; Type in a name. You can also add a note, say describing the person&#39;s profession, in case you need additional context.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicknames are only visible to you, so don&#39;t be embarrassed to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp; How to remove someone from your group chat Look, even the best of us can make mistakes. Thankfully, Signal makes it easy to remove someone from a conversation thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to remove.&nbsp; Tap Remove From Group.&nbsp; How to delete messages in a Signal group chat So you somehow got through all of the above steps, added someone you shouldn&#39;t have and sent information that a relative stranger likely shouldn&#39;t have seen. Lets be honest, you&#39;re an edge case. But there&#39;s still hope if you caught your mistakes early.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap and hold the message on mobile (or hover the message bubble on desktop), Select Delete. Select Delete for Everyone. Now there&#39;s less chance of, for instance, a record of your civil and perhaps even criminal mishaps being shared to a notable reporter in a form potentially open to legal discovery.&nbsp; Ultimately, no matter how secure the messaging platform, if what you need to talk about is very, very sensitive, it&#39;s probably best to just &quot; get everyone in a room together .&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-add-someone-to-a-signal-group-chat-201430756.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed again. Publisher Paradox Interactive announced today that it is now targeting release in October 2025 instead of the first half of this year. &quot;Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date,&quot; the company said. Creating the sequel has been a trial of endurance that would test even an immortal undead&#39;s patience. Paradox parted ways with the game&#39;s original developer, Hardsuit Labs, in 2021. The Chinese Room, which made notable indie games Dear Esther and Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture , joined the project as developer in 2023. Today&#39;s update from offered some encouragement that the project is now in &quot;a late development stage,&quot; however it has decided to discontinue dev diaries that offered behind-the-scenes peeks at progress. The original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines game came out in 2004 after its own challenging development. Made by the now-shuttered Troika Studios, it was an story-driven game inspired by a tabletop RPG about several vampire clans in a modern-day Los Angeles. It was a commercial flop, but acquired a loyal audience over the years and even cultivated a community for mods and fan games .

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-uk-could-greenlight-direct-to-phone-satellite-services-this-year-183504094.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you live in a rural area of the UK, you may soon be able to use your phone for satellite calls, messages and other standard data use. On Tuesday, the nation&#39;s telecom regulator, Ofcom, proposed using direct-to-device satellite tech to connect people in the UK&#39;s &quot;most rural and hard-to-reach places,&quot; like mountains and remote villages. Ofcom sees the tech complementing traditional networks, aiming to provide 100 percent mobile coverage in the UK. The regulator said the tech could also provide backup coverage during outages, offer service to ships and passengers in coastal waters without a connection and provide emergency 999 services (the UK&#39;s version of 911) in remote areas. In January, British telecom Vodafone made the world&#39;s first satellite video call using a standard mobile phone on a remote mountain in west Wales. Regarding the regulatory details, Ofcom suggests amending existing mobile spectrum licenses for frequencies already used by cellular providers (below 3 GHz). However, the regulator also offered alternative approaches, including introducing a new license for satellite services or allowing license-exempt use if certain conditions are met. Regardless of its specific policy approach, Ofcom said strict conditions would be attached to avoid interference with existing spectrum users in the UK and overseas. Ofcom is opening a consultation period with stakeholders from now to May 20. Depending on the feedback it receives, it could begin authorizing direct-to-device calls later this year.&nbsp; The iPhone 14 series was the first standard handset to offer direct-to-satellite emergency messaging . In iOS 18, Apple expanded the functionality beyond crises to any situation where you&#39;re off the grid . The Samsung Galaxy S25 series and Google Pixel 9 recently added similar functionality .

    "description": "Sunderfolk , a game that borrows elements from tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and couch party games like Jackbox, has a launch date. The fantasy RPG from Dreamhaven (the stomping ground of Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime ) arrives on April 23. You can play a demo today through April 7. While virtual tabletops like Wizards of the Coast&#39;s Sigil act as video game-like extensions of a traditional tabletop experience, Sunderfolk &#39;s premise is in using modern technology to simulate something like D&amp;D — but with more accessibility to casual players. Here, your phone becomes the deck of cards (and controller), while your TV or monitor is the game board. Although it supports remote play, this one sounds tailor-made for couch co-op. The game&#39;s story retreads familiar fantasy tropes, like a town of peaceful inhabitants invaded by dark and creepy monsters. Here, the heroes are a clan of anthropomorphic animals who each fit a familiar class like arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger or rogue. You can customize each with weapons, armor, items and skills as they level up. (When in doubt, play the classics!) Dreamhaven &quot;We were, with Sunderfolk, really trying to create something that would inspire people to get together in person,&quot; Game Director Erin Marek said in a preview trailer. &quot;We wanted it to feel similar to a game night, getting together to play a board game or getting together to play D&amp;D with a group of friends or family or loved ones that you really care about. And to share that experience together side-by-side.&quot; You can gather your cohorts to try the game for free on GeForce Now from now to April 7. The preview gives you access to all playable characters and an early part of the game. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need a paid GeForce membership ; a free account will do. Sunderfolk will cost $50 and be playable Steam , PS5 , Xbox Series X and Switch. But only the party member running the big-screen device needs to own the game; the phone app (iOS and Android) for your pals will be a free download when the game launches on April 23.

    "description": "Google has the pedal to the metal on its AI development. Just a few months after the debut of Gemini 2.0 , the tech giant has unveiled another upgrade in Gemini 2.5 . As with any new AI launch, Google is touting a strong performance on LMArena for Gemini 2.5, particularly its capabilities in coding, mathematics and science. The first model in this series is Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Google said this is a thinking model that&#39;s intended to provide responses grounded in more reasoning, analysis and context than the answers offered by classification- and prediction-driven models. It&#39;s a different approach than Google took with the Gemini 2.0 series, which started off with the more efficient and less expensive Flash version. &quot;With Gemini 2.5, we&#39;ve achieved a new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training,&quot; the company said in a blog post attributed to Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO of Google DeepMind. &quot;Going forward, we’re building these thinking capabilities directly into all of our models, so they can handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.&quot; Google had only just started rolling out Gemini 2.0 to its services, using it to power the newly added AI Mode in search and Deep Research for handling more complex queries. With today&#39;s launch, expect to hear more updates from the company about getting this latest version. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is available now in Google AI Studio, and Gemini Advanced members can use it directly in the Gemini app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-releases-gemini-25-ai-model-for-complex-thinking-182352224.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI just announced that all users will soon be able to generate images directly inside of ChatGPT. It’s rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team and, most importantly, Free users. This will be the default image generation tool in 4o, so there will be no need to open Dall-E whenever you want to whip up a picture of a cat in space eating lasagna or whatever. The feature’s also coming to Sora. The company says that the platform will &quot;generate high-quality images based on your prompt, conversation and uploaded files.&quot; To the latter point, it’ll be able to transform pre-existing images based on prompts. OpenAI is also boasting about significant improvements in text rendering and contextual understanding. These new tools are intended for both personal and professional use. As such, OpenAI gives a number of examples as to where this type of image generation could come in handy. These include the creation of infographics, social media promotional graphics and images with plenty of text, as seen below.&nbsp; OpenAI This being a modern generation tool, it can also handle high-end visuals. The company says it offers a &quot;strong capability for photorealism, including light, shadow, and texture accuracy.&quot; The ability to understand context could also be useful, as OpenAI says this could be used to create a “poster of birds found in Central Park” or a &quot;visualization of an art history era discussed previously in the conversation.&quot; Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqN Text and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx — OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 13, 2024 It&#39;s built on GPT-4o, an AI model that was first released last year . The &quot;o&quot; stands for &quot;omni&quot;, which is a reference to the model’s multimodal capabilities. This is what allows many of the aforementioned features, like being able to iterate on uploaded files. Today’s news looks like another step on the long road toward the “one AI to rule them all” functionality that Sam Altman teased a few weeks back .

    "description": "Apple announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference will be on June 9-13. The company is usually consistent with its event timing, so Tim Cook will probably take the stage to start the keynote on June 9 at 10AM PT/1PM ET. We&#39;ve already heard that iOS 19 and macOS 16 will be sporting new looks , so expect a focus on the latest software changes. And there&#39;s no way we won&#39;t be getting more Apple Intelligence updates. It was a core part of the iOS 18.3 update that rolled out at the start of the year and Apple has had struggles with some of the AI-powered features, particularly its notification summaries . One thing we don&#39;t anticipate seeing is the long-awaited update to Siri that will offer more personalization, also courtesy of Apple Intelligence. That project hit a delay in March and, no matter how hard we might hope otherwise , it seems unlikely the issues will all be resolved by June. Although the keynote is happening in-person at Apple Park, the rest of WWDC will take place online and is free for developers to attend.

    "description": "It&#39;s your lucky day if you&#39;re looking for good deals on Apple devices . Thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale , the Apple Watch Series 10 has dropped to its lowest price to date. The smartwatch is back on sale for a record-low price of $299. That&#39;s a $100 discount. The Apple Watch SE got a discount too. The device typically retails for $249, but you can snap it up for $169 . The Apple Watch Series 10 is our pick for the best smartwatch overall . That may not necessarily apply if you&#39;re an Android user, since you need an iPhone to actually use an Apple Watch. In any case, we gave the Apple Watch Series 10 a score of 90 in our review . Apple&#39;s current flagship smartwatch has a bigger screen, making it easier to see your notifications and health data (it&#39;s a pretty dang great device for wellness and fitness tracking). The thinner frame makes it more aesthetically pleasing too. On the downside, losing the blood oxygen feature from previous models is a bummer, but that issue was out of Apple&#39;s hands to a certain extent . It&#39;s perhaps not quite worth an upgrade if you have a Series 8 or 9 already. Apple isn&#39;t exactly reinventing the wheel here. Plus the sleep apnea detection feature that debuted alongside the Series 10 is also available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Still, if you&#39;re an Apple Watch newcomer or upgrading from an even older model, the Series 10 is likely your best option, especially for the sake of future proofing.

    "description": "Waymo is continuing to expand its foothold across the US, having recently started offering paid robotaxi services in more parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. Next up are Atlanta and Miami , and now the company has revealed plans to offer its driverless Waymo One service in the nation&#39;s capital in 2026. Before that can happen, though, Waymo will need to get approval from regulators. The company says it will &quot;continue to work closely with policymakers to formalize the regulations needed to operate without a human behind the wheel in the District.&quot; DC currently requires autonomous vehicles to have a human at the wheel, ready to take control if necessary. “Our priority remains ensuring that any company operating in the District — such as Waymo — does so in a manner that prioritizes safety, aligns with our regulatory framework, and integrates seamlessly into DC’s unique transportation ecosystem,” German Vigil, a spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, told The Washington Post . He noted that the agency is refining its approach to regulation &quot;based on public input, emerging best practices and lessons learned” from other jurisdictions. Waymo has tested its vehicles in DC for several years and it plans to &quot;continue introducing ourselves to DC’s communities and emergency responders over the coming months.&quot; Per the Post , if and when Waymo One does become available in the District, the robotaxis would not take riders to any of the region&#39;s airports, as they wouldn&#39;t (at least at the outset) have a permit to cross into Maryland or Virginia.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-has-a-new-program-for-school-officials-to-report-bullying-160027748.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Instagram is adding another tool to its arsenal of anti-bullying measures. This time, however, Meta is enlisting school officials directly in an effort to speed up its response to safety issues affecting young teens. The company is introducing a new “Schools Partnership Program” that aims to give teachers and school administrators a way to intervene when students experience bullying on Instagram. The program offers schools something that many parents have long said they wanted: a way to fast-track in-app reports that directly affect young students. Meta is promising that schools who join the program will have their reports “prioritized” in its moderation queue, and that it will respond to these reports within 48 hours. Schools that sign up will also get a “school partner” badge appended to their Instagram account, along with in-app information about how to use its reporting tools and other resources. Notably though, it doesn’t sound like Meta is hiring additional content moderators to aid with these new fast-tracked reports. When asked about increasing headcount to support the program, an Instagram spokesperson told Engadget only that reports from schools will be “expedited” via its existing reporting channels, and that schools will be able to add &quot;additional context&quot; to their reports. Meta says it’s already tested the program with 60 schools and that early results have been “promising.” Now, middle schools and high schools in the United States can sign up to join a waitlist for the program. The pilot program is far from the first time Instagram has tried to address bullying. The app introduced comment limiting features in 2021 , and added a tougher &quot; restrict &quot; feature last year. But while these features can help teens avoid certain types of negative interactions, they still required teens (or their parents) to tweak their settings. By now giving schools more authority to report specific instances of bullying or other bad behavior, Meta is offering some hope that it will be easier for schools to address the underlying behavior.

    "description": "When Sony&#39;s wireless earbuds come to mind, the flagship-quality WF-1000XM5 is probably the first product that jumps out. However, the company is also adept at building budget models, blending features and tech to give users a solid value for a lot less money. That was the proposition when the WF-C700N arrived in 2023 , offering active noise cancellation (ANC), solid battery life and other features for $120. Now, Sony is back with the successor to those earbuds, the WF-C710N , that packs a host of improvements but keeps the price the same.&nbsp; First, Sony says it improved ANC performance by employing dual mics on each earbud on the C710N. The C700N only had one on each side. The company is also using AI Noise Reduction this time around to improve call quality. On the outside, Sony replaced the physical button for the onboard controls with a touch panel, and the company added wear detection for added convenience.&nbsp; You can also expect longer battery life on the C710N. At 8.5 hours with ANC enabled, that&#39;s an hour longer than the C700N. With ANC off, you can expect up to two hours more than the previous model. Additionally, total battery life including the case is doubled, with up to 30 hours of noise-canceling use available (up to 40 hours with ANC off). Sony improved the quick charge feature as well, giving you an hour of play time in five minutes instead of the previous 10-minute window. The WF-C710N is available for preorder today in black, white, pink and a transparent Glass Blue for $120. I guess Sony&#39;s confusing product names aren&#39;t entirely going away after all.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-overhauls-its-budget-earbuds-while-keeping-the-price-the-same-010025194.html?src=rss",

Very yellow.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Poco is releasing its first phone with “Ultra” branding, and on paper it lives up to the name. The F7 Ultra runs on the flagship <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273802/qualcomm-8-elite-oryon-cpu-android-smartphone-soc\">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, and combines it with a triple rear camera setup, 120W wired charging, and IP68 protection from dust and water. Despite those specs, it’s going on sale in the UK for £649 (around $835), making it one of the cheapest phones to use Qualcomm’s top tier chip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Xiaomi sub-brand Poco has always prioritized inexpensive handsets, but its F-series has been where it gets a little closer to the flagship space. The Snapdragon chip here is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, so performance should be excellent. Only the Redmagic 10 Pro offers the 8 Elite for less right now, but its gamer aesthetic is less likely to have broad appeal. Xiaomi’s software experience is substantially smoother too, and its promise of four Android updates compares pretty favorably to Redmagic’s commitment to… one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The F7 Ultra’s rear camera array includes a 50 megapixel main camera at a fast aperture of f/1.6, a 50MP 2.5x telephoto camera, and a 32MP ultrawide — plus another 32MP camera for selfies. I haven’t pushed the camera hard, but the few shots I have taken aren’t bad at all. There’s a little noise — worse if you push past the telephoto’s optical zoom into digital territory — but there’s detail, decent dynamic range, and true-to-life colors.</p>\n\n<div class=\"c-image-slider alignnone wp-block-vox-media-image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"c-image-slider__caption\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_163850.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_173736.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_173748.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_163458.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_163501.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 6.67-inch OLED display has a 1440p resolution and max refresh rate of 120Hz, and the sizable 5,300mAh battery is supported by both 120W wired charging and 50W wireless charging.

Both versions feature glossy detailing around the camera, which I’m unexpectedly fond of. The end result is a phone that looks and feels slick for a Poco, especially since it’s slim at 8.39mm, though you can tell it isn’t one of the (admittedly more expensive) flagships it’s emulating.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/poco-f7-pro.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"The Poco F7 Pro in blue, silver, and black.\" title=\"The Poco F7 Pro in blue, silver, and black.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Poco F7 Pro looks identical apart from the colors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Poco\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Poco\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The F7 Ultra is joined by a £499 (around $645) F7 Pro. This looks pretty similar, but uses the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. One upside is a bigger 6,000mAh battery, but it has slower 90W charging, and no wireless option at all. It also gets a serious camera downgrade: the main shooter is the same, but it’s only accompanied by an 8MP ultrawide and a 20MP selfie camera, with no telephoto at all. Both models are available now in the UK and Europe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/events/bigspringsale/\">Big Spring Sale</a>, as it is known, is live, and runs through Monday, March 31st, bringing with it a slew of discounts on gardening supplies, bedding, and other necessities. While the discounts aren’t as steep as during tentpole events like Prime Day or even Amazon’s October event, you can still find steep savings on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-2-TwoCameras-White/dp/B0BWX39R5W/\">security cameras</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489/\">headphones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-41mm-Smartwatch/dp/B0D912YVPQ/\">smartwatches</a>, and loads of other tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve dug into all the deals and discounts available so far, the best of which you’ll find below. By and large, most of the deals will last until the end of the event. And, while having a Prime subscription means your packages will certainly arrive more quickly, you don’t necessarily need to be a member to get in on these tried-and-tested <em>Verge</em> favorites. We’ll also be keeping an eye on deals at competing retailers, including <a href=\"https://howl.link/mnjvisoyvyd5d\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/l/target-circle-week/-/N-7196o\">Target</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#featured-deals\">Featured deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#robot-vacuum-deals\">Robot vacuum deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#headphone-and-earbud-deals\">Headphone and earbud deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#portable-charger-and-cable-deals\">Portable charger and cable deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#speaker-and-soundbar-deals\">Speaker and soundbar deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#smart-home-deals\">Smart home deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#tablet-and-e-reader-deals\">Tablet and e-reader deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#smartwatch-and-fitness-tracker-deals\">Smartwatch and fitness tracker deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#other-verge-favorites\">Other Verge favorites</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-deals\">Featured deals</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"robot-vacuum-deals\">Robot vacuum deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Dreame L20 Ultra</strong>&nbsp;is on sale for a new low of $549.99 ($450 off) at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Mop-Extend-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling-Avoidance/dp/B0CC236CLT?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0326awD__24114602__________________google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>. It lacks the self-retracting arms found on the newer, more powerful <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Removable-SideBrush-Extensive-Auto-Empty/dp/B0CXDXKSXP\">X40</a>, but otherwise it’s a great cleaning machine. The dual mop pads can still extend to clean baseboard and corners, while its 7,000Pa of suction power does a good job of sucking up unwanted dirt and debris. The robovac is also capable of emptying its own dust bin and water tanks (as well as refilling them), in addition to washing and drying its own mop pads.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Verge </em>smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy recommends the Roborock Q5 Pro for those who want a budget-friendly robot vacuum that’s skilled in the arcane art of sucking up pet hair. Fortunately, the <strong>Q5 Pro Plus</strong> model is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7VN9NWK\">Amazon</a> with its auto-empty bin for just $299.99 ($400 off) — a $70 upcharge on the standard Q50 Pro that’s well worth it if your space has a lot of fur to sweep up.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re looking for an even cheaper robot vacuum, you can buy the&nbsp;<strong>SwitchBot K10 Plus</strong>&nbsp;with a self-emptying dock for a new low of $175.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Self-Empty-Navigation-Compatible-Connected/dp/B0CHBC7BW1?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0326awD__24114602__________________google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>, down from $399.99.&nbsp;The small, quiet robovac only offers 2,500Pa suction, but that’s still powerful enough to suck up dirt from most carpets. It also offers a lidar-based mapping system, and while it lacks bells and whistles like obstacle avoidance, it at least lets you set digital keep-out zones. Plus, as an added bonus, you can use it with disposable mopping pads.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"headphone-and-earbud-deals\">Headphone and earbud deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>Beats Studio Pro </strong>are on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Beats-by-Dr-Dre-Studio-Pro-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Over-Ear-Headphones-Black/1575006069/\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/mhehlm9nwlg67\">Best Buy</a> for $179.95 ($170 off), which remains one of the best prices we’ve seen. Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C. Plus, unlike most noise-canceling headphones, they offer native support for both iOS and Android software features. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23799799/beats-studio-pro-review-apple-google-features\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you prefer a pair of noise-canceling <em>earbuds </em>that support native software features on both iOS and Android, the <strong>Beats Studio Buds Plus </strong>are available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZK2Z2TC/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Beats-Studio-Buds-True-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Earbuds-w-AppleCare-Clear/3635657547\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/lr1p0aa6xv4xx\">Best Buy</a> for around $130 ($40 off), nearly matching their best price to date. Yes, their lack of wireless charging and in-ear detection stings a bit at their typical list price, but their see-through design is slick enough that the shortcomings are (almost) forgivable. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23725921/beats-studio-buds-plus-earbuds-review-translucent-clear\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re not dead set on noise cancellation but would still like a pair of Apple earbuds, the recently released <strong>AirPods 4</strong> are matching their all-time low of $99.99 ($30 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Effortless/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-4/11381374703/\">Walmart</a> right now. They’re a substantial upgrade over the prior model when it comes to call clarity and sound, and they offer the same seamless integration with macOS, iOS, and tvOS as the rest of Apple’s earbuds. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2e</strong> — aka, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best-sounding wireless headphones</a> you can buy — are available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Over-Ear-Headphones-Model/dp/B0CH1NLX7K/\">Amazon</a> starting at $295.84 (about $103 off), or from <a href=\"https://www.bowerswilkins.com/en-us/product/over-ear-headphones/px7-s2e/300866.html\">Bower &amp; Wilkins</a> or <a href=\"https://howl.link/1nmye4atlzziq\">Best Buy</a> for $318.99 ($80 off). The British audio brand isn’t as well-known as Sony or Bose, though with the S2E, you’re getting superb sound, superior build quality, and controls that rely on physical buttons as opposed to the tap/swipe gestures found on mainstream noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s XM5.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23187234/bowers-wilkins-px7-s2-noise-canceling-headphones-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anker’s Soundcore Sport X20 earbuds</strong>&nbsp;are on sale at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-True-Wireless-Extendable-Cancelling-Waterproof/dp/B0CRT6HQ82/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howl.link/v279y814pr78e\">Best Buy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/soundcore-Sport-X20-Anker-True-Wireless-Workout-Earbuds-Rotatable-Extendable-Ear-Hooks-Noise-Cancelling-Deep-Bass-IP68-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Dustproo/5344496056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Walmart</a>&nbsp;for $63.99 ($16 off), matching their second-best price to date. The fitness-friendly buds are a lot like the Sport X10 — which were once our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23413809/best-workout-fitness-running-earbuds\">favorite budget earbuds for the gym</a>&nbsp;— only they offer longer battery life, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and multipoint support. They also supposedly offer better noise cancellation and continue to sport an adjustable ear hook, which is a boon if you’re someone who struggles with keeping traditional earbuds in during intense gym sessions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"portable-charger-and-cable-deals\">Portable charger and cable deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Power banks with built-in USB-C cables are the hot thing right now. As it turns out, having a battery pack that can charge your device in a jiffy and double as a lanyard is pretty great. Luckily, you can snag one of the most affordable 20,000mAh models out there, <strong>Anker’s 30W Zolo</strong> <strong>power bank</strong>, for $24.61 (about $11 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9LH53B?th=1\">Amazon</a>. While it’s not powerful enough to quickly charge a Steam Deck that’s running games, it’ll do just fine for charging it (as well as other USB-C devices) while they sleep.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re someone who owns (or, someday, envisions owning) USB-C gadgets that draw a lot of power, it’s wise to buy cables with high wattage passthrough, just so you’re ready for the future. <strong>Anker’s six-foot 240W USB-C cable</strong> is a great candidate, especially since it’s discounted to $16.99 ($8 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ43567W?th=1\">Amazon</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ugreen’s Uno lineup of charging accessories aims to be more personable. To that end, its <strong>6.6-foot 1ooW USB-C cable</strong> — which is currently discounted to $10.39 ($2.61 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7B719XQ?th=1\">Amazon</a> — has expressive, Tamagotchi-like eyes. The reason? There’s no reason — it’s just cute, okay?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"speaker-and-soundbar-deals\">Speaker and soundbar deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>JBL’s Charge 5</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X4YMTPM/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/4n2yt706cfa0w\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Charge-5-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Powerbank-Black/625340678\">Walmart</a> in multiple colors starting at $119.95 ($60 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker since July. We’re not huge fans of the oversized JBL logo, but the powerful Bluetooth speaker hits all the right marks when it comes to functionality and performance, offering an impressive 20 hours of battery life and a built-in USB-A port that lets you top off your phone while listening to music.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Despite the fact the Sonos app has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/630883/sonos-update-new-features-future-updates\">been a bit of a debacle</a> as of late, I have few qualms about recommending the <strong>Sonos Era 100</strong> for around $199 ($50 off), its current price at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW34LCB8/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/0o6r720ug5qld\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/era-100-black/\">Sonos’ online storefront</a>. It’s a great smart speaker with stereo sound, privacy-conscious microphone controls, and support for both Bluetooth and line-in connections. It can also connect to Spotify and every other music service you can think of and supports AirPlay 2, letting you stream content from Apple devices. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23656561/sonos-era-100-speaker-review-features\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Amazon’s latest<strong> Echo Dot</strong> is down to $39.99 ($10 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-New-release-Smart-speaker-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/hetdvyhem4v2u\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-5988952/amazon-echo-dot-5th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa.jsp/\">Kohl’s</a>. The tiny, orb-shaped smart speaker features onboard microphones and produces good sound for its size, making it a solid option for listening to music, issuing smart home commands, checking the weather, and making other various Alexa requests. It also includes a built-in temperature sensor, which can tell you the temperature in the room and trigger&nbsp;various Alexa Routines, if necessary. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23426830/echo-dot-with-clock-2022-fifth-gen-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sony’s SRS-XB100 speaker&nbsp;</strong>is available at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C29CL98P/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0325awD__632597__________________theverge.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howl.link/yr744y2ltk7bs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Best Buy</a>&nbsp;for around $48 ($12 off) or at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsony-xb100-compact-bluetooth-speaker%2F-%2FA-94091540%3Fpreselect%3D92407323%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;subId2=[vg0325awD][632597][][][][][][][][][theverge.com]\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Target</a>&nbsp;for $39.99 if you’re a member of the retailer’s free loyalty program.

The 1080p security camera boasts all the same features as the prior model — including two-way talk, color night vision, and a built-in siren — only it’s equipped with a redesigned mount that makes it easier to adjust. That said, you’ll need a Ring Protect Plan ($4.99 a month / $49.99 a year) to share or view video recordings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can grab a four-pack of<strong> Meross Smart Plug Minis</strong> on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/meross-Smart-Plug-HomeKit-Pack/dp/B084JHJBQT\">Amazon</a> for an all-time low of $28.99 ($15 off) when you clip the on-page coupon.

It’s pretty stylish, overall, and can last just as long and do just as much as a Fitbit (if not more). We also like it for its wide breadth of health and workout-tracking features, along with its support for built-in GPS and contactless payments. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23500640/garmin-venu-sq-2-review-smartwatch-fitness-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read our full review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"other-verge-favorites\">Other <em>Verge</em> favorites</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Blue Yeti microphone</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY6Z2M6/\">Amazon</a> in a myriad of colors starting at $89.99 ($40 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One of our go-to gift guide picks, the <strong>Instant Pot Duo Plus</strong>, is currently available for an all-time low of $89.95 ($40 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBKTPTS\">Amazon</a>. Multiple <em>Verge</em> staffers swear by the six-quart multi-cooker, which is similar to the base-model instant pot but comes with a few additional smart programs, including a customizable sous vide setting and a cake option that lets you pressure cook at high temperature for 40 minutes. That’s in addition to the ability to cook rice, steam veggies, and sauté, among other actions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Govee may be best known for its ambient TV backlighting, but it also makes lighting products to illuminate your entire living space in shades of RGB.

On Wednesday, the company announced a wholly online banking platform that will offer checking and savings accounts to Robinhood Gold subscribers when it launches this fall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The platform, called Robinhood Banking, will let users access their accounts, as well as send and receive money through the Robinhood Credit Card app. It even attempts to make up for not having a physical location by having physical cash “delivered on-demand right to your doorstep.” There still aren’t many details about how this will work, but Robinhood says “coverage varies based on geographic location.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/robinhood-banking-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Image: Robinhood\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Robinhood Banking promises a 4 percent annual percentage yield (APY) and FDIC insurance of up to $2.5 million on accounts. The company notes that since it’s not an FDIC-insured bank, it’s offering “pass-through” insurance provided by FDIC member Coastal Community Bank. Pass-through insurance involves insuring people’s funds by holding them “at an FDIC-insured bank through a third party,” <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/financial-institution-employees-guide-deposit-insurance/pass-through-deposit-insurance-coverage\">according to the FDIC</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The service will offer individual and joint banking accounts at launch, along with options to create children’s accounts. Deepak Rao, Robinhood Money’s general manager and vice president, says the platform is designed to “solve many of the challenges presented by legacy banks.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/robinhood-strategies.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.5129669767739,100,92.974066046452\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Robinhood Strategies can manage your investments. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Robinhood\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Robinhood\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to a bank account, Robinhood is launching a new wealth management platform called Robinhood Strategies. It will offer access to a mix of single stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which “are actively managed to provide access to more opportunities.” The funds have a 0.25 percent annual management fee, with a yearly cap of $250 for Robinhood Gold members. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Robinhood Strategies is available to Robinhood Gold members today, but it’s coming to all customers next month. <a href=\"https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/gold-overview/\">Robinhood Gold</a> is the company’s $5 per month (or $50 per year) subscription program that offers features like margin investing and larger instant deposits.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/robinhood-cortex.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Robinhood\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Later this year, Robinhood also plans to launch an AI-powered investment tool called Cortex for Gold subscribers. It will provide analyses and insights about the current market, such as why a particular stock is going up or down, as well as which stocks to consider trading.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Over the years, Robinhood has transformed itself from a simple investing app into an all-in-one hub for users’ finances. The company <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/robinhood-ventures-further-beyond-trading-with-new-credit-card-2024-03-26/\">launched a credit card</a> in 2024 as part of efforts to encourage people to keep their money within the widening Robinhood ecosystem, where they’ll now be able to store and withdraw cash to make investments on the app, too.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But in a far-from-typical political climate, the mood was tense and confrontational.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republican lawmakers are eager to revive a handful of bipartisan bills like the Kids Online Safety Act, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324276/kids-online-safety-act-parent-advocates\">House Republican leadership blocked at the finish line</a> last year. Many Democrats on the panel support these proposals, calling them an urgent response to a social crisis. But they&#8217;re raising a new question: as the Trump administration ignores congressional statutes and Supreme Court precedent to gut the federal government, will there be anyone left to enforce these laws?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last week, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/632267/democratic-ftc-commissioners-alvaro-bedoya-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-illegally-fired-trump\">abruptly —&nbsp;and under current law, illegally — attempted to fire the two sitting Democratic commissioners</a> on the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. The move left two Republicans on the commission, with one more expected to soon be confirmed. Like many agencies across the federal government, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/623242/federal-trade-commission-terminations\">FTC has seen recent staff cuts</a>, though in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621757/cfpb-doge-worker-layoffs-sworn-declaration\">far smaller numbers than many of the most prominent targets</a> of the right. Even in the minority party, Slaughter and Bedoya <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/632944/democratic-ftc-commissioner-alvaro-bedoya-tech-billionaires-trump\">warn that their removals will thwart transparency and accountability</a> for any decisions made in their absence, and they’re planning to sue to return to their work. Without dissenting voices in the room, Slaughter and Bedoya have warned, there’s no one to push back and illustrate what alternative paths the FTC could have taken, or provide important context to the agency’s decisions. “I&#8217;m going to be even more worried about actions taken to withdraw settlements, modify settlements, [and] votes taken to not sue a company,” Bedoya told reporters outside the hearing room. “If there&#8217;s an action brought up to the commission, and the commissioners say no, that never becomes public.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We had in place what was needed to protect our children,” ranking member of the commerce subcommittee Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) said in her opening remarks. “And that’s why I am absolutely furious right now that there has been this effort to fire the two members of the FTC.” The Democratic minority invited Slaughter to testify alongside witnesses invited by Republicans, including representatives from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), and Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) — the latter, as one Democrat pointed out, <a href=\"https://www.project2025.org/about/advisory-board/\">contributed to Project 2025</a>. Bedoya, though not formally invited, sat behind his colleague in the hearing room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“This hearing is about children. It’s not about what’s going on here in Washington, DC”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Republicans painted the FTC firings as a distraction. “This hearing is about children. It’s not about what’s going on here in Washington, DC,” said full committee Chair Brett Guthrie (R-KY). When reporters outside the hearing room asked about the attempted firings, subcommittee Chair Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) said he’s “focused on the hearing today.” Rep. Erin Houchin (R-IN) apologized to parents in the audience “for the things that are being taken away from this conversation not being focused on protecting children, but instead on someone’s job at the FTC.” Houchin complained that a reporter had stopped her in the hallway to ask about the agency. “Shame on the media if the only thing they cover from today is the FTC, because children are dying,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Democrats argued that laws are useless without effective enforcement, which they believe is under threat. The FTC would be primarily in charge of enforcing two major bills that passed through the House Energy and Commerce Committee last year: KOSA and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) &#8220;We can talk about the importance of passing new legislation here in this hearing,&#8221; said KOSA co-sponsor Kathy Castor (D-FL). But she questioned how they could regain trust in Republicans “ if you take the cops off the beat, you give the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347448/tech-ceos-spotted-at-the-inauguration\">Big Tech CEOs a front row seat to the inauguration</a>, [and] you block the KOSA and COPPA that was hammered out over years of work in this committee?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The questions about rule of law and who will enforce it extend far beyond the FTC. In empowering Elon Musk’s pet project, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Trump has deputized the richest man in the world to slash the federal workforce, and seek to shut down agencies created by congressional statute. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/\">asserted power over what are supposed to be independent agencies</a>, including the FTC, and loyalists he’s appointed to run them have so far welcomed him to do so. Many experts say we already are or soon could be in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/politics/constitutional-crisis-courts-trump-executive-power-what-matters/index.html\">constitutional crisis</a>, as Trump appears willing to flout everything from a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/635019/tiktok-ban-deadline-extension-trump-markey-van-hollen-booker\">law seeking to ban TikTok</a> to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/16/trump-white-house-defy-judge-deport-venezuelans\">court orders</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), ranking member of the full committee, even pointed out that Republicans were the reason KOSA didn&#8217;t pass last year. “Let’s not kid the people here to suggest that these bills are going to become law,” he said. “The bottom line is we passed KOSA and we passed COPPA out of this committee last session and the House Republican leadership refused to bring these laws to the floor. And you know why? They&#8217;re in the pocket of Big Tech. And Big Tech does not care at all about kids.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">KOSA and COPPA 2.0 both garnered criticism that, as written, they could infringe on speech and privacy. But this criticism could extend to virtually any child safety law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Slaughter echoed Democrats’ sentiment to reporters after the hearing. “You can&#8217;t meaningfully address kids online safety in bills that would empower the FTC to enforce kids online safety, if you don&#8217;t talk about whether the FTC is a functional body consistent with the design of Congress,” she said.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Trump said the taxes would go into effect on April 2nd — the same time he’s expected to introduce <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/trump-tariffs-april-2\">a round of reciprocal tariffs</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/26/business/trump-tariffs-auto-cars?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\"><em>The New York Times</em>.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tariffs, which Trump called “permanent,” would also apply to American companies that manufacture vehicles in other countries and then bring them into the US. Trump said the tariffs would result in “tremendous growth in the auto industry,” though they’re expected to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/trump-auto-tariffs-car-prices.html\">drive up prices for consumers</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/26/trump-tariffs-autos-cars\">pointed out by <em>Axios</em></a>, a <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/working_papers/ecwp_2024-02-c.pdf\">2024 analysis</a> from the US International Trade Commission found that a 25 percent tariff on cars shipped to the US could reduce imports by 74 percent, while the average vehicle price could increase by five percent.

Microsoft says this is only the beginning of the visual changes rolling out this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The update happened the same week <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/635435/discord-ui-refresh-dark-mode-new-overlay\">Discord changed its UI</a> with improved spacing between sections in the app and support for a full dark mode overlay. Both Game Bar and Discord let you view widgets while playing a game.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for the Xbox Cloud Gaming update, there’s now a way to shift between games without having to jump out and return to the Home page. For now, it only works with several <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> titles, but Xbox promises it will work with other cloud games soon. Also, Cloud Gaming is expanding more titles that support <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library\">Stream Your Own Game</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, Xbox is expanding in-game benefits to <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/26/game-pass-free-to-play-benefits/\">include more free-to-play titles</a> such as <em>Heroes in the Storm</em> and, in April, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>. It lets you acquire cosmetics, characters, in-game currency, and more in games like <em>Overwatch 2</em> and <em>Valorant</em>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1905000759336620238\">a post on Wednesday</a>, CEO Sam Altman admitted that the image-generation tool is more popular than he expected, adding that “rollout to our free tier is unfortunately going to be delayed for awhile.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">OpenAI only <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/openai/635118/chatgpt-sora-ai-image-generation-chatgpt\">just added image generation</a> capabilities to ChatGPT on Tuesday, allowing users to create images directly within the app using the company’s reasoning model, GPT-4o. Since its launch, users have flooded social media feeds with photos transformed into <a href=\"https://x.com/AntWilson/status/1904865142325797258\">images</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1904915503505670246\">generated in</a> the <a href=\"https://x.com/Discobanker/status/1904818882314903640\">style of Studio Ghibli</a>, a trend that <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1904934112806187116\">even Altman</a> has gotten in on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">GPT-4o comes with improvements to text rendering and uses “an autoregressive approach” to image generation, which means it generates an image from left to right and top to bottom instead of all at the same time. It’s currently available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers, but now it’s not clear when it will arrive for free users.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The new feature, as spotted by <a href=\"https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2025/03/26/kindle-software-update-5-18-1-released-with-unusual-new-feature/\"><em>The eBook Reader</em></a>, is listed in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW&amp;ref_=hp_201733150_Kindle-E-Reader-Software-Updat\">release notes for the 5.18.1 update</a> and can be found in Settings &gt; Device Options.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new software wasn’t immediately available as an over-the-air update for my Kindle Colorsoft, but I was able to download it and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFAE5G5UGCYA25DW\">install it manually following Amazon’s instructions</a>. The feature works well using relatively light taps anywhere on the Colorsoft, and since it requires two taps in rapid succession, it’s not easy to trigger by mistake. Unfortunately, it’s limited to just one direction. You can either use it to jump to the next page, or scroll down a long list of books. Perhaps a future update will enable triple-taps as a way to scroll up or go back to a previous page.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although the 5.18.1 software update is also available for older versions of the entry-level Kindle, Paperwhite, Scribe, and Oasis, the new double-tap feature is only available for the Colorsoft and 12th-generation Paperwhite, Amazon spokesperson Connor Rice confirmed to <em>The Verge</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, March 26th: </em></strong><em>Added confirmation from an Amazon spokesperson.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

    "description": "\n              <p>Just a few months after releasing its first <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/\">Gemini 2.0 AI models</a>, Google is upgrading again. <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/\">The company says</a> the new Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is its \"most intelligent\" model yet, offering a massive context window, multimodality, and reasoning capabilities. Google points to a raft of benchmarks that show the new Gemini clobbering other large language models (LLMs), and our testing seems to back that up—Gemini 2.5 Pro is one of the most impressive generative AI models we've seen.</p>\n<p>Gemini 2.5, like all Google's models going forward, has reasoning built in. The AI essentially fact-checks itself along the way to generating an output. We like to call this \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\">simulated reasoning</a>,\" as there's no evidence that this process is akin to human reasoning. However, it can go a long way to improving LLM outputs. Google specifically cites the model's \"agentic\" coding capabilities as a beneficiary of this process. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental can, for example, generate a full working video game from a single prompt. We've tested this, and it works with the publicly available version of the model.</p>\n<div class=\"ars-video\"><div class=\"relative\" allow=\"fullscreen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLCBSpgos6s?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent\"></div><div class=\"caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300\">\n    <div class=\"caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0\"></div>\n    <div class=\"caption-content\">\n      Gemini 2.5 Pro builds a game in one step.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Google says a lot of things about Gemini 2.5 Pro; it's smarter, it's context-aware, it <em>thinks</em>—but it's hard to quantify what constitutes improvement in generative AI bots. There are some clear technical upsides, though. Gemini 2.5 Pro comes with a 1 million token context window, which is common for the big Gemini models but massive compared to competing models like OpenAI GPT or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/\">Anthropic Claude</a>.

    "description": "\n              <p>Being Red Bull Racing 1 teammates with Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen is a hard ask. The Dutch driver took his fourth consecutive world championship last year, dominating the sport to such an extent that he led the points table across a 63-race, 1,029-day streak that only ended with McLaren and Lando Norris' victory in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/a-tough-race-for-the-rookies-as-f1-starts-2025-in-australia/\">Australia</a> earlier this month. Now we believe he's going to have his second teammate of the year, after just two races, as Red Bull gets ready to drop Liam Lawson for Yuki Tsunoda.</p>\n<p>For three of its championship years, Red Bull built the fastest car in F1, and Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez scored race wins and plenty of points to help the team secure the constructors championships in 2021, 2022, and 2023. But Red Bulls' designers have been evolving a concept that even its former design boss <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/newey-considers-if-lack-of-experience-at-red-bull-contributed-to-recent-car.63B4wB6BZK35hqwjiIZcCN\">Adrian Newey</a> thinks <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/newey-considers-if-lack-of-experience-at-red-bull-contributed-to-recent-car.63B4wB6BZK35hqwjiIZcCN\">is flawed</a>, and in 2024, we saw Perez' form evaporate after the first handful of races that year.</p>\n<p>Verstappen was able to fight for the title thanks to his considerable skill in the car. But the team lost out to both McLaren <em>and</em> Ferrari in the constructors' standings, something that will have had a very considerable impact upon the end-of-year bonuses for Red Bull's hundreds of employees.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/red-bull-makes-up-its-mind-liams-out-yukis-in-for-japan/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/red-bull-makes-up-its-mind-liams-out-yukis-in-for-japan/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

I sat down with fellow Ars staffers Aaron Zimmerman and Lee Hutchinson to talk through what we had just seen, covering everything from those goats to the show's pacing. Warning: Huge spoilers for seasons 1 and 2 follow!</p>\n<p><strong>Nate:</strong> <em>Severance</em> season 1 was a smaller-scale, almost claustrophobic show about a crazy office, its \"waffle parties,\" and the personal life of Mark Scout, mourning his dead wife and \"severing\" his consciousness to avoid that pain. It followed a compact group of characters, centered around the four \"refiners\" who worked on Lumon's severed floor. But season 2 blew up that cozy/creepy world and started following more characters—including far more \"outies\"—to far more places. Did the show manage to maintain its unique vibe while making significant changes to pacing, character count, and location?</p>\n<p><strong>Lee:</strong> I think so, but as you say, things were different this time around. One element that I’m glad carried through was the show’s consistent use of a very specific visual language. (I am an absolute sucker for visual storytelling. My favorite Kubrick film is <em>Barry Lyndon</em>. I’ll forgive a lot of plot holes if they’re beautifully shot.) Season 2, especially in the back half, treats us to an absolute smorgasbord of incredible visuals—bifurcated shots symbolizing severance and duality, stark whites and long hallways, and my personal favorite: Chris Walken in a black turtleneck seated in front of a fireplace, like Satan holding court in Hell. The storytelling might be a bit less focused, but it looks great.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/praise-kier-for-severance-season-2-lets-discuss/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/praise-kier-for-severance-season-2-lets-discuss/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

Most people use their Nvidia GPUs for games, but why not both? Nvidia has a new AI you can run at the same time, having just<a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-assist-ai-companion-for-rtx-ai-pcs/\"> released</a> its experimental G-Assist AI. It runs locally on your GPU to help you optimize your PC and get the most out of your games. It can do some neat things, but Nvidia isn't kidding when it says this tool is experimental.</p>\n<p>G-Assist is available in the Nvidia desktop app, and it consists of a floating overlay window. After invoking the overlay, you can either type or speak to G-Assist to check system stats or make tweaks to your settings. You can ask basic questions like, \"How does DLSS Frame Generation work?\" but it also has control over some system-level settings.</p>\n<p>By calling up G-Assist, you can get a rundown of how your system is running, including custom data charts created on the fly by G-Assist. You can also ask the AI to tweak your machine, for example, optimizing the settings for a particular game or toggling on or off a setting. G-Assist can even overclock your GPU if you so choose, complete with a graph of expected performance gains.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/no-cloud-needed-nvidia-creates-gaming-centric-ai-chatbot-that-runs-on-your-gpu/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/no-cloud-needed-nvidia-creates-gaming-centric-ai-chatbot-that-runs-on-your-gpu/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

    "description": "AI 技术对电力的狂热需求可以上溯到 2012 年的 AlexNet。当时多伦多大学的 AI 研究员 Alex Krizhevsky、 Ilya Sutskever 和 Geoffrey E. Hinton 正在为图像识别竞赛 ImageNet LSRVC 开发一种卷积神经网络。在当时图像识别是非常有挑战性的。研究人员认为他们需要一个庞大的神经网络，该网络以首席研究员的名字命名为 AlexNet，它有超过 6000 万参数和 65 万个神经元。但一大问题是如此大的神经网络如何进行训练？他们的实验室里有几张英伟达 GTX 580 显卡，每张配备了 3GB 显存，但 AlexNet 太大没办法加载到单张显卡上。研究人员设法将训练阶段划分到两张并行工作的 GPU 上——一半神经元在一张 GPU 上，另一半在另一张上运行。AlexNet 以压倒性优势赢得了 2012 年的比赛，从此 AI 模型的规模不再受限于单张显卡了，而妖精也从瓶子里释放了出来。在 AlexNet 之后，越来越强大的 AI 模型需要成千上万张 GPU。根据 Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)的报告，2010 年到 2020 年间数据中心的功耗相对平稳，原因是英伟达数据中心 GPU 的功耗同期提升了大约 15 倍，因此能保持数据中心功耗的稳定。到了 2022 年基于 transformer 的大模型的出现推动了数据中心功耗的大幅提升。大模型需要处理数百亿甚至数千亿个神经元，训练之后的推理阶段还需要处理大量数据。Open AI 在训练新模型时使用了超过 25,000 张英伟达 Ampere 100 GPU，持续了 100 天，耗电量 50 GW 时，足以满足一个中型城镇一年的电力需求。根据 Google 的数据，训练占 AI 模型生命周期总耗电量的四成，剩下的六成是推理。功耗的飙升促使科学家思考如何在不牺牲性能的情况下减少内存和计算要求。研究人员尝试了模型剪枝、量化等优化方法。",

    "description": "马德里卡洛斯三世大学与亚利桑那州立大学以及萨拉曼卡大学联合开展的一项科学研究表明，家族企业比非家族企业表现出更多的环境责任行为，更具可持续性。在这项研究中，家族企业被定义为创始人或其亲属、后代拥有至少 25% 投票权的企业。研究发现，当家族企业成员加入董事会并参与公司管理时，家族企业推行减少温室气体排放的绿色政策的意愿会更加强烈。该项研究基于来自22个欧洲国家的数据（研究结果可推广至整个欧洲），并表明采取此类旨在促进环境可持续性做法的家族企业也取得了优异的财务业绩。“这可能令人惊讶，但我们的研究表明，减少污染不仅不会给社会带来成本，也不会给企业带来‘经济代价’，实际上还可以提升与企业社会责任相关的行动所带来的社会和经济效益。”",

    "description": "标准宇宙模型「ΛCDM（Lambda-Cold Dark Matter，宇宙常数–冷暗物质模型）」是现代宇宙学的主流理论架构，成功解释了宇宙中大尺度结构的形成与演化。根据该模型，宇宙中仅有约 5% 的物质为的普通物质，其余则由暗物质（约25%）与暗能量（约70%）构成。暗能量被视为驱动宇宙加速膨胀的来源，并假设其能量密度随时间保持不变，也就是所谓的「宇宙常数（Λ）」。然而两项最新的大型国际合作计划，暗能量光谱仪（DESI）与暗能量调查（DES），其研究开始挑战这项假设，指出暗能量可能会随时间演化，进而动摇我们对宇宙膨胀的基本认识。根据 DESI 本身的资料分析，初步结果与标准宇宙模型 ΛCDM 基本一致。然而，当研究团队将这些观测结果进一步与宇宙微波背景辐射、超新星与弱重力透镜等其他观测资料结合时，发现暗能量的影响力可能随时间减弱，显示宇宙学常数可能并非真正的「常数」。目前的统计偏离程度为 2.8 至 4.2 个标准差，虽尚未达到物理学界公认的 5 个标准差门槛，但足以引起学术界的高度关注与讨论。",

It&#39;s echoed in the Nixon-era precept that in government and beyond, the coverup is often worse than the crime.</p><p>Naficy said that in nearly 29 years running companies, he&#39;s never fired anyone over a mistake &mdash; though has dismissed a handful of people for what he saw as malfeasance, which he said is distinct.</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t want secrets. If there&#39;s an issue &mdash; if there is a mistake that has been made &mdash; let&#39;s surface it right away,&#34; Naficy said.</p><p>The pressure can be especially intense for leaders who are, rather unrealistically, supposed to have all the answers.</p><p>Ayanna Jackson, who founded and runs AEJ Consulting, an executive coaching and career-development firm in metro Washington, DC, told BI that bosses who are dominant or conscientious in their leadership styles might have a particularly hard time facing their blunders.</p><p>&#34;Both of those styles hate to be wrong,&#34; she said.</p><p>Jackson said that if leaders don&#39;t cop to their mistakes, it can put pressure on those below them to make excuses on their behalf. That only makes things worse, she said.</p><p>&#34;The tone at the top matters,&#34; Jackson said. &#34;Things trickle down.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"e90f66da-03b5-49fa-98fa-0c133e8df227\" data-toc-id=\"e90f66da-03b5-49fa-98fa-0c133e8df227\">Not owning your mistakes can backfire</h2><p>Jackson said that rather than standing on a tarmac before reporters to downplay the security breach as Secretary Hegseth did, he could have said using Signal for a back-and-forth with other senior government officials was a mistake. Then, the focus might have turned to security protocols and considerations over commercial messaging apps.</p><p>Instead, she said, statements by Hegseth and others in the group minimizing the sensitive nature of the texts &mdash;&nbsp;essentially saying there&#39;s nothing much to see here &mdash;&nbsp;further trained the public&#39;s focus on the leaders&#39; words.</p><p>That&#39;s borne out by the fact that following officials&#39; statements, the Atlantic on Wednesday published <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/\">messages</a> from the Signal chat &mdash; two days after the initial revelations.</p><p>&#34;He would have done so much better coming out and taking ownership of it and simply saying, &#39;You know what? We recognize the error that was made,&#39;&#34; Jackson said, referring to Hegseth.</p><p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to BI that the messages make clear that classified materials and war plans weren&#39;t shared and that Secretary Hegseth &#34;was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway and had already been briefed through official channels.&#34;</p><p>The White House didn&#39;t respond to BI&#39;s request for comment on the actions of Waltz and Vice President JD Vance, among others, in using Signal to discuss military plans.</p><h2 id=\"ec28d36a-1cc4-4ac9-a689-e5bc18c3df93\" data-toc-id=\"ec28d36a-1cc4-4ac9-a689-e5bc18c3df93\"><strong>Laying it all on the table</strong></h2><p>Other leaders see room for improvement in how top government officials are handling the Signal story. Senate Majority Leader John Thune <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://x.com/mkraju/status/1904910891113406683\">told</a> CNN that those involved know they made a mistake and should act accordingly.</p><p>&#34;They should own it and fix it so that never happens again,&#34; he said.</p><p>Kyle Hanslovan knows all too well about owning up to mistakes. He served in the US Air Force and spent more than a decade working on security issues involving the National Security Agency. He&#39;s now cofounder and CEO of Huntress, a cybersecurity firm.</p><p>In 2021, Hanslovan said, an outsider gained access to Huntress&#39;s testing servers after the company left them vulnerable to intrusion. The weak spot: the password &#34;abc123!!!&#34;</p><p>He said Huntress took steps to address the hack and went public with the issue even though customer data wasn&#39;t breached.</p><p>Hanslovan, who wrote about the incident in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/investigating-unauthorized-access-huntress-qa-environment-incident\">blog</a> post, said the transparency helped the company learn while also earning respect from clients for its candor.</p><p>&#34;Coming forward, as a security company, built more credibility,&#34; he said, adding that trust in Huntress &mdash; as well as the startup&#39;s revenue &mdash; rose after the company disclosed the incident.</p><p>Hanslovan said the company didn&#39;t fire the engineer responsible but instead used the situation to help the organization improve.</p><p>&#34;That engineer has actually been a really big part of making sure that we don&#39;t make those mistakes again,&#34; Hanslovan said.</p><p>Still, when you screw up, you might want to pause &mdash; if you can. Jackson, the executive coach, said she often encourages leaders to take a beat before rushing to social or in front of a microphone.</p><p>&#34;Make sure your response is measured, appropriate, professional, and addresses the needs of the audience that you&#39;re talking to,&#34; Jackson said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/signal-government-chat-screw-up-at-work-own-it-hegseth-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Lee.</li><li>Lee, a former LinkedIn and Prezi employee, was laid off in November 2022.</li><li>She now runs RISE Learning Solutions, which she built by leveraging her personal brand and network.</li></ul><p>For a decade, I worked in tech during its golden era at LinkedIn, SlideShare, and Prezi. I was fortunate not to experience a layoff &mdash; a reality many of my friends in other industries faced, often more than once.</p><p>When <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-industry-amazon-microsoft-meta-google-companies-intensity-hardcore-2025-3\">mass layoffs in tech</a> started making headlines in late 2022, I naively believed I would be spared.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t, but my layoff was the catalyst that led to the most significant transformation of my career yet.</p><h2 id=\"a059b406-d408-4afc-a6a7-0de97f6cb188\" data-toc-id=\"a059b406-d408-4afc-a6a7-0de97f6cb188\"><strong>I still remember the calendar invite as if it were yesterday</strong></h2><p>It was titled &#34;Your Conversation,&#34; with a link to a video message from the CEO about the impending layoffs. I assumed it was an invitation to inform managers about coming changes, but then I saw my manager and an HR representative were on the invite. My stomach sank.</p><p>While <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-software-startup-prezi-grew-with-no-job-titles-2019-12\">at Prezi</a>, I built a modest side hustle as a keynote speaker and a LinkedIn Learning instructor. This side work benefited me and benefited Prezi, creating more brand awareness and visibility for the company. I became a recognized expert in virtual communication and meetings.</p><p>Yet, when friends would ask me if I ever thought of doing my own thing, I&#39;d reply, &#34;No, I like the stability of corporate.&#34;</p><p>Corporate wasn&#39;t as stable as I thought. I was laid off in November 2022, leaving behind a six-figure salary and benefits.</p><h2 id=\"4a8c2b92-78ba-45fa-84d1-a5c7fd85c501\" data-toc-id=\"4a8c2b92-78ba-45fa-84d1-a5c7fd85c501\"><strong>It can be easy for a layoff to feel personal</strong></h2><p>I spent years leading Prezi&#39;s editorial team, shaping content strategy, building internal processes, and creating product awareness.</p><p>My layoff was a harsh lesson: Even if you deliver results and are well-known and well-liked within a company, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-never-done-layoffs-cut-workers-jobs-redundancy-good-business-2025-2\">a layoff can happen to you</a>. While I could&#39;ve dwelled on the disappointment, I chose to view it as a turning point.</p><p>These three lessons transformed my mindset over the following few months and helped me recover and thrive.</p><h2 id=\"b26f93fa-0201-4881-bd12-297dc7f44ba1\" data-toc-id=\"b26f93fa-0201-4881-bd12-297dc7f44ba1\"><strong>1. Bet on your personal brand</strong></h2><p>Before Prezi, I was a founding editor at LinkedIn &mdash; my dream job then. It wasn&#39;t until I left LinkedIn that I realized how closely I had <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-youtube-laid-off-what-i-learned-2023-6\">tied my identity to the company</a>. Outside my role there, I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to be known for professionally.</p><p>That experience was a wake-up call. It taught me the importance of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-develop-personal-brand-small-business-owner-2023-11\">building your brand</a>, even when you&#39;re working for someone else. You never know when a job might end, but your brand will stay with you wherever you go.</p><p>Though thinking about your brand may feel uncomfortable, you already have one. It&#39;s essentially your reputation. You can be intentional about it or let others define it for you.</p><p>I created the EPIC Career Brand Framework,<strong> </strong>which I share in my book, &#34;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lorraineklee.com/amazon-preorder\">Unforgettable Presence</a>.&#34; I used this to build a strong professional presence and thriving business. EPIC stands for:</p><ul><li><strong>Experiences</strong>: Information about your background, professional journey, and life events that have greatly influenced you.</li><li><strong>Personality</strong>: Personality traits, soft skills, and special qualities define who you are and what you do.</li><li><strong>Identity</strong>: Your values and what you stand for, which helps people predict how you&#39;ll behave.</li><li><strong>Community</strong>: Ensuring your network sees you how you want to be seen.</li></ul><p>After my layoff, many people knew me as the editorial lead at Prezi, but they also knew me as a speaker, an instructor, and a thought leader. Knowing I already had an intentional brand gave me the confidence that I would land on my feet.</p><h2 id=\"389fccad-a4e9-46a7-a889-77d47ce0320a\" data-toc-id=\"389fccad-a4e9-46a7-a889-77d47ce0320a\"><strong>2. Operate as the CEO of your career</strong></h2><p id=\"30698468-9c37-4ef6-9592-953c38cdcbd9\">In corporate roles, it&#39;s natural to go with the flow. We work to climb the ladder, hoping our hard work will earn us promotions and raises.</p><p>One big mindset shift I adopted at Prezi was to become the CEO of my career, which meant taking my fate into my own hands. I advocated for myself and my team and asked for what I wanted, I knew when promotion cycles were and who was deciding them, and I volunteered to present during all-hands to ensure I was seen.</p><p>I had spent too much of my career waiting for opportunities to come my way instead of actively creating them. After the layoff, my mindset as the CEO of my career gave me the confidence to become the CEO of my own company, RISE Learning Solutions, in January 2023.</p><p>Whether you stay in corporate or venture out on your own, thinking like the CEO of your career changes everything. You&#39;ll start taking the initiative, advocating for yourself, and operating with a sense of purpose and control that unlocks new doors.</p><h2 id=\"d8883e70-67f7-4da3-9dbb-c63144437c47\" data-toc-id=\"d8883e70-67f7-4da3-9dbb-c63144437c47\"><strong>3. Build relationships, not just a résumé</strong></h2><p>Early in my career, I thought <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-write-a-resume-update-your-cv-in-recession-2022-8\">building a résumé</a> full of qualifications was the key to career success, but the relationships you build propel your career forward.</p><p>Even when I wasn&#39;t actively job-hunting, I continued <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-network-job-search-leveraging-personal-professional-close-connections-2025-3\">networking</a> and cultivating relationships with colleagues, mentors, and industry peers.</p><p>My connections opened new doors and introduced me to opportunities aligned with my goals. Many people reached out with job postings and ideas. Some became clients, and others became referrals. These relationships were key to my transition and continue to play a crucial role in my career today.</p><h2 id=\"d0b4fb6a-adbd-4e74-8958-a2ad869228ac\" data-toc-id=\"d0b4fb6a-adbd-4e74-8958-a2ad869228ac\"><strong>Getting laid off from Prezi is one of the best things that ever happened to me</strong></h2><p>While I experienced my fair share of panic at being laid off just before the holidays in a cool labor market, it gave me the space to make decisions that would shape my future.</p><p>These three lessons empowered me to take ownership of my journey, embrace new opportunities, and create a career that&#39;s fulfilling, impactful, and uniquely mine. I&#39;m proud to say I&#39;ve created a six-figure business that has surpassed my former corporate salary.</p><p>If you&#39;re facing a layoff, remember growth happens in the uncomfortable. The difficult setbacks you encounter are likely to propel you forward if you&#39;re willing to lean in and take action.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/blindsided-tech-layoff-decade-how-bounced-back-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

And New York City units rose 6.4% from last March to within $30 of their all-time high, Zumper noted.</p><p>Jonathan Miller, the cofounder of New York-based real-estate firm Miller Samuel, recently said his research shows that median rents in the Big Apple have never been higher. Apartment costs steadily rose from October through February &mdash; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-best-cities-for-renters-rent-savings-affordability-inflation-2024-11\">long after the peak season</a> of July and August.</p><p>Unless there&#39;s a recession, which some economists say <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/recession-states-unemployment-trump-musk-tariffs-doge-government-rosenberg-economy-2025-3\">is increasingly a risk</a>, this may continue.</p><p>&#34;If a record was set in February before the market really gets going &mdash; barring any change in the state of the economy &mdash; we could very well see new records being set quite a few more times this year,&#34; Miller told Business Insider.</p><p>Although that observation is primarily about the New York market, Miller said it could apply to the rest of the US as well, with the possible exception of the supply-dense Sun Belt region.</p><p>Apartment inventory <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-best-cities-for-renters-apartment-supply-rent-inflation-2024-7\">soared to a 50-year high last summer</a>, especially in warmer areas that became popular <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moving-during-pandemic-what-its-like-people-who-did-it-2021-12\">during the pandemic</a>. But these supply increases may have gone too far, Miller said, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-rent-apartment-affordability-best-cities-for-renters-february-2025-2\">rents are now tumbling</a> in places like North Carolina and Texas.</p><p>&#34;Within the Sun Belt, it seems very unlikely because of overbuilding and oversupply,&#34; Miller said of rent records. &#34;Outside of the Sun Belt, there&#39;s definitely potential for record or near-record prices, but it&#39;s really a local phenomenon.&#34;</p><p>The rental market is prone to the boom-bust cycle that commodities experience, so if apartment supply rises too much and brings down prices in the Sun Belt, builders will pull back. Indeed, Zumper noted that construction permits for new multi-family units are plunging right now.</p><p>In the meantime, renters may have plenty of options in the Sun Belt, but apartment availability elsewhere may be more limited. Limited supply combined with lofty mortgage rates, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-2025-outlook-home-prices-sales-mortgage-rates-zelman-2025-1\">take home purchases off the table for many</a>, mean that people may contend with higher rent prices.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re looking at weaker economic conditions in 2025 generally, but not a recession,&#34; Miller said. &#34;And I just think that, even with a weak economy, there&#39;s still a potential for higher prices.&#34;</p><p>More expensive apartments could fuel inflation, and vice versa. Zumper researchers noted that the shelter component of the consumer price index lags their firm&#39;s monthly rental data, which could mean that the consumers expecting inflation to reaccelerate may be right.</p><p>&#34;The continued rise in annual rent growth across the national rent index signals potential inflationary challenges for the Federal Reserve as it considers future rate cuts,&#34; the note read.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-rent-record-highs-inflation-expectations-economy-recession-outlook-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

As a social media marketer, much of her day is spent on the phone keeping up with local news and events, and she&#39;d hit a breaking point. &#34;It&#39;s just very overwhelming to be bombarded with news every day,&#34; the 28-year-old tells me.</p><p>Wong and her husband, a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/career-ladder-software-engineers-collapsing-ai-google-meta-coding-2025-2\">software engineer</a>, typically travel every couple of months from their hometown of Austin, spending a few days <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/least-favorite-us-cities-according-to-frequent-traveler-2024-8\">exploring cities</a> like Las Vegas, San Diego, and Martha&#39;s Vineyard. But her regular vacation wasn&#39;t going to cut it this time. Wong decided to try a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/all-inclusive-resort-worth-it-palmaia-house-of-aia-2024\">wellness retreat</a>, hoping it would help her unplug and reset her nervous system. She booked a four-night stay at the nearby <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hyatt-miraval-austin-people-test-drive-life-texas-for-18500-2021-1\">Miraval Austin Resort and Spa</a> with her husband. &#34;I think anyone who works in social media needs a reset where they don&#39;t have to be online,&#34; she says.</p><p>At the property, staff valeted her minivan and took her bags. Wong and her husband were given the choice between a backpack or tote bag containing a branded<strong> </strong>water bottle and a &#34;cellphone sleeping bag&#34; to hold their phones during their stay. (Miraval enforces a strict no-phone policy except in designated areas). &#34;It&#39;s very &#39;<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/i-work-four-seasons-thailand-white-lotus-2025-3\">White Lotus</a>&#39;,&#34; she tells me.</p><p>Between rope courses, sound bowl healing, and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-yoga-tips-longtime-yogi-things-wish-i-knew-2025-2\">yoga</a>, she and her husband would snag lunch from the build-your-own salad bar or off a menu where &#34;each dish is designed with wellness in mind,&#34; per the resort, and lounge by the pool. She tried yoga nidra, a form of meditation that promotes relaxation, which she describes as feeling like &#34;you woke up from the best nap of your life.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It feels like an adult summer camp,&#34; she says.</p><p>Since the retreat, Wong says she is able to step away from her phone more easily and spends more time outside. &#34;I&#39;ve been trying to use our patio to just take in the fresh air, look at trees, look at the sky.&#34; She and her husband are planning to go again this year. &#34;We want to hit all three properties,&#34; she tells me.</p><p>Ever since pandemic-era travel restrictions subsided, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/travel-agents-back-gen-z-millennials-vacation-planning-overseas-resorts-2024-6\">travel has boomed</a>. More recently, &#34;rest and relaxation&#34; has jumped ahead of having &#34;a fun time&#34; as the main motivation for leisure travel, according to a nationally representative 2024 survey of 1,000 US travelers from the market research firm Longwoods International. A Deloitte <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/us187281_cic_summer-travel/DI_2024-summer-travel.pdf\">survey</a> produced similar results. More people are feeling overwhelmed, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/burnout-work-boss-left-office-on-stretcher-2024-4\">burned out</a>, or just want to focus their PTO time on improving their health. A 2023 American Express travel survey found that 73% of respondents were planning vacations around improving their physical and emotional health, with millennials and Gen Z prioritizing <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2023-travel-trends-trains-retreats-and-sustainability-2023-1\">wellness travel</a> at a higher rate than older generations.</p><p>A growing obsession with wellness paired with mounting uncertainty about daily life is driving demand for relaxation. Welcome to the age of the self-care-cation.</p><hr/><p class=\"drop-cap\">As recently as five years ago, wellness could be classified as a &#34;niche segment&#34; in travel, associated primarily with weekend spa breaks and hippie yoga retreats. But since COVID, people have begun to get serious about their health. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-trends-defining-the-1-point-8-trillion-dollar-global-wellness-market-in-2024\">McKinsey</a> estimated the US market for wellness &mdash; which it defined as including better health, fitness, sleep, mindfulness, appearance, and nutrition &mdash; is up almost 7% since 2022, reaching $480 billion. Nearly 60% of respondents to the McKinsey survey said they valued wellness more in 2024 than the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of health and wellness podcasts has grown by 50% in the past five years, Nielsen found, while self-help books are one of the fastest-growing nonfiction genres. Younger generations are now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-sober-non-alcoholic-economy-restaurants-events-boom-2025-1\">shunning alcohol</a> and driving a boom in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/surrenne-inge-theron-luxury-underground-wellness-club-tracey-anderson-studio-2024-4\">bougie wellness clubs</a>.</p><p>&#34;The tourism market looks a little bit at what&#39;s happening in people&#39;s leisure time, looks at the consumer trends and thinks, &#39;How can we capitalize on this?&#39;&#34; says Melanie Kay Smith, an associate professor of tourism management at Budapest Business University.</p><es-blockquote data-styles=\"pullquote-breakout\" data-quote=\"I get home and feel filled up and energized by the experience rather than needing another holiday to get over the holiday.\" data-quote-updated=\"true\" data-source=\"Add source (optional)\" data-source-updated=\"false\">\n      <blockquote class=\"pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout\">\n        <q class=\"pullquote-quotation\">I get home and feel filled up and energized by the experience rather than needing another holiday to get over the holiday.</q>\n        \n      </blockquote>\n    </es-blockquote><p>Hilton announced in January that it now offers guided meditations, sleep stories, and mindfulness exercises from the mental-health <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tried-calm-app-month-panic-disorder-meditation-2021-5\">wellness company Calm</a> via their hotel room TVs. It also partnered with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-company-history-rise-fall-2022-2\">Peloton</a> to offer workouts from room TVs. Other brands are investing in new wellness-focused resorts, such as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://newsroom.hyatt.com/hotellacompaniadelvalle\">Hyatt&#39;s</a> new &#34;art and wellness house&#34; in Panama that&#39;s set to open soon. Accor Group plans to open 18 new luxury hotels this year and touts the wellness amenities in five of them. It&#39;s also opening a wellness-focused resort in the Caribbean later this year.</p><p>The drive for wellness isn&#39;t coming out of nowhere. In 2023, nearly half of Americans <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx\">reported</a> they frequently experienced stress, more than any other point since Gallup started tracking it in 1994. People are also becoming more anxious: In 2024, 43% of adults surveyed by the American Psychiatric Association said they <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-work-fueling-gen-z-job-anxiety-stress-mental-health-2023-12\">felt more anxious </a>than they had the previous year. &#34;As life speeds up, maybe our vacations need to be slower to compensate,&#34; says Smith.</p><p>Hotels, resorts, and retreats are stepping in to meet the need for a little TLC. In 2024, Miraval Resorts said it saw a nearly 80% increase in demand for stress management workshops over the previous year. It also said that group arrivals have increased 157% since 2021. &#34;I think the luxury consumer realizes that instead of acquiring things, acquiring experiences is much more rich,&#34; says Dina Niekamp, the associate vice president of sales, marketing, and brand for Miraval.</p><hr/><p class=\"drop-cap\">Ella Dixon-Nuttall, a 28-year-old yoga teacher from London, was tired of taking trips that revolved around <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-beach-club-resort-worth-it-families-disney-world-review-2023-1\">beach clubs</a> and drinking. So last June, she went on her first yoga retreat in Sicily with a friend. It cost £1,600, or just over $2,000, for the week and included accommodations, three meals a day, and yoga classes in the morning and evening. &#34;You got the benefit of an all-inclusive but then you also have the movement and wellness aspect,&#34; she tells me. &#34;I get home and feel filled up and energized by the experience rather than needing another holiday to get over the holiday.&#34;</p><p>Dixon-Nuttall enjoyed it so much that in February she went on her second retreat, this time with her mother. In March, she went on a third retreat in France. &#34;It&#39;s such a wonderful way to travel,&#34; she says. &#34;I&#39;m now a retreat convert to the point where if I want to go somewhere I&#39;ll look if there&#39;s a retreat there.&#34; She is looking to book another in India later this year.</p><es-blockquote data-styles=\"pullquote-right\" data-quote=\"&#39;I need you to put this in the budget for the next 20 years.&#39;\" data-quote-updated=\"true\" data-source=\"Add source (optional)\" data-source-updated=\"false\">\n      <blockquote class=\"pullquote-wrapper pullquote-right\">\n        <q class=\"pullquote-quotation\">&#39;I need you to put this in the budget for the next 20 years.&#39;</q>\n        \n      </blockquote>\n    </es-blockquote><p>Lili Paxton&#39;s mother is a similar convert. Growing up, Paxton recalls <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pros-cons-skiing-italy-vs-colorado-2025-2\">family ski trips</a> and girls getaways to Palm Springs. But at the end of 2022, Paxton and her mother were looking to book a more relaxing trip. They ended up planning a weeklong stay at Rancho La Puerta, a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lost-100-pounds-wellness-resort-hilton-head-health-review-2024-1\">wellness resort</a> and spa just over the San Diego border in Baja California, Mexico, after a family member recommended it. Weeklong rates for one person start at $5,650. Neither Paxton nor her mother had done anything like it before.</p><p>Each day hikes were offered at 5:30 a.m. Classes were available each hour for everything from Pilates to pickleball. Paxton&#39;s mother tried Watsu &mdash; a type of water therapy that uses massage, stretching, and acupressure &mdash; for the first time. &#34;She said it was the most spiritual experience,&#34; Paxton says. &#34;She said that she saw my dead father under the water.&#34;</p><p>When Paxton wasn&#39;t hiking or exercising, she was at the spa or relaxing by the pool. &#34;The whole time I was just really happy,&#34; she says. &#34;It felt like an escape from reality.&#34;</p><p>Her mother left the trip transformed. &#34;My mom is committed to going every year until she dies,&#34; says Paxton. &#34;She even talked to her financial planner and was like, &#39;I need you to put this in the budget for the next 20 years.&#39;&#34; They spent another week at the retreat this past Christmas.</p><hr/><p class=\"drop-cap\">While many people are happy to pay a premium for a chance to indulge in simple things like walking in nature or taking a deep breath, for others, wellness is becoming <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rich-people-obsessed-longevity-luxury-hotels-iv-drips-mri-scans-2024-10\">increasingly high-tech</a>. Since 2008, the wellness resort Sha has been at the forefront of holistic health, offering around 1,000 different treatments in nearly 40 different medical and health specialties at its locations in Spain and Mexico. Stays at the resort start at 550 euros a night, or roughly $600, while specialized four-day programs start at 2,500 euros, or about $2,700, with add-ons for treatments focused on sexual well-being, sleep recovery, stress management, gut health, quitting smoking, and more.</p><p>The &#34;Leader&#39;s Performance&#34; program, for example, starts with an advanced preventive diagnosis that tests body composition, cognitive abilities, and advanced glycation end-product accumulation &mdash; compounds that are linked with aging. Guests can also participate in clinical analyses, such as an oxidative stress test and a tailored meal plan with nutritional monitoring.</p><p>Almost every type of treatment imaginable is available at Sha: stem cell treatment, advanced plasma renewal, hormone replacement therapy, sleep diagnosis. All guests receive an alkalizing diet tailored to their individual nutritional needs. &#34;Even if you go to see all these different experts in the city, first, it will take you months to see them all, then there will be no coordination between them,&#34; Alejandro Bataller, Sha&#39;s vice president, says. &#34;We&#39;re probably the most comprehensive.&#34;</p><p>While Sha appeals to a range of health-conscious consumers, Bataller has noticed an increase over the past two or three years in customers he calls &#34;<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biohackers-build-house-to-help-them-live-longer-cost-features-2025-3\">biohackers</a>.&#34; These are people who already have a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/74-year-old-exercise-routine-longevity-daily-strength-cardio-workouts-2025-3\">longevity doctor</a>, nutritionist, and functional medicine doctor on speed dial, who take 40-plus supplements a day and invest in the latest high-tech treatments. &#34;They don&#39;t want a standard program,&#34; he says. &#34;They come to Sha because they know that Sha is always cutting edge.&#34;</p><es-blockquote data-styles=\"pullquote-breakout\" data-quote=\"It&#39;s looking as if you&#39;ve funneled thousands and tens of thousands of dollars into your face and body.

That&#39;s not health; that&#39;s products, that&#39;s procedures.&#34;</p><p>Of course, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/men-corporate-america-expensive-beauty-routines-spending-thousands-2024-12\">products and procedures</a> are all the rage right now as people look for alternative approaches to well-being. &#34;Our culture is largely unwell,&#34; DeFino explains. Only 36% of Americans have at least &#34;quite a lot&#34; of trust in the medical system, a 2024 Gallup survey found, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/11/americans-living-with-diseases-health-study\">studies</a> show that Americans are sicker than people in many parts of the world. Only about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.medtronic.com/2024-04-17-Americans-favor-quality-over-quantity-in-pursuit-of-longevity\">half of Americans</a> focus on eating healthy and exercising, despite diet and physical inactivity being leading contributors to chronic disease. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/saratoga-water-exec-says-ashton-hall-morning-routine-is-amazing-2025-3\">Wellness gurus</a> have stepped in to fill the gap left by a flagging healthcare system. Across social platforms, they document macros consumed and hours spent in REM, while touting the benefits of cryotherapy, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-clinic-owner-reverse-biological-age-biohack-sleep-red-light-2025-2\">red-light therapy</a>, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. &#34;The draw of wellness for the average person is it offers an individualized solution to a collective issue,&#34; DeFino says, adding: &#34;A lot of this is an attempt to intellectualize these arbitrary, oppressive beauty standards and make them seem like smart investments.&#34;</p><p>That doesn&#39;t mean the pursuit of chilling out isn&#39;t worth it. A 2023 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9869067/\">study</a> that reviewed 68 articles from 2002 to 2022 found that wellness tourism &mdash; defined as any tourism activities pursued with the goal of maintaining or improving health &mdash; could offer both psychological and quality-of-life benefits. However, these benefits vary from person to person, making it challenging to measure them.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to get carried away thinking we all need cutting-edge treatments to get by. &#34;It&#39;s great to step out of your everyday life and relax,&#34; says DeFino. &#34;Collectively, we also have to be focusing on how we create lives that we don&#39;t need to step out of all of the time.&#34;</p><hr/><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/author/eve-upton-clark\"><em><u>Eve Upton-Clark</u></em></a><em> is a features writer covering culture and society.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vacation-wellness-retreats-resorts-booming-stress-health-relaxation-self-care-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

He&#39;s a moral person &mdash; his mother raised him right. And by his internal calculation, it&#39;s OK to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-class-shoplifting-retail-theft-crime-stealing-stores-2024-11\">shoplift from Whole Foods</a>. Why? Because of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-life-career-education\">Jeff Bezos</a>.</p><p>From about 2020 to 2022, Lee, a 20-something communications professional living in the Washington, DC, area, engaged in what he describes as &#34;grand theft auto-ing&#34; from his local Whole Foods store. He would cheat the scale at the hot bar, pocket spices, or take home four lemons in the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rich-people-shoplift-self-checkout-why-explained-2023-12\">self-checkout</a> aisle while only declaring two. Lee has never shoplifted from anywhere else &mdash; not Safeway, not a local store. He&#39;s largely stopped taking from Whole Foods because he moved to a different neighborhood that doesn&#39;t have one. However, he told me, there&#39;s one by his gym he&#39;ll pop into &mdash; and steal from &mdash; from time to time.</p><p>Lee has weighed the ethics of what he&#39;s doing. At one point, the guilt got to be so much that he confessed his misdeeds to his mother. Once he explained his reasoning &mdash; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon\">Amazon</a>&#39;s market power, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-net-worth\">Bezos&#39; wealth</a>, what the billionaire has done at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-washington-post-donald-trump-why-own-explained-2025-02\">The Washington Post</a> &mdash; she came around.</p><p>&#34;If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too,&#34; Lee says. Lee is a pseudonym &mdash; the same goes for all of the shoplifters and ethically (and legally) compromised individuals quoted in this story. Over the past several months, I&#39;ve spoken with nearly a dozen of them &mdash; some I found through their confessions online; others reached out when they heard through social media I was working on this story.</p><p>Practically speaking, it&#39;s a good moment to be a billionaire in America &mdash; you&#39;ve probably got more <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-pay-in-taxes-trump-tax-bill-expiring-2025-1\">tax cuts</a> on the way, and the president is nice to you as long as you&#39;re <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-inauguration-ceo-guests-bezos-zuckerberg-musk-2025-1\">nice to him</a>. Maybe your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-billionaires-wealth-stocks-musk-trump-bezos-crash-recession-economy-2025-3\">stocks are down</a>, but you&#39;re still a billionaire, so it&#39;s fine. In terms of public perception, however, the superrich have seen better days. Americans are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-responds-tesla-vandalism-protests-2025-3\">vandalizing Teslas</a> to get back at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>. Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s &#34;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-honeymoon-period-over-trump-inauguration-2025-1\">Zuckermoon</a>&#34; is over. As for Jeff Bezos, some people are stealing from him &mdash; or, rather, his companies &mdash; in an effort to exact revenge. Like Lee, they&#39;re enacting some moral payback, one fancy cheese from Whole Foods or fudged Amazon return at a time. They&#39;re sticking it to The Man, who in this case is one specific individual.</p><p>These subversive infractions directed at Bezos and his billionaire cohort may be rooted in legitimate gripes with the state of the world and its unfathomable wealth inequality. On the spectrum of crime severity, swiping $20 worth of goods from a multibillion-dollar corporation does not rank high. But the justifications people offer are just that &mdash; justifications. None of what they&#39;re doing is actually making the type of impact they might like to see, and they&#39;re conveniently ignoring Bezos&#39; positive contributions, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-pledges-give-away-fortune-amazon-2022-11\">such as his philanthropy</a>. And they could be causing unintended harm to the non-Bezoses of the world, as in, everyone else. Many retailers have put items behind glass cases to combat theft, which is a headache for everybody. Shoplifting can demoralize workers, and if enough people do it, it may lead companies to raise prices, or in the case of return fraud, mean <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/free-shipping-free-returns-online-shopping-companies-charging-expensive-amazon-2024-2\">businesses make sending unwanted items back</a> a lot harder.</p><hr/><p class=\"drop-cap\">In the realm of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/shoplifting-biggest-enablers-might-be-retailers-themselves-walmart-target-2024-4\">retail theft</a>, middle-class consumers and opportunist thieves are a growing group of culprits. It&#39;s difficult to tease out the exact size and scope of the cohort, given how <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/myth-vs-reality-trends-retail-theft\">incomplete retail-theft data can be</a>. Amazon isn&#39;t exactly shouting its shrink numbers from the rooftops, and other companies have even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walgreens-exec-says-company-overstated-theft-may-cut-back-security-2023-1\">admitted to mistakes in assessing the problem</a>. But as one loss prevention professional put it to me last year, everyday, ordinary shoplifters are &#34;like a giant organized mob, they just don&#39;t know each other.&#34;</p><es-blockquote data-styles=\"pullquote-breakout\" data-quote=\"If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too.\" data-quote-updated=\"true\" data-source=\"Add source (optional)\" data-source-updated=\"false\">\n      <blockquote class=\"pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout\">\n        <q class=\"pullquote-quotation\">If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too.</q>\n        \n      </blockquote>\n    </es-blockquote><p>Many of them abide by a certain code around who they take from, and the swath of small-time larcenists I&#39;ve spoken to consistently say that anything Jeff Bezos-related falls into the &#34;allowed&#34; column.

They feel like they&#39;re balancing the scales in stealing from one of his companies, undertaking some sort of Robin Hood-esque endeavor where they take from the rich to give to the poor, the comparatively poor being themselves.</p><p>Take Jesse, a 30-something tech worker who until recently would steal entire bags of groceries from Whole Foods with his roommates. A friend at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instacart-shopper-works-18-hour-days-road-trips-cities-orders-2023-8\">Instacart</a> tipped them off to the opportunity &mdash; with so many <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/things-to-stop-doing-when-ordering-groceries-online-instacart-2021-9\">personal shoppers roaming around the aisles</a>, workers weren&#39;t going to notice another person loading bags or whether they were paying for what was in them. Once, they got expensive steaks from the butcher and left without paying for them, later grilling them out on a friend&#39;s roof.</p><p>&#34;I never felt bad for the corporation as a whole, because it was Amazon and, you know, it was Jeff Bezos,&#34; Jesse said. &#34;He just profits so much taking advantage of the little people, so if we as little people can bite back a little bit, and that&#39;s me taking $100 maybe out of revenue for him, that&#39;s a little bit of a middle finger.&#34;</p><p>Separately, there&#39;s Carson, another Whole Foods bandit whose friends joke they&#39;re actually &#34;liberating&#34; items from the store, not stealing. As Carson, a 30-something who works in the nonprofit sector, told me for a story last year, he likes slipping salmon lox into his laptop sleeve and estimates he saves about $1,000 in groceries a year by shoplifting, largely from Whole Foods.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s easy to look at him like a Lex Luthor,&#34; Carson told me recently, referring to the Superman villain.</p><p>Carson isn&#39;t just extracting his purported payback through Whole Foods. He likes to throw big, complicated parties, so he&#39;ll buy $1,000 of decorations from Amazon, use them, and then return them.</p><p>&#34;Who&#39;s actually hurt in this strange, dehumanized system?&#34; he said.</p><p>Reporting for this story, I heard the same sentiment over and over from shoplifters and less-than-honest Amazon shoppers. One Whole Foods nabber, a 30-something tech worker, justified their penchant for lifting from the grocery store as a mix of ease, quality, and antipathy toward one of the richest people in the world. &#34;My lack of remorse for any of this is &mdash; it&#39;s a big corporation. They have so much money, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/egg-prices-expensive-avian-bird-flu-changing-tastes-cage-free-2025-1\">eggs are $10</a>, screw them,&#34; they said.</p><es-blockquote data-styles=\"pullquote-right\" data-quote=\"I feel like the Batman of returns.

When I asked whether they felt any sense of regret, the answer was succinct: &#34;F&mdash; no. He&#39;s the most successful entrepreneur alive.&#34;</p><p>Jimmy, a 30-something government worker, told me he&#39;s &#34;indifferent&#34; toward Bezos, and he does feel somewhat bad about engaging in some light <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-suing-refund-fraud-group-it-says-stole-10000-items-2024-7\">return fraud</a>. One of his gaming controllers recently broke, so he bought a new one, stuck the old one in the box it came in, and sent it back undetected. Still, he&#39;s not losing sleep over it. &#34;We know how much money that company makes. They&#39;re not going to be worried about that $70,&#34; he says. &#34;I feel like the Batman of returns. I choose my targets.&#34;</p><hr/><p class=\"drop-cap\">The Bezos bashers&#39; complaints ran the gamut: Whole Foods is a gentrifier; he&#39;s just too rich; shooting himself into space is gauche. Whatever anyone&#39;s precise justifications, there have been plenty of headlines and accusations that paint Bezos and his companies in an unflattering light. Amazon&#39;s e-commerce practices are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-shipment-zero-gives-up-most-important-part-climate-pledge-2023-5\">bad for the environment</a>. His businesses have been widely criticized for their approach to workers, including subjecting them to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-describe-peak-2019-2\">brutal work conditions</a> and engaging in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-settles-8-million-wage-theft-lawsuit-contract-delivery-drivers-2021-3\">wage theft</a>. His recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-jeff-bezos-donald-trump-feud-relationship-history-2024-11\">political turn</a> and push to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-wapo-memo-reveals-big-changes-coming-to-bezos-newsroom-2025-3\">exert more influence</a> over The Washington Post, which he owns, has turned many people off and reportedly lost the paper thousands of subscribers.</p><p>To be sure, Bezos has also given people plenty to be happy about. It&#39;s super convenient to have stuff delivered to your door at the drop of a hat. Whole Foods is, for the most part, a lovely shopping experience. But in an era where billionaires are viewed as the bad guys, and there&#39;s growing anger about extreme wealth inequality, it can be easy for people to overlook any upsides. There are a handful of guys in popular culture who epitomize the enormous gap between haves and have-nots. Bezos is one of them.</p><p>It is fair to wonder, though, if stealing from Whole Foods or returning a dress you wore to a wedding is the best way to get back at Bezos. It&#39;s a bit of a stretch to think the answer to that one is yes.</p><es-blockquote data-styles=\"pullquote-breakout\" data-quote=\"The target is misapplied, but the anger is, I would say, understandable.\" data-quote-updated=\"true\" data-source=\"Add source (optional)\" data-source-updated=\"false\">\n      <blockquote class=\"pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout\">\n        <q class=\"pullquote-quotation\">The target is misapplied, but the anger is, I would say, understandable.</q>\n        \n      </blockquote>\n    </es-blockquote><p>I reached out to Garret Merriam, an associate philosophy professor at California State University, Sacramento, who studies ethics, to get his read. He told me there are likely three broad categories of thinking going on here. There are those who don&#39;t really consider what they&#39;re doing to be stealing &mdash; they&#39;re oblivious to it. Like taking a pen from the breakroom at work, they figure it&#39;s baked in when they grab a snack as they browse the Whole Foods aisles. There are people who recognize it&#39;s cheating, but they don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong, given Bezos&#39; wealth and his business practices. In a context where Amazon has paid millions of dollars to settle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-paying-millions-to-workers-over-bag-check-lawsuit-2021-7\">wage theft lawsuits</a>, they figure lying about a lost package is a small way to try to even things out. And then there are those who feel a sense of political desperation &mdash; they&#39;re powerless in the face of massive political and economic forces, and this is an outlet for some sort of action, even if futile. &#34;The target is misapplied, but the anger is, I would say, understandable,&#34; he said.</p><p>People have a tendency to try to neutralize potentially unsavory behavior by coming up with ways to justify their actions, Emmeline Taylor, a professor of criminology at City St. George&#39;s, University of London, said. In this case, they tell themselves things like, &#34;Bezos is bad, Amazon won&#39;t even notice, this seems like a victimless crime,&#34; to make themselves feel better and like they&#39;re in the right. &#34;They&#39;ve sort of rehearsed this in their head so many times or even said it out loud, they start to believe it themselves,&#34; she said. &#34;That&#39;s what allows them these sorts of moral gymnastics.&#34;</p><p>While people may see their actions as a way to get back at Bezos, the sheer size of the modern corporation creates a level of removal that makes it easy to sit back and think, &#34;Who cares if someone pulls one over on them?&#34; After all, it feels like they&#39;re pulling one over on us all the time.</p><p>&#34;When we take from a store or a workplace, it gets a little bit easier to distance yourself,&#34; Terrence Shulman, the founder of the Shulman Center for Compulsive Theft, Spending, and Hoarding, said.</p><p>Beyond the fact that theft and fraud are, you know, against the law, anti-Amazon avengers may not recognize the collateral damage they could be inadvertently causing. If you steal from Whole Foods, Bezos won&#39;t know, but the store manager who&#39;s fired over it will. (I did survey some Whole Foods workers about this, and several of them confirmed that (a) they see a lot of middle-class and even seemingly wealthy shoplifters, and (b) they may be a little bothered by some of it but are not in a tizzy.) Before you lie to Amazon that your package never arrived or return the wrong item, you might want to check who the actual seller is.</p><p>John Roman, the CEO of BattlBox, which sells outdoor gear and equipment, would rather just sell everything from his own website, but they&#39;ve got to be on Amazon and other e-commerce platforms just because of the reach. He&#39;s currently dealing with a return fraud situation &mdash; someone bought a new spotlight from him, said they didn&#39;t like it, and shipped an older model back. BattlBox didn&#39;t even realize what had happened until they sent the returned item to another customer who flagged it. Roman has filed an appeal with Amazon, but there&#39;s &#34;no telling&#34; whether the company will side with him.</p><p>He doesn&#39;t really blame people for doing this. By making returns so easy and taking &#34;the customer is right&#34; philosophy to the extreme, Amazon has fostered this behavior. &#34;I don&#39;t think the average consumer even understands that it&#39;s not Amazon selling the product,&#34; he said, pointing to the fact that Amazon <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-copied-third-party-sellers-competitors-india-reuters-report-2021-10\">regularly introduces an Amazon Basic version of a best-selling item</a> &mdash; which then gets prominent website placement near or above the original &mdash; in order to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-third-party-sellers-data-create-competing-private-label-products-2020-4\">get in on the action</a>. Roman even understands the get-back-at-Bezos stuff, given how the ultrawealthy are viewed.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, but I fully understand the people that view that they&#39;re giving it to The Man, but the reality is that you are actually hurting small businesses,&#34; he said.</p><p>Ironically, shoplifting at other retailers has been a plus for Amazon&#39;s business &mdash; people frustrated that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/locked-up-merchandise-drugstores-annoys-shoppers-cvs-walgreens-rite-aid-2024-8\">everything is locked up at CVS</a> and Target just go to Amazon&#39;s website instead. It&#39;s not clear how big of a problem shrink is for Whole Foods and Amazon since the company doesn&#39;t break it out in their financials. When Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked about return fraud in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slOexY99c5s\">CNBC interview</a> last year, he sort of shrugged it off, saying at the company&#39;s scale, &#34;You get a bit of everything.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It matters to them, but does it matter enough to put the time and effort into trying to stop that? I would say probably not,&#34; Arun Sundaram, an analyst at CFRA Research, said. He joked that given how profitable some other arms of Amazon&#39;s business arms are, if it wanted to give free food to customers for a month, it probably could.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this story. Jeff Bezos did not respond to a request for comment.</p><hr/><p class=\"drop-cap\">I&#39;m not trying to say that the logic among Amazon and Whole Foods thieves is, &#34;I woke up in the morning mad at Jeff Bezos because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-owned-washington-post-wont-endorse-presidential-candidate-2024-10\">killed The Washington Post&#39;s Kamala Harris endorsement</a>, so now I&#39;m going to steal overpriced salami from Whole Foods.&#34; Attitudes are generally more removed and hazy. They view snacking while shopping (without paying for said snack) as a victimless crime, with the only potential victim being Bezos, even if that&#39;s a stretch.</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t know who I&#39;m hurting,&#34; Lee said.</p><p>In the current economy, it&#39;s hard not to feel like you&#39;re being taken advantage of at every turn. Everything&#39;s getting more expensive, but corporate profits are still going up. Companies are constantly cutting costs, whether that means <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/recent-company-layoffs-laying-off-workers-2025\">laying off workers</a> or making it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/customer-service-phone-calls-paid-status-symbol-luxury-2024-9\">impossible to talk to a customer service representative</a> on the phone. People feel like they have to be on guard against business trickery and slights. If you&#39;ve shrugged and said, &#34;That&#39;s how they get you,&#34; enough times, you start to think about how you&#39;ll get them. People feel like big business <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://research.reading.ac.uk/research-blog/2022/06/01/is-it-wrong-to-steal-from-large-corporations-a-philosopher-debates-the-ethics/\">has broken the social contract</a>, so they can break it back.</p><p>If people want to hurt Amazon with their pocketbooks, the best thing they can probably do is just not shop there. But that would require effort, planning, and forgoing the luxuries of on-demand shopping, which many people don&#39;t seem so willing to do.</p><p>&#34;That would be a moral response,&#34; said Stuart Green, a Rutgers law professor who focuses on the moral theory underlying laws. &#34;I don&#39;t think you can steal things that you like and then say you&#39;re doing it because you don&#39;t like the company.&#34;</p><p>At least it&#39;s better than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-fires-protesters-stop-being-psycho-2025-3\">setting Teslas on fire</a>.</p><hr/><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/author/emily-stewart\"><em>Emily Stewart</em></a><em> is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stealing-amazon-whole-foods-jeff-bezos-retail-theft-fraud-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Zhao said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-hot-jobs-tech-layoffs-healthcare-government-careers-2024-7\">healthcare</a> is not as subject to the business cycle as other sectors. Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said there&#39;s a lot of hiring happening in this sector, while tech and other knowledge worker gigs aren&#39;t seeing as much hiring.</p><p>&#34;You don&#39;t choose what time you&#39;re in the job market, but you can choose which part of the job market you focus on,&#34; Zhao said.</p><h2 id=\"ee8ce9a8-c88c-4c6e-a96e-e094ef4a53a4\" data-toc-id=\"ee8ce9a8-c88c-4c6e-a96e-e094ef4a53a4\">Too many applicants for a role</h2><p>For the jobs that are available, employers may not have enough hands to go through or respond to each applicant.

Dilber said many of the people were well-qualified for the role.</p><p>&#34;It was just seeing that a lot of people who really have the skills and could probably do the job pretty well are not even going to be able to get interviews because there are just so many people who are also on the market competing for a small number of jobs,&#34; she said.</p><h2 id=\"1dff5cd4-5811-4579-aa82-acbd9915fd4c\" data-toc-id=\"1dff5cd4-5811-4579-aa82-acbd9915fd4c\">There&#39;s no true formula for getting a job</h2><p>There could be things you can do to try to move along the job process.</p><p>Dilber doesn&#39;t recommend applying to every job opening you see and instead focusing on postings you are &#34;well qualified&#34; for. &#34;Mass applying is actually hurting people because they&#39;re putting in lower quality applications that aren&#39;t going to stand up in a competitive applicant tool,&#34; she said.</p><p>Nolan doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s a clear formula for standing out in the job search or getting that first interview. However, she recommends strategic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-network-for-new-job-microsoft-vp-hr-explains-2024-6\">networking</a>, like reaching out to existing connections and to people you admire in your field of work.</p><p>&#34;Something that can sometimes be underrated is asking for what you want, putting it out there, whether it&#39;s on LinkedIn, whether it&#39;s writing an email to folks you might know in your industry,&#34; she said.</p><p>Nolan said your LinkedIn profile should be a version of your <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cant-get-job-what-to-never-always-include-resume-hiring-2024-10\">résumé</a> because recruiters tend to check it in addition to résumés submitted.</p><p>Beyond doing the typical grunt work of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/find-job-searching-hunt-tips-2024-12\">finding a job</a>, Nolan said to be patient and to take care of yourself.

His face was obscured, and the air force said it withheld the pilot&#39;s name and call sign for security purposes.</p><p>&#34;With the arrival of Western equipment, the situation with carrying out fighter cover missions has improved,&#34; the pilot said in Ukrainian. &#34;We now have different weaponry, more high-quality weaponry. The Russians understand that as well.&#34;</p><p>He said Ukraine had been deploying its <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ukraine-could-get-air-superiority-use-f-16s-experts-2024-7\">American F-16 Fighting Falcons</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mirage-fighter-jets-good-planes-arent-best-western-aircraft-ukraine-2024-6\">French Mirage 2000-5s</a> in more close-range encounters.</p><p>&#34;From their actions, we can see that they are starting to retreat. They are afraid to approach us,&#34; he added. &#34;After all, there is a living person sitting there, too, who also does not want to die.&#34;</p><p>The pilot said Ukraine had been using its F-16s for tactical strikes such as &#34;a scalpel,&#34; while its Soviet <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/video-ukrainian-mig-29-fighter-jet-makes-incredibly-low-pass-2023-11\">MiG-29s</a>, Su-24s, and Su-27s were assigned more widely to suppress and destroy targets such as &#34;hammers and sledgehammers.&#34;</p><p>Ukraine&#39;s Soviet aircraft are often sent to bomb Russian targets at close range, which the pilot said meant his comrades had to fly &#34;dangerously close to the front line.&#34;</p><p>So Ukraine sends it F-16s and Mirages to provide cover for their Soviet counterparts, he said.</p><p>That style of attack has materially changed how Moscow&#39;s troops react, the pilot added.</p><p>&#34;They know roughly the technical characteristics of our weaponry. They know where to advance, where to retreat,&#34; he said, adding that Ukraine had been trying to exploit those gaps.</p><p>The pilot also said the F-16 and Mirage offered Ukraine the ability to conduct &#34;very, very precise&#34; strikes.</p><p>&#34;At the moment, we can only strike at tactical depth,&#34; he said of Ukrainian pilots assigned to NATO fighters. &#34;But these attacks are extremely precise.&#34;</p><p>&#34;If we want, our bomb can fly straight through someone&#39;s window,&#34; he added.</p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry didn&#39;t respond to a comment request.</p><h2 id=\"7d3fac08-12cb-4e86-854a-1e1873ee0a1c\" data-toc-id=\"7d3fac08-12cb-4e86-854a-1e1873ee0a1c\">The F-16&#39;s edge over Ukraine&#39;s Soviet aircraft</h2><p>The F-16 is an older design by Western standards &mdash; with more than <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/f-16-50th-anniversary-of-flying-viper-photos-2024-1\">50 years of service</a> &mdash; but is still valued by Ukraine for its ability to carry and launch a wide array of NATO precision-guided munitions against both air and land targets.</p><p>These include the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/videos-capture-back-to-back-ukrainian-strikes-on-russian-bridge-2024-9\">Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range</a>, which has a reported range of 50 miles, and the AIM-120, a medium-range air-launched missile that takes out other aviation targets. Ukraine has both weapons.</p><p>This capability means the F-16 can be a versatile tool for fighting other aircraft, conducting ground strikes, or suppressing Russian air defenses.</p><p>Some of its Soviet aircraft, such as the MiG-29, are also multirole fighters, but the F-16 has better radar systems, electronic jammers, and range. In January, Ukraine said one of its pilots destroyed a record of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-f16-pilot-took-out-six-cruise-missiles-russia-attack-2025-1\">six Russian missiles</a> in a single sortie.</p><p>Dassault&#39;s Mirage is another combat-proven aircraft being sent to Ukraine, though it&#39;s generally limited to firing French munitions. For example, it can launch the long-range <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-mirage-jets-offer-new-way-fire-storm-shadow-2024-10\">Storm Shadow cruise missile</a> but has to stick with the shorter-range MICA air-to-air missile when dealing with aerial targets.</p><p>Kyiv has been receiving F-16s from European allies since the summer of last year and got its first tranche of Mirages from France in February.</p><p>Ukraine has been tight-lipped about the number of jets it&#39;s received. Countries including Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark have pledged to deliver more than 100 F-16s to Ukraine, but the entire process can take months to years.</p><p>Still, Ukraine has to be careful with its valuable Western jets. Russia&#39;s surface-to-air missile defenses, such as the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-s-400-formidable-not-quite-up-to-the-hype-2024-5\">S-400</a>, are formidable, and Ukrainian pilots have been known to limit flying altitude or range to lower exposure to them.</p><p>Kyiv has already <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-suffered-f-16-loss-jet-crashed-killed-pilot-2024-8\">lost one F-16</a> when a top pilot crashed in August while fighting cruise missiles and drones near the capital.</p><p>Earlier this month, several pro-Kremlin Telegram channels said another F-16 was shot down in the Sumy region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the report when speaking to journalists on March 19.</p><p>&#34;The Russians are lying that they shot down something there; they didn&#39;t shoot down anything,&#34; he said.</p><p>Zelenskyy has said Ukraine needs <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-faces-same-problem-with-f16s-as-abrams-tanks-zelenskyy-2024-7\">128 F-16s </a>to fight effectively against Russia.</p><p>Recently, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-putting-ukraine-f16-fleet-risk-europe-difficult-replace-russia-2025-3\">Ukraine&#39;s F-16 program was thrown into question</a> when President Donald Trump paused military aid to Kyiv in early March.

    "description": "She’s a Grand Prix champion, a triple Axel pioneer and one of figure skating’s most formidable athletes. But her artistry, not just her athleticism, may be what changes the sport When Amber Glenn takes the ice for the free skate on Friday night at the world figure skating championships in Boston after a disappointing short program , fans will be holding their breath. Undefeated this season, she was seen as the one to beat. The Grand Prix final Champion , two-time US champion , the only woman to regularly land a triple Axel in competition (on which she suffered an uncharacteristic fall, landing her ninth place in the short on Wednesday afternoon), she had been tipped to become the first US woman to win the world title in nearly 20 years. But with less than seven points between her and first place, nothing is impossible. And while much of the tenacity that could still bring her victory this week lies in her raw athleticism, Glenn has something in her arsenal more tenuous, and more volatile: She’s an artist. At first glance, Glenn doesn’t appear so different to the all-American skating stars of past decades. Slender, with blonde curled hair framing her perfectly made up face, she doesn’t overtly break the mold. But when the music starts, something else takes over. She’s explosive; her movements deliberate, and there’s a weight to her actions that not only enables her to drive across the ice like a hockey player, but to display exquisite musicality, showcasing a sensitivity and showmanship that has gained her a devoted fanbase (and 1.5m TikTok followers ).

The decision to remove the 23-year-old, not the first time Red Bull have acted with such emphatic purpose towards an underperforming driver, was blunt even by the team’s previous standards and an indication that they demand the capability to compete for the Formula One constructors’ championship as a priority.

    "description": "On 19 November 1969, the Brazil legend sparked wild celebrations with the 1,000th goal of his career – but it may have been scored five days earlier It was 14 November 1969. For the world’s greatest player, it wasn’t the best penalty. More an untidy scuff into the bottom corner. But it was enough for Pelé and his Santos team to open the scoring in a 3-0 friendly win over lowly Botafogo da Paraiba. More importantly, it marked the great man’s 999th senior goal. Or did it? Five days later, Santos travelled to Rio de Janeiro to face Vasco da Gama in a cup game and it seemed as if the entire nation was jammed into the cavernous Maracanã to witness a piece of football history. Despite a tropical rainstorm, every TV station, radio network and newspaper elbowed their way along the touchline waiting for the magic moment to happen. Continue reading...",

The preening, chiseled, British two-weight world champion thrived in front of a partisan crowd, soaking in the adoration or – usually – hatred with haughty disdain. His ring walk in Berlin before fighting Graciano Rocchigiani in 1994 is a classic of the genre , finished as ever with a vault over the top rope. Continue reading...",

For Liverpool supporters it seems likely the next month will bring a wildly varying emotional register. Departures and farewells. Winning the league in front of actual non-quarantined humans. The sense, even through the veil of commemorative red smoke, that the team that got you here are finally starting to become something else. Spring is always a time of reckoning up in football, April the cruellest month, all new shoots and final blooms, memories and desires, cheers but also sometimes jeers. So&nbsp;yeah.

Recovery Starts With Us, a public awareness campaign, is one of three Indy Arts Council initiatives that aims to address the prevalence of addiction and substance use disorder in Marion County, Indiana. Photo by The Basement The number of deaths from opioid overdoses in the U.S. increased tenfold from 1999 to 2022, with certain states experiencing higher overdose mortality rates. Indiana ranks in the top 15, and it is in the top 10 states for opioid prescriptions. The Indy Arts Council responded to the prevalence of addiction and substance use disorder in its community with three initiatives, all of which were funded in part by the city of Indianapolis’ opioid litigation settlement, secured through lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. One of these initiatives is Arts for Awareness, which began by funding projects that use arts-based activities that aim to prevent or build awareness of substance abuse in Marion County, of which Indianapolis is the county seat. In July 2024, Indy Arts Council announced the first four Arts for Awareness grant recipients: one artist, two arts organizations, and one residential recovery center. Projects could be conducted by nonprofits or individual artists, but they require that artists and addiction and substance abuse experts collaborate. In fall 2024, it was announced the Arts for Awareness program was one of nine arts and health projects that would receive a non-matching $150,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to expand its work beyond grantmaking. &nbsp; Funds from the Arts Endowment will allow the Indy Arts Council to contract with arts organizations which will collaborate with substance abuse experts to develop arts-based projects that aim to prevent and/or create awareness around addiction. They will also convene an advisory group, which will include the City of Indianapolis’s Office of Public Health and Safety and the Marion County Public Health Department, to ensure that the projects are following evidence-based practices. Together the advisory group and participating Arts for Awareness partners will come together for four discussion-based, in-person convenings to share knowledge, enhance ongoing work, and provide case studies for others to use when designing similar programs. As a local arts agency, the Indy Arts Council is uniquely positioned to bring together government entities with the arts community to address public health concerns. “Because substance use disorder has been such a prevalent issue in Indiana and Indianapolis, I think we are primed to try different things and try new things and create these partnerships,” said Nikki Kirk, Indy Arts Council’s director of community impact and strategic investment. “[Indy Arts Council is] in a really good position to bridge the gap between artists and arts organizations’ work and city officials and health departments’ work to really build cohesion for this type of programming.” Indy Arts Council's \"Recovery Starts with Us\" Campaign. Original artwork by Scott Johnson Dove Recovery House for Women, one of the first Arts for Awareness grantees, is the largest residential recovery center for women suffering from substance abuse in the state of Indiana. They are using their Arts for Awareness grant to integrate music therapy and art groups into their existing treatments. Women in the program will have the opportunity to share artwork or music developed during their sessions with the community in order to change the narrative through sharing real stories around substance abuse and those who suffer from it. Research, including that supported by the NEA, has found that the arts benefit people’s health—physical, cognitive, social, and emotional—and can specifically assist with the treatment and substance abuse prevention. Kirk said Indy Arts Council has benefited from public health and city officials embracing the arts role in this arena. “What they recognize is that these creative activities are really essential to supporting overall wellness, especially as it relates to mental health issues,” she said. In addition to ensuring the interventions used by grantees are backed by the healthcare community, Kirk said they are also using data to ensure these projects are reaching those who need it most. “When we come into this programming, we're making sure that we are identifying those that are most impacted by this disease, utilizing those target audiences and the data from our health departments and from our coroner's office to really make sure that this is reaching the people that it needs to reach.” “[Substance abuse] is a city epidemic. It's a state epidemic. It's a national epidemic,” she said. “So it's something that we all have to walk into together. To make sure that everybody's voice is at the table, heard, and represented is really important. We're making sure to base everything in the data that we are receiving from our health partners and in the expertise that we have from our artists and arts organizations—what their programming and impact looks like directly—to make sure that this is a really true and fruitful partnership.” Artistic Field Local Arts Agencies Blog Tag Grants Teaser Text A look at how Indy Arts Council is combatting substance abuse with the help of the arts.

(Faiga) , 1994, part of Muriel Hasbun’s Saints and Shadows series. PHOTO © MURIEL HASBUN Photography has the ability to freeze a fleeting moment, visually fixing a particular place and time in a single, immutable frame. Photographer Muriel Hasbun, on the other hand, has managed to expand her art form in such a way that her pieces move beyond mere moments, instead encapsulating entire family histories, diasporas, and cultural movements. Hasbun uses her work to explore her family’s unusual lineage and the tensions of her native El Salvador, often mixing historic photographs with multiple exposures to evoke the many layers of her personal story.&nbsp; Hasbun, a former Fulbright Scholar whose work has been exhibited around the world, spoke with the National Endowment for the Arts back in 2013 on how inspiration figures into her career. Today, we're revisiting her reflections to offer you five bits of wisdom on the different ways of looking at inspiration.&nbsp; Work hard: \"I think that bodies of work, or some sort of insight, usually come because you’ve been toiling away for a long time, and consistently. It’s a process of figuring out what your sources are, figuring out what it is that you’re trying to say—a lot of play and a lot of work.\" Be patient: \"I work over time. Nothing comes quickly. It seems that my process is one where I’m collecting these different little hints that I get as I progress.\" Pay attention: \"It's a combination of being open, being alert to those particular things that you’re doing and that you’re paying attention to, how it is that you’re making things, and then connecting them. In that connection, something that you never imagined comes about.\" Look within: \"Finding the subject of what the artwork will be is perhaps the hardest thing for an artist to figure out. It really entails getting to know oneself.\" Experiment: \"There was this whole issue of who am I to different people, and how is it that I can reconcile what it means to be Jewish and Arab and Latina and having grown up in El Salvador and being trilingual. My work became the place where I started to experiment and answer those questions.\" Part of Muriel Hasbun's exhibition Documented: The Community Blackboard at the Art Museum of the Americas in 2006.

    "description": "NEA Tech Check: Archival Producers Alliance Date Fri, 03/07/2025 - 12:00 Paulette Beete Thu, 03/06/2025 - 19:58 Author By Jax Deluca Teaser Image archivalproducersalliance.png Body This NEA interview series takes you on a journey across the nation to learn how leaders in the arts and cultural field are approaching the intersections of technology, culture, and society. Inspired by findings from the NEA arts and technology field scan conducted in partnership with Knight Foundation and Ford Foundation, we aim to increase public awareness of creative approaches to technology that engage local communities, explore ethical issues, and increase digital skills through the arts. Here is our conversation with Stephanie Jenkins of Archival Producers Alliance. (l-r) Jennifer Petrucelli, Rachel Antell, and Stephanie Jenkins of Archival Producers Alliance. Photo courtesy of APA NEA: Tell us about your organization. STEPHANIE JENKINS: We founded the&nbsp; Archival Producers Alliance &nbsp;(APA) in 2023 to provide a way for our field to come together, share collective knowledge, and to influence policy and effect change within the industry.&nbsp;The organization now includes hundreds of experienced producers and researchers across the country as well as internationally. Archival producers have a unique role in the film industry, as they interface with many levels of production as well as many vendors outside of the production team. An archival producer researches, sources, and manages archival material including footage, photographs, audio, text, and ephemera for use in documentary films and series, feature films, museum exhibits, commercials, and more. This process may involve research online as well as on-site at various archives, including academic, commercial, and personal collections. Specifics of an archival producer’s workflow can vary greatly, but always involve professional archival record-keeping and expertise in using search engines, finding aids, and databases. Archival producers, working in concert with a film’s director, producer, and editor, are an integral part of the story-telling team. They source unique and often never-before-seen materials that can drive the narrative and aesthetics of a project; work to verify the veracity and accuracy of primary source materials; and organize and manage archival assets to ease the editing and rights and clearances processes. NEA: Tell us about a specific program you are involved in that supports artist-driven explorations of technology. JENKINS: Our first initiative was to write and publish \"Best Practices of GenAI in Documentaries,\" the first industry-wide standard within the field to address ethics of this emerging technology. The guidelines seek to reaffirm the journalistic values that the documentary community has long held. A guiding principle of our craft has been documentary film’s implicit promise to the audience that what is presented as real is in fact real—even though that reality will, no doubt, have a point of view. We believe there is inherent worth in preserving the fact-based nature of documentary so that it will continue to be a trusted cultural resource. Further, we contend that human creativity holds unique value, and that the act of humans “bearing witness” is an integral part of the documentary genre. The APA acknowledges and welcomes many of the opportunities that Machine Learning and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) bring to filmmaking—and also realizes that this new technology comes with risks that need to be addressed. NEA: Was there a specific interest or experience that led you to including technology in your work? JENKINS: As archival producers, we spend our time researching and verifying historical audiovisual material. In the spring of 2023, we started seeing synthetic “historic” images and audio being brought into documentary productions. The images were extremely realistic and indistinguishable from actual historic images that we were bringing into projects. At that time, it was unclear to filmmakers whether they needed to be transparent about their use of the generative AI; there wasn’t any precedent so it was really the Wild West. This raised big questions and concerns for us about how documentary film would maintain the trust it has established with audiences, as well as its commitment to historical truth. So we gathered a group of archival producers and began meeting regularly to better understand how GenAI worked and how it might impact our projects as well as the historical record. The result was the creation of “ Best Practices for the Use of Generative AI in Documentaries .”&nbsp; NEA: What are some of the ways in which you have experienced arts and technology activities contributing to the wellbeing of individuals and communities? JENKINS: There are many good examples of documentary filmmakers using Generative AI to positively impact the communal well-being. A shining example of this is the work of Reuben Hamlyn and Sophie Compton, directors of&nbsp; Another Body. &nbsp;Their documentary uses GenAI with great intentionality to protect the identities of their participants, who were victims of deepfake pornography. We also want to shout out David France who similarly used GenAI to great effect in his documentary&nbsp; Welcome to Chechnya . NEA: What are ways the arts and cultural field can play a role in building the future with technology? &nbsp; JENKINS: We encourage arts organizations to take a breath when approaching emerging technology—and center their&nbsp; existing &nbsp;experience and standards when considering how to engage. We had success in drafting our Best Practices because we centered our conversations within a framework of broadly ethical standards and documentary history—and we encourage others to approach AI in much the same way. As we began writing our Best Practices, we knew that questions raised by Generative AI were on a continuum with other discussions that have been happening in documentary film for as long as people have been making documentaries. This includes ever-evolving topics such as re-creations, as well as issues around subjectivity and bias. We asked ourselves: “What makes a documentary? Why are we attached to the things we’re attached to? What are the values that the community holds across the board, if there are any?” With these in mind, we asked ourselves where GenAI fits into these topics. What emerged from these conversations was not only a written document, but a community! We wrote collaboratively with fifteen people in weekly meetings over the course of two months. Everyone pushed themselves to write and hone and clarify ideas. Through that, we also formed a tight bond. We hope that this method can provide a model to other arts organizations. NEA:&nbsp;Has technology always been a core interest to your work or practice? Is there a specific experience or cross-sector arts and technology collaboration(s) that was largely influential? JENKINS: Since we started our work looking at GenAI, others in the documentary field have been wondering why are&nbsp;archival producers&nbsp;talking about AI? As archival producers, we spend a lot of time researching and tracking down historical audiovisual material. Most of us are happiest in dusty archives and looking through old newspapers, not thinking about Large Language Models! A key part of our job, however, is confirming the veracity of primary sources. Once we saw that veracity itself could be questioned when “historical-looking” GenAI elements, which can be indistinguishable from primary sources, moved into documentaries, we knew we needed to stake a claim. Doing this work has embedded us even deeper into our passion for primary sources and given us tools to understand why they are so essential for documentary storytelling. It also has pushed us to question assumptions about what the nature of “truth” even is. NEA:&nbsp;How can small or mid-sized arts organizations get involved with this work, if coming to it for the first time? Why should they not feel intimidated, and how can they explore these tools/activities even on a modest budget or with more limited resources? JENKINS: We believe that any assessment of a new technology should come from&nbsp; within &nbsp;the community that will be impacted by it. GenAI tools were not developed by artists or arts organizations— nor was their creation guided by their needs, values, or best interests. Decisions on how or if to use them need to come from the people who have put years into building the field. You should never feel you need to be a tech expert to decide if or how you will use the technology. AI does not move at a human pace, but it is ok that we do. It is important to remember that we are all experts of our own jobs and our own lives—and can speak with authority on those. When our core values are at the center of the discussion, they can provide a lens through which to assess how or if to engage with the technology. NEA: Please share some arts and technology-related tips, forums, online communities, or resources that you’d recommend for readers to check out. &nbsp; JENKINS: The extraordinary Starling Lab out of Stanford University has compiled a set of&nbsp; Standard Setting Bodies &nbsp;around AI policy. See if this can help! Knowing Machines does a fantastic job of compiling essential information about Generative AI in a very crowded media environment. We suggest reading their Synthetic Media Media and Generative AI Legal Explainer. For excellent and transparent uses of GenAI technology, we suggest watching&nbsp; Another Body &nbsp;and&nbsp; Welcome to Chechnya. &nbsp;Rachel Antell, Stephanie Jenkins and Jennifer Petrucelli are co-directors and co-founders of the Archival Producers Alliance.

    "description": "Shake It Up: The Benefits of Free-Form Dance May Rival Those of Other Forms of Movement Date Thu, 03/06/2025 - 12:00 Paulette Beete Wed, 03/05/2025 - 22:15 Author By Sunil Iyengar Teaser Image Measure for Measure doodles v.2a (1).jpg Body When we talk about the arts and DIY, we commonly refer to craft activities or teaching oneself how to play a musical instrument. But what could be more DIY than free-form dancing? The adjective says it all. Free-form, freestyle, or free dance is a series of unstructured, personally directed movements in which creativity and improvisation are at a premium. In a recent article based on Arts Endowment-supported research, Northeastern University’s Aston McCullough asserts that free-form dancing&nbsp;should become more widely known as a healthy physical activity. To most people, after all, the option is instantly available. The starting-point for McCullough’s article—which appeared last November in PLOS One —is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans . The guidelines state that adults should do at least two-and-a-half hours of “moderate-intensity” physical activity per week. However, the guidelines also say that physical activity bouts “of any length” can contribute to health benefits, provided that the activity is of “moderate-to-vigorous” intensity. &nbsp; If this is true, then it should be possible by dancing however one would like—even on a sporadic basis—to attain levels of physical activity conducive to health gains. But how do we know that self-determined regimens of free-form dance can meet this threshold? Enter Dr. McCullough. In a small, pilot study, 48 adults between 18 and 85 years old were asked to “dance in their usual fashion” with and without music they had pre-selected. These bouts occurred for five minutes each. Twice, the subjects were asked to dance to an intensity they perceived as “moderate,” and twice to an intensity they perceived as “vigorous.” The bouts were separated by a three-minute rest period. &nbsp; The adults took lab tests before the session, and, while dancing, each wore a calorimeter and a heart monitor. It turns out that most participants were excellent judges of their physical activity levels: when asked to dance solo to a “moderate” intensity—with or without music—all managed to reach moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, as measured by percent of heart rate reserve (HRR) or metabolic equivalents (METs) used. &nbsp; When asked to dance at “vigorous” intensity, with music, 92 percent of subjects engaged in vigorous physical activity as measured by percent of HRR. Without music, it was 94 percent. In terms of METs, more than 80 percent of dancers to music rated vigorous physical activity, compared with 58 percent of those who danced without music. &nbsp; At the group level, too, “ a self-determined moderate or vigorous intensity was sufficient for eliciting a moderate-to-vigorous [physical activity] intensity,” McCullough writes. Indeed, “some participants tended to perceive they were dancing at lower intensities than were otherwise observed” via oxygen uptake or heart rate responses, he notes. Overall, preliminary evidence shows that, at the group level, absolute physical-activity levels “elicited during self-determined moderate intensity solo, free-form dance bouts are of a similar intensity to those reported for ballroom dancing with a partner, ballet barre sequences, modern dance classes and performances, and other modes of [physical activity, or PA] like bicycling at 9.4 mph or walking backwards at 3.5 mph,” the article concludes. Moreover, no dance-specific training is required, McCullough adds. “Free-form dancing is immediately accessible to most everyone, and it is a [physical activity] mode that is unhampered by PA barriers such as neighborhood walkability.” I might just stop here to wriggle around in my cubicle.

    "description": "Terence Blanchard: A Life in Music—Part Two Download Audio Transcript Music Credits: “NY” composed and performed by Kosta T, from the cd Soul Sand . Used courtesy of the Free Music Archive. Terence Blanchard, Live at Monterey Jazz Festival, 2023. “The Water” from the album A Tale of God’s Will (a requiem for Hurricane Katrina). Composed and performed by Terence Blanchard. “I Dare You” from the album Absence Composed by Terence Blanchard, performed by the Turtle Island Quartet. “Peculiar Grace” from the opera, Fire Shut Up In my Bones . Music composed by Terence Blanchard, libretto by Kasi Lemmons, sung by Angel Blue, Metropolitan Opera, 09/27/2021. Jo Reed: From the National Endowment for the Arts, this is Art Works I’m Josephine Reed. This is part two of my 2023 conversation with NEA Jazz Master Terence Blanchard. In our last episode, we explored his early years in New Orleans, his time with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, and his evolution as a composer and bandleader. Today, we continue the conversation by looking at the many ways Terence has expanded his artistry—with his groups, through opera, and his role as artistic director of SFJAZZ. We’ll talk about his album Absence dedicated to NEA Jazz Master Wayne Shorter, and how composing for opera pushed him into new creative territory. We’ll also explore his passion for music education and the ways he’s helped shape the next generation of jazz musicians. But first, we turn to one of the most defining moments of his life both personally and artistically—Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the United States killing over 1,800 people and devastating much of New Orleans. Katrina and its aftermath became the subject of Spike Lee’s four-part documentary, When the Levees Broke , which was scored by Terence. Terence was living in LA [Los Angeles] as well as New Orleans and brought his family, including his mother, to California before the hurricane hit. Their return to New Orleans became a part of the documentary. Terence Blanchard: When we did When the Levees Broke , man, it was tough. It was tough for a lot of reasons. We were living uptown at the time, and the house that we had there, we didn't have water damage. We had broken windows because of the wind, and got all of that repaired. But what was crazy about that was when I worked on 4 Little Girls and the visuals of that and the storyline, when it would get too heavy for me, I would take a break and I would come down and hang out or go to the park, go bike riding or whatever. I couldn't do that when the levies broke, because I was really stepping right into what it was I was looking at in my studio. So that was a rough time. And then to go through the thing of taking my mom back to the house was probably one of the hardest things I had to do other than bury my father, because she was holding out hope that nothing had happened to the house, and I had already been to the house. I went the night before just on my own, and I saw the devastation, and I couldn't say anything to her. I had to let her experience it herself.&nbsp; It was rough. That was hard. Spike didn't even come in. He stayed outside. It was hard for everybody that was there. We worked together, but we're family. You know what I mean? And they're seeing my house that I grew up in destroyed. But then when I started to see the documentary, I was totally amazed at what Spike put together. Initially, it was supposed to be a two-hour documentary, two hours, but there was so much information, we couldn't leave it there. We just had to expand it. But our budget stayed at a two-hour budget. So basically, we all worked for free at a certain point, but we were all committed to it. And I told Spike this, and it's probably one of the most comprehensive things I've ever seen done on this area, because there's so many different cultures and facets here. He had all of those things combined in this one piece. And that's the way that I tried to approach it in scoring it. But the most important thing was I was just thankful for him to do it. Jo Reed: But then you also came out with the album A Tale of God's Will: A Requiem for Katrina building on some of the themes you used in When The Levees Broke . Terence Blanchard: Yes. Jo Reed: Tell me about the story that you felt like you wanted to tell with that album. Terence Blanchard: Well, it was more that I couldn't get past the whole notion of what had happened to my city. Just seeing all that type of stuff in your hometown, it's something you never imagine, you never want to see again. But then it just frustrates you. And while I appreciated what Spike had done, I felt like I needed to make my own statement about it. And we started working on it, and the guys were creating their tunes and arrangements, and there was so much magic that was happening. It was crazy. I don't know who said it first, and I can't remember, but one of us started chanting, “this is a tale of God's will.” It just came out nowhere. We didn't have a title for the album at all. And once that started to happen, man, everything just started to fall into place for that album. And when we released that album, people were telling us how the music had affected them and how it helped them get through the grieving process. Jo Reed: And A Tale of God's Will was the first Grammy you won as a leader. Terence Blanchard: Yeah, it was interesting, the Tale of God . It was interesting because A Tale of God's Will was the first Grammy that I'd ever won in my life as a leader. And it was powerful. It just meant a lot because we didn't create the album for that. You know what I mean? But being recognized still meant a lot. So it was a powerful moment in time, for sure. Jo Reed: And you addressed the impact of Katrina through your role as an educator….The Monk Institute is a multi-faceted organization dedicated to music education and you were instrumental in bringing the institute to New Orleans. Terence Blanchard: Yeah. When I worked with The Monk Institute, I loved all of the work that we would do in the high schools. Granted, I love working with the students themselves. They were semi-pro soon to be pro musicians. But I was really excited about sending those guys out into the high schools and middle schools. So when we talked about bringing it to New Orleans, that meant a lot to me because I knew at that time that there were kids that were suffering, struggling here. When you go through something that's traumatic like that, I went through Hurricane Betsy as a kid. I remember stepping off of my porch being picked up. I was about four years old being picked up and put into a boat. And (we) couldn't find my dad for a couple of days, and we were staying in somebody's front room of a house sleeping on the floor. So come on, I'm four years old and I still have that's stuck in my head. So I knew that there were kids here that were in dire straits, right? And I also knew that music could probably be one of the things to help them. So that's why I wanted the Monk Institute to come to New Orleans. And sure enough, when we started sending our kids out into the high schools and the middle schools, they started to help a lot of kids here. That's what my life turned around in terms of why I create music. When you see the power in it and how it can help people deal with these tough topics like this, you start to feel a responsibility to address these things, because all of my mentors are gone. You look around and you go, well, who else is here but us? So we need to address this stuff. Jo Reed: But of course, you more than anyone are capable of doing more than one thing simultaneously. And the album Absence is your love letter to Wayne Shorter, it features your group E-Collective and The Turtle Island Quartet and I think it needs some flowers in this conversation. Terence Blanchard: No, thank you for saying that. Man, I love Wayne Shorter so much that I had to do something to let him know that before he passed, and the thing about doing an album for Wayne, which is the way him and Herbie both are, they don't want you to just do their tunes. No. What do you see? How do you see it? How do you perceive it? What's your idea? You know what I mean? So we did a mixture of some of his tunes and some originals. And man, we got a chance to go and hang out with Wayne before we recorded. Now, I had been around Wayne a number of times. Obviously I've been on him for a long time. But some of the guys in the group, it was their first time being around him. And Wayne is the type of dude, he just gives you a life lesson of just a general conversation. And I'll never forget when we left the house, we were standing outside the house. We hadn't gone anywhere. And the guys were like, \"Thank you, man. Thank you for this. Thank you, thank you.\" Jo Reed: You talk about life lessons. Please, please convey the one where he said to you, “It takes courage to be happy.” Because I read that, and that was a life lesson for me. Like fourth hand. Terence Blanchard: Right? Yeah. Well, I was playing at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. Jazz and Heritage Festival, and Wayne was there. And just in typical fashion, I don't even know how the subject came up, he starts to tell me about some violinist who never would win an audition for an orchestra, because she played real aggressive, and her style didn't mix with other string players. And she had gotten to the point of having so much rejection that she was at a low point in her life, almost at a point where she wanted to commit suicide. And her mother called her, and just like any mom could hear something was wrong with her child, and her child wouldn't say anything. And then the mom goes, “Well, it takes courage to be happy.” And when Wayne told me that story, man, I had been trying to, the best way I can explain it is that I was trying to live up to an image that wasn't real. It wasn't me. It was what I thought a jazz musician should be, right? And man, when he said that, it was like something was lifted off to my shoulders. And I went, \"Oh, Right. It takes courage to be happy.\" It brought me back to something that a great musician in New Orleans, Alvin Baptiste, said to me, he said, \"Man, the easiest thing to do is to learn how to play like John Coltrane.\" He says, \"Because everybody loves John Coltrane.\" He said, \"The hardest thing to do is to be yourself. But that's what being an artist really is.\" So when Wayne told me that story, my mind went right back to that, and I went, right, okay. So now the question becomes, so then who am I really? Who am I really? I had been already moving down that road, but I was trying to fit it within an aesthetic. And when Wayne told me that the walls came tumbling down, everything became a possibility for me then. Jo Reed: The composition you wrote for the album Absence is “I Dare You.” And that's an important title, a very significant one. Terence Blanchard: Yeah, it's a very important title for a number of reasons, because the tune itself, it's a tune that I'd written to prove a point to my students about. You can make a tune out of two notes. (Terence scats) Jo Reed: I kept thinking of Beethoven's Fifth . Terence Blanchard: Okay, well, okay, okay. Right. Okay. So what's funny about that is that when I introduced it to the audience, we play a stretch of tunes, and I try to remind 'em of what they heard. And I said, \"Do you remember that kind of funky Beethoven us thing that we start with?\" I said, \"That's one of my tunes.\" And what's crazy about that to me is because that the introduction was written the morning of the day, we recorded that introduction was written the morning of the day. We recorded the tune because I noticed we didn't have anything for, I said, \"I woke up early one morning.\" I said, \"We need something for this beginning of the tune.\" So I wrote that string introduction that morning and brought it in. And the title comes from something that Wayne said when he was asked by Tavis Smiley, what does jazz mean? And Wayne said, “Jazz means I dare you.” And it was another one of those life lessons you say, I dare you. And I'm like, \"See, that's what I'm talking about. It takes courage to be happy. I dare you.\" You know what I mean? And it's one of those things where in the Buddhist philosophy is like to fight, to fight for your potential. To keep moving ahead. Wayne was a prime example of that. So it's kind of how I'm trying to live my life through his examples. Jo Reed: What led to you composing opera? Were you fulfilling this suppressed longing? Terence Blanchard: Oh, man. No way. No way. When it came to writing opera, that was not something that was even on the plate whatsoever. I always tell a joke, when Jim Robinson came and asked me, he said, we want you to write an opera. I kind of leaned across the table to smell his breath. I'm like, is this dude drunk? What's going on, man? You want me to write an opera? That's some of the funniest stuff I've ever heard. But I got to tell you though, I'm always up for a challenge. So I called Roger Dickerson again, \"Roger, they want me to do this.\" Boom. And once I started, it was, man, it was such a journey because I didn't know what I was doing, but I kept saying to myself, just write what feels right. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, you still have another career. Jo Reed: And Jim Robinson was artistic director of Opera Theatre of St Louis? Terence Blanchard: Yes. And opera theater, St. Louis man, they were amazing. They really stepped me through the process. You work workshopping it, dealing with the voices, understanding when music should be turned in, understanding how to do a piano vocal score so we could rehearse. And then finally getting down to the final thing, man, it was a process, but the payoff is so incredible. I can't explain it to you. You sit in a room, you sit at a piano by yourself for two years crafting this story, and you kind of see images in your mind. But then all of a sudden, there are people who are singing these lines like sound familiar to you. And they're walking around the stage, and all of a sudden now they have costumes on and there's lighting. It blows my mind. So I've been telling people recently, \"I'm looking forward to doing my third opera now,\" but probably when I'm in the middle of it, I'm going to be like, \"Man, what the hell was I thinking?\" Jo Reed: Well, your first opera was Champion based on the life of Emil Griffith who was a boxer and he was gay. What attracted you to that story? Terence Blanchard: I found out about Emil Griffith from my best friend, and he knows I'm a fight fan. And he had talked to me about Emile Griffith, and he told me about the book Nine, Ten and Out . So I think the thing that got me about Emile's story, I thought about the time that I won my first Grammy They called my name. I turned to my wife without thinking, give her a kiss and a hug, and I go up and receive my award. And I'm thinking, this guy became welterweight champion of the world and could never really celebrate that openly with anybody that he loved. Makes no sense to me. And what was beautiful about doing it with opera theater St. Louis, is that in order to promote the opera, we did a lot of civic stuff. I went to a lot of organizations, spoke to them, the gay and lesbian community, the sport in the sports world. We had panel discussions. We did a lot of stuff. And it brought everybody out in St. Louis to experience it. People from the health community that deal with dementia, they were there. And everybody was just thankful that there was something that treated these topics with dignity and allowed us to talk about. So that, again, was a powerful thing for me. But the most important thing was I got hooked. I hate to say it, I hate to say it, Jim, but I got hooked. You know what I mean? I don't consider myself an opera composer, and they keep telling me, \"Dude, you're an opera composer. Get over it.\" I am hooked on how it all comes together. My favorite part is when we get into the theater in rehearsal and you see it and you can kind of understand what's going on, but they don't have the wardrobe yet lighting. And when you get into the theater and the lights and the, oh my God, and it just starts to come, and then it really doesn't really pop until that performance, the premiere. There's something that happens to those guys when that curtain goes up, boom. They click into another world, man with all of a sudden everything just gets raised up a notch, and it's an amazing experience to have in your life.&nbsp; Jo Reed: I have to think that all your experience in scoring films really helped you when it came for you to sit down with an opera. Terence Blanchard: My experience in the film world helped me tremendously in the operatic world because I wasn't so concerned about writing for orchestra. I had that under my belt, and creating sonic colors for certain situations was fine. The problem was writing for voice. And the most problematic part is different from singing to singing. They can all be sopranos, but they're different. Sopranos all be baritones and all be different. So that part was the part that took some time to learn. But when you learn that for a specific singer, oh man, it turns everything around. Just knowing, knowing the abilities of the singers to be able to do those things, that's when the storytelling process really becomes a big deal. I'm a big Puccini fan, and the thing that I love about Puccini is that I love how the melody line develops with the story. They're intertwined, and that's what I've been trying to do. I also try to make the musical lines feel natural. So I would spend a lot of time, I would spend a lot of time reading the libretto out loud, and when I would read the libretto out loud, I would hear the rhythms and what it was that I was reading, and I would write that under the libretto. One of the other things that I had to learn about the human voice is that being a trumpet player, to hit those high notes, we have to hit those on demand. Right? Well, with singers, they can do that, but a lot of times they want to run up to the note. So you have to take that into consideration when you're writing, especially if you want it to be big at a certain point of the storyline. All those things play a factor in how you develop your melody lines. Jo Reed: Well, Champion was very well received, and then comes opera number two. Fire Shut Up in My Bones based on the memoir by Charles Blow. So what is the origin story for that particular opera? Terence Blanchard: My wife knew of the book F ire Shut Up in My Bones and asked me to read it. I was floored by a few things in the book. First I, I'm a big fan of Charles Blow, loved his writing, loved him as a commentator. Still think he's probably one of the smartest people out there. But then you read the book and you go, man, he's from Gibbon, Louisiana. Oh man. And then you find out that he was molested as a kid, and you go, wow, that was unfortunate. But then you look at his life and you go, but that dude came through that in a way that's so impressive. We have to do this story. Jo Reed: Fire In My Bones opened in 2019 at the Opera Theater of St. Louis, and then you get a phone call from the Metropolitan Opera. Terence Blanchard: Yeah, I get a phone call from a friend of mine named Peter Gelb, and he goes, “Hey man, we want to do your opera at the Met”. And I went, \"Excuse me.\" You have to remember, I never really saddled up for this musical journey in my life. So while this is all taken off this, it's kind of unreal for me in a sense. Then all of a sudden now, the production has gone from being this one little thing to being this huge production at The Met. I remember walking into the rehearsal for the first day, and it was about 50 singers in the room, and I went, \"Whoa.\" And I'm the only dude in there that couldn't sing. You know what I mean? It was like, oh, man. But the beautiful thing about it was everybody was on the same page as to the purpose, the importance of it. We had a round table discussion the first day of rehearsal, and there was a lot of tears, a lot of tears, people saying things like, this is the first role they've ever done that they can relate to. One of the young kids said it gave him hope because he was bullied at school because he wanted to be an opera singer, but he felt safe in our community. He was around so many people like him. I knew this, but it didn't really click until I had a conversation with the late Arthur Woodley, who was a great baritone, and we were talking about how a lot of African American singers grew up in a church or sang R&amp;B or jazz, and they were told to turn all of that off to sing opera. And then it hit me that day of that first day at a rehearsal where we had the round table. I'm like, wait a minute. This is a current story. This is an American story. So I told the singers, I said, listen, whatever your background is, bring all of that to this man in Angel Blue . She did it on this aria “Peculiar Grace”. She asked me, are you okay with me doing some things? I'm like, sure. Because she grew up in a church singing a church. Lemme tell you something. When she sang, I think in rehearsal, everybody was in tears. It was powerful. I think what she sang was beautiful. Don't get me wrong. But I think the reason why we were all in tears was because it was like we've been avoiding this for how long? But it made total sense, and it was who she was as a person who has a deep faith, and man that turned everything around, turned everything around for everybody&nbsp; Jo Reed: Fire Shut Up in My Bones opened the 2021–22 season at the Metropolitan Opera—the first opera staged there after the long Covid closure and it was first opera by a Black composer to be performed by the Met, ever. Which shocked the hell out of everybody so for you, it had to have been on one hand \"Oh my God, my opera is at the Met and like, oh my God, are you kidding me?\" Terence Blanchard: Oh, definitely. That was definitely it. I was like, I was at the Met. It was just incredible. And then I'm like, I forgot the journalist who called me, he said, \"How do you feel being the first African-American to have an opera at the Met?\" I'm like, \"What?\" I didn't believe him. I'm like, go back and check that. That can't be true. Then not only was it true, but then I'm doing an interview on television and they bring me a ledger of operas that were rejected and William Grant Still's name is in there three times. Three times. And I had just heard one of those operas the summer before in St. Louis and thought it was hip and amazing. Didn't know what it was. I'm like, well, man, what is this? And they said, oh, that's William Grant Still's Highway 1 . I went, man, that's kind of cool. I love that. So the thing that was so crazy about that period in my life, I kept telling people, man, okay, I'm the first African American to have an opera at the Met, but I'm not the first qualified African American to have an opera at the Met. Let's just be real about it. They were many other guys who were well qualified to have that moniker. So while I'm proud of it, but it comes with a mixed bag of emotions. Opera is the highest form of musical theater you could ever experience. That's the way I look at it, and I think with all of the talent out there, man, the possibilities are endless to create stories and tell stories that could be really intriguing to a fan base. Jo Reed: What was opening night like at the Met? What was the feeling like in that house, on the stage? Terence Blanchard: I was emotionally just blown away at the level of support that was shown to us. People came out dressed to the nines. It was incredible. And I had never been that nervous before in my life, because this is the Met. This thing could really bomb. But when those guys started to sing, I felt like I was in good hands, if that makes sense. I knew that they were stepping up to the plate. They understood what was at stake. Right. And like I said, everything went up a notch. Everything went up a notch. All the performances to such a degree where I felt weird coming out to take a bow at the end of it. You know what I mean? I just put some notes on the page, those people that went out there and performed and did it. But to see the response from the crowd, There were so many people who had never been to the Met before, never been to opera before, who came. They were excited about it. It was probably one of the most diverse audiences they've ever seen at the Met. And one of the things that we learned is that those first timers bought tickets to other shows. Jo Reed: You are passionate about education. Terence Blanchard: Yes. Jo Reed: You have a whole career as an educator. Talk about why this is central to your artistic life. Terence Blanchard: I am the beneficiary of great teachers and great programs as well. New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts, all of the summer programs that I went to at Loyola University. Without those things, I don't know where I would be. And I see now, excuse me, I see now how important they are because we don't have a situation where guys are learning on the streets. Some people are, but guys are coming to these bands well prepared because of these systems. The guys in my jazz band with Kendrick Scott and some of those guys, they all went to Arch High School. Those arch high schools really helped shape their careers and gave them strong musical foundations, which allowed them to go out and grow and prosper. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and there was talk of taking music out of the schools, I lost it. I'm like, who would ever think of such a thing? I remember they did a study and they found that kids who were involved in music did better in math and science, just in general. So just from a productive point of view, the arts really help us develop another side of our brain. And I'd like to think that it helps us to develop the compassionate side of us – that along with these experiences as musicians, allow us to create music to help people heal. But as patrons, it allows you to get from, like Art Blakely used to say, the doldrums of everyday life.— It allows you to enter into a world where you could put aside things that are bothering you, things that are troubling you just for a moment, which could help rejuvenate your soul to get back to doing the work that you need to do. So I think it's a win-win for everybody involved, because music education is not just about creating musicians, but it's about creating a community that really appreciates the arts, I think. And I've seen what it's done for me. I'm here to tell you arts education is vital. It's vital. People don't really get it sometimes because they keep looking at the big picture. They're not understanding that this is not necessarily about creating the next Wynton Marsalis. No, it's not about that. If we do that, fine, that'd be great. But it's about creating the next productive person who understands what art is and what life is about, much bigger than what they see on the block. We want to have a world mentality. And that's what having these broader experiences for young kids does. Did it for me. Did it for everybody that I grew up with. Jo Reed: I'm wondering when you're teaching students who are at the college level who are really thinking about a career in music, how do you help them develop their own style? Terence Blanchard: Right. Well, when I'm working with kids who really want to become professional musicians, I make 'em all compose – all of them. But here's the thing. I teach them composition the way Roger taught me. So it's not necessarily about the idea, but it's how we develop the idea. So when I give 'em all of these rules about how to take their idea and runthrough all of these various permutations, they see all of these possibilities. The cool thing is, is that none of them sound the same because I'm not giving them the idea. They're taking their own ideas, and I'm showing them how to take that idea no matter how small, and blow it up into something big. An example I always use is (scats the beginning of Beethoven’s Fifth ). Four notes and it became a huge symphony. Jo Reed: And you are now the artistic director at SFJazz. What attracted you to that role? Terence Blanchard: Well, the job at SF Jazz for me, was really attractive because it's San Francisco, first of all. And when you think about music and art in San Francisco, man, there's a lot of cutting edge stuff it that's come from that area. It's been an incubator. You know what I mean? For art, for creative things, for daring things. It's getting, the tech world is kind of taking it over now in terms of the impression of what's there. But no, man, it's always been this haven for the arch for me. And Randall Kline, who was the guy who created SF Jazz, I've known him for a number of years, man, for a long time. When I first met him, he was a concert promoter. And when I saw what he built with SFJ is, I thought it was brilliant, brilliant. Had no idea I'd be working there—running a joint. But now that I'm there, I'm excited about what it is we can do. Because I wanted to be a destination spot. I want people from all over the world to come to San Francisco and check out SFJazz. We are already well entrenched in the community, and there's more things that we could do in terms of outreach to students that I'm working on. We want to go more into the schools and some communities and have a bigger footprint in those areas. But along with that, I want to offer opportunities for musicians that are kind of caught in the middle of things. You got to understand that it's a different world from when I got into the music industry. When I got in, you got signed to the label, they promoted you on radio, you were hearing you all over the place, and you could tour. That's gone. It's gone. So we have to figure out how to help some of these musicians who are not major stars, but who are not beginners. They're kind of caught in the middle a little bit. And so some of us realize we have to take a chance on them to build a relationship with audiences, and that'll happen over time. That's the reason why It's a nonprofit organization. We don't have to turn a profit, even though we do, we do extremely well. But at the same time, I am really excited about all of that. There's some technological things we're going to do. We have immersive video there. I'm excited about how we're going to incorporate that into live shows. I actually want to curate a series of matching video artists with musicians and have them collaborate on things. There's so many things coming down the pipe with SFJazz. So when you talk about why I'm there, man, it's because the sky's the limit with that organization. And I was telling some people, I said, man, I really feel like I've been given the keys to a Ferrari with SFJazz, because it's already been doing a lot of great work. I'm just coming in there and just kind of putting my take on things and trying to expand it in other areas. Jo Reed: And you have been named an NEA Jazz Master. What does that mean for you, Terence? Terence Blanchard: Well, first of all, I was not expecting that at all—the NEA Jazz Master thing because I had seen so many people receive it. When it finally dawned on me and I realized that it was real, it took me a second. It's a huge honor. It's a huge honor to be in a class with all of my heroes. It's something I didn't think of that it just never crossed my mind. And even now just talking about it, now's like the realization of it. It's overwhelming to a degree, because I remember when it started, and I remember saying to myself, finally, that's kind of cool that these guys are being recognized like this in such a way because they've been contributing so much to the world of music. And now to be in that lineup, man, ask me when it's all after the thing is done. It is kind of like going to the Met for the first time. It's like I can't really put into words what it feels like because I'm still processing the entire thing. But to suffice it to say, it's a huge, huge overwhelming honor to be amongst some of the greatest of our time. Jo Reed: And an honor so well deserved. Terence, truly. Terence Blanchard: Thank you. Jo Reed: Thank you. Thank you for everything you do. Terence Blanchard: No, thank you. I appreciate you saying that. I do. I do. And NEA Jazz Master. Wow. Jo Reed: That was part two of my conversation with 2024 NEA Jazz Master Terence Blanchard. We spoke at the end of 2023. This is my last episode of Art Works. I am off to my retirement after 696 shows…and each one has been sheer pleasure. Art Works has been possible all these years because of the support from my colleagues at the Arts Endowment, most particularly those in the Office of Public Affairs, both past and present. So here’s to Adam Kampe, Jess Sarmiento, Jamie Bennett, Carlos Arrien, Rebecca Sutton, Kelli Rogowski, Liz Auclair, David Low, Sally Gifford, Paulette Beete, Carolyn Coons, Victoria Hutter, Sonia Tower, Aunye Boone, Cliff Archuletta, Allison Hill, and especially Don Ball.
