The consulate said four people had died, but did not specify if they were Russian, Reuters reported. Six people have died and nine others are injured after a tourist submarine sank in the popular Egyptian Red Sea destination of Hurghada, two municipal officials said. AP reported that the officials were speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media. The incident, involving a recreational vessel operated by Sindbad Submarines, occurred in waters opposite Hurghada’s Marriot Hotel resort. Citing municipal officials, Reuters and Associated Press reported that six foreigners, whose nationalities are still unknown, had died. It was not immediately clear what caused the submarine to sink. The Russian embassy in Egypt has said that that all of the tourists on board the submarine were Russian. It said 45 passengers were on board the vessel, including children, in a Facebook post. The local governorate’s office told Reuters that all of those confirmed dead were foreign citizens, while survivors had been ferried by ambulance to several hospitals in the city. Emergency crews were able to rescue 29 people, according to a statement released by the governorate. Many tourist companies have stopped or limited travelling on the Red Sea due to the dangers from conflicts in the region. The Sindbad club’s website says it offers short tourist trips in two submarines that it operates that have a maximum depth range of 25 metres. According to the website its submarines allow tourists to “experience the beauty of the Red Sea’s underwater world without getting wet”. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20240918/trump-violence-assassination-attempt/dual",
    "description": "前总统特朗普把周日的暗杀未遂事件归咎于总统拜登和副总统贺锦丽，称被捕的嫌疑人受了他们政治攻击的影响。 Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Within days of former President Donald J. Trump vilifying immigrants on national television with false stories about Haitian migrants eating pet dogs and cats in an Ohio town, someone began threatening to blow up schools, City Hall and other public buildings, forcing evacuations and prompting a wave of fear . 前总统特朗普在全国电视直播的大选辩论中用虚假故事诋毁移民，称俄亥俄州一个小镇的海地移民吃当地人的宠物狗和猫，没过几天，有人开始威胁要炸学校、市政厅和其他公共建筑， 迫使人们撤离并引发了一波恐慌 。 Days later, authorities said, a man who described himself online as a disaffected former Trump supporter made his way with a semiautomatic rifle to the former president’s Florida golf course, evidently looking to take a shot . He was thwarted only when an observant Secret Service agent spotted him and opened fire first. 几天后，当局表示，一名在网上自称心怀不满的特朗普前支持者携带一把半自动步枪来到这名前总统在佛罗里达的高尔夫球场， 显然要找机会开枪 。因为一名细心的特勤局特工注意到了他，并先开了枪，这才阻扰了他的计划。 And so it goes in 2024. In the space of less than a week, the once and possibly future commander in chief was both a seeming inspiration and an apparent target of the political violence that has increasingly come to shape American politics in the modern era. Bomb threats and attempted assassinations now have become part of the landscape, shocking and horrific, yet not so much that they have forced any real national reckoning. 这就是2024年的情况。在不到一周的时间里，这名曾经是、未来也有可能是最高统帅的人似乎既是政治暴力灵感的来源，也显然成了目标，这种暴力正在越来越多地塑造着现代美国政治。炸弹威胁和暗杀企图现已成为政治景观的一部分，令人震惊、骇人听闻，尽管还并没有频繁到迫使全国做出任何真正的清算的程度。 “One of the things I’m most concerned about right now is the normalization of political violence in our political system. It’s on the increase,” Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a member of a bipartisan task force already investigating the July 13 assassination attempt against Mr. Trump , said in an interview. “Now we’re on the second one in as many months and it just shows the extent to which this has become pervasive.” “我现在最担心的事情之一是，我们政治体系中的政治暴力常态化。这种暴力正在增加，”科罗拉多州的联邦众议员、民主党人杰森·克罗在接受采访时说，他是调查 今年7月13日针对特朗普暗杀未遂事件 的一个两党特别工作组成员。“现在是两个月内第二次发生这种暴力，这恰恰表明了政治暴力的普遍程度。” President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris both issued statements condemning the latest incident, but the campaign continued uninterrupted. Barely four hours after Mr. Trump was hustled into a motorcade away from the golf club for his protection, his finance team sent out an email to its fund-raising list with a button to click to make a donation. “My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life!” Mr. Trump said in the email. Ms. Harris’s fund-raising emails continued as well. 拜登总统和贺锦丽副总统都发表声明谴责了最近这次事件，但竞选活动不受干扰地继续进行。特勤人员为了保护特朗普匆忙将他送上车，车队带着他离开高尔夫俱乐部还不到四小时，他的财务团队就向筹款者名单发了一封电子邮件，上面有一个让收件人捐款的按钮。“在又一次暗杀企图之后，我的决心更加坚定！”特朗普在电子邮件中写道。贺锦丽的筹款电子邮件也在继续发出。 Mr. Trump, who as recently as last week’s debate with Ms. Harris blamed Democrats for the shooting at a rally in Butler, Pa., that struck his ear in July, attributed Sunday’s attempt to the president and vice president as well, arguing that the arrested suspect was acting in response to their political attacks. 近在上周与贺锦丽的大选辩论中，特朗普还把7月发生在 宾夕法尼亚州巴特勒竞选造势活动上的枪击事件 归咎于民主党人，他在那起枪击事件中耳朵受伤。对于周日的枪击事件，他也归咎于现任总统和副总统，称被捕的嫌疑人受了他们政治攻击的影响。 “He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,” Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday . “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.” “他信了拜登和贺锦丽的话，照着去做了，” 特朗普周一对福克斯新闻说 。“他们的言论让我遭了枪击，我才是要拯救这个国家的人，他们是摧毁这个国家的人——从里面到外面。” Even as he complained that the Democrats had made him a target by calling him a threat to democracy, he repeated his own assertion that “these are people that want to destroy our country” and called them “the enemy from within” — certainly language no less provocative than that used about him. 就在他抱怨民主党人把他称为民主的威胁，使他成为攻击目标的时候，他重复了自己的说法，即“这些人想要摧毁我们的国家”，并把他们称为“来自内部的敌人”——这些话的煽动性丝毫不亚于用在他身上的说法。 Indeed, within hours, his campaign emailed a list of quotes from Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris and other Democrats attacking Mr. Trump with phrases like “a threat to our democracy” and a “threat to this nation,” without noting that just last week during the debate the former president said “they’re the threat to democracy.” 的确，他的竞选团队几小时内就发了一封电子邮件，列出了拜登、贺锦丽和其他民主党人攻击特朗普时使用的说法，如“对我们民主的威胁”、“对这个国家的威胁”，却只字不提这位前总统在上周的大选辩论中说的“他们是对民主的威胁”。 One of Mr. Trump’s most prominent and vocal supporters went so far as to question why Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris have not been targeted for murder. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala,” Elon Musk, the billionaire social media owner, wrote online . 特朗普最知名、最直言不讳的支持者之一甚至质疑，为什么拜登和贺锦丽没有成为谋杀目标。社交媒体所有者、亿万富翁埃隆·马斯克 在网上写道 ：“竟然没有人试图暗杀拜登/卡玛拉。” Mr. Musk later deleted the post and called it a joke, but the White House pushed back. “Violence should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about,” said Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman. “This rhetoric is irresponsible.” 马斯克后来删了这篇帖子，称其为玩笑，但白宫进行了反击。“暴力只应受到谴责，绝不能受到鼓励，或当成玩笑，”白宫发言人安德鲁·贝茨说。“这种言论是不负责任的。” American history has been marked by periods of political violence before. Four sitting presidents have been killed in office, and another was shot and seriously wounded. A former president likewise was shot and survived , and plenty of others who lived in the White House have been targets. But two attempts on the life of a former president within two months still stands out, especially in the heat of an election in which he is a leading candidate for his old job. 美国在历史上经历过政治暴力时期。在任总统当中，有四人遇刺身亡，还有一人遭枪击受重伤。一名前总统也 曾遭枪击但幸免于难 ，许多曾在白宫居住的人也成为刺杀的目标。但一位前总统在两个月内经历了两次暗杀未遂事件仍然引人注目，尤其是在竞选的白热化时期，他作为主要候选人想再次当选总统。 Perhaps the closest analogy might be President Gerald R. Ford, who survived two assassination attempts in a little over two weeks in 1975. More hauntingly, though, the efforts to kill Mr. Trump recalled for many 1968, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were gunned down two months apart. Those assassinations came during a moment of broader violence in American streets amid a sense of fraying societal bonds, something that worries many leaders today too. 也许最接近的类比可能是杰拉尔德·福特总统，他在1975年的短短两周内躲过了两次暗杀。但更令人难忘的是，特朗普经历的两次暗杀未遂事件让许多人想起了1968年，当时，马丁·路德·金牧师和罗伯特·肯尼迪事隔两个月先后遇刺。那些暗杀发生在美国街头出现了更广泛的暴力、人们感到社会纽带正在瓦解的时刻，这也是当今许多领导人担心的问题。 At the heart of today’s eruption of political violence is Mr. Trump, a figure who seems to inspire people to make threats or take actions both for him and against him. He has long favored the language of violence in his political discourse, encouraging supporters to beat up hecklers , threatening to shoot looters and undocumented migrants , mocking a near-fatal attack on the husband of the Democratic House speaker and suggesting that a general he deemed disloyal be executed . 今天，特朗普居于政治暴力爆发的核心位置，他似乎激励了人们既为支持他、也为反对他而发出威胁或采取行动。长期以来，他在政治演说中一直喜欢使用暴力的语言，鼓励支持者 殴打在他演说时起哄的人 ，威胁 射杀抢劫者 和 无证移民 ，嘲笑 民主党众议院议长的丈夫 遭受的几乎致命的袭击，并建议将他认为不忠诚的一名将军 处决 。 While Mr. Trump insists his fiery speech to supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, was not responsible for the subsequent ransacking of the Capitol, he resisted pleas from advisers and his own daughter that day to do more to stop the assault. He even suggested that the mob might be right to want to hang his vice president and has since embraced the attackers as patriots whom he may pardon if elected again. 虽然特朗普坚称，他在2021年1月6日对支持者发表的激烈讲话不是导致后来国会大厦被洗劫的原因，但他拒绝了顾问和女儿那天要求他采取更多措施阻止袭击国会大厦的请求。他甚至暗示，暴徒想绞死他的副总统可能是对的，后来他一直把袭击者视为爱国者，如果他再次当选总统，也许会赦免他们。 Mr. Trump does not pause to reflect on the impact of his own words. Just last week, his false pet-eating accusations against Haitian migrants during his debate with Ms. Harris were quickly followed by bomb threats that turned life upside-down in Springfield, Ohio, and he did nothing to discourage them. After 33 bomb threats, Ohio’s governor said Monday that law enforcement would conduct daily sweeps of schools in the town. 特朗普没有停下来反思过自己言论的影响。就在上周，他在与贺锦丽辩论时污蔑海地移民吃宠物，之后不久就有人发出炸弹威胁，颠覆了俄亥俄州斯普林菲尔德的人们的生活，而他没有采取任何措施阻止这些威胁。在收到了33起炸弹威胁后，俄亥俄州州长周一表示，执法部门将每天对该镇的学校进行搜查。 Asked by a reporter if he denounced the bomb threats, he demurred. “I don’t know what happened with the bomb threats,” he said . “I know that it’s been taken over by illegal migrants, and that’s a terrible thing that happened.” 当记者问特朗普是否谴责炸弹威胁时，他不置可否。“我不知道炸弹威胁是怎么回事，” 他说 。“我知道镇子被非法移民接管了，那是可怕的事情。” Mr. Trump’s critics have at times employed the language of violence as well, though not as extensively and repeatedly at the highest levels. The former president’s allies distributed a video compilation online of various Trump opponents saying they would like to punch him in the face or the like. Some of the more extreme voices on social media in the past day have mocked or minimized the close call at the Florida golf course. Mr. Trump’s allies often decry what they call Trump Derangement Syndrome, the notion that his critics despise him so much they have lost their minds. 特朗普的批评者有时也使用暴力的语言，尽管没有在最高层被如此广泛地重复过。这名前总统的盟友在网上发了一个视频合集，里面是特朗普的反对者说他们想打他的脸或诸如此类的东西。过去一天，社交媒体上一些较为极端的声音嘲笑或淡化了特朗普在佛罗里达高尔夫球场遇险的情况。特朗普的盟友经常指责这些人有所谓的“特朗普精神错乱综合征”，即他的批评者们对他的反感已经超出了理性范围。 Anger, of course, has long been the animating force of Mr. Trump’s time in politics — both the anger he stirs among supporters against his rivals and the anger that he generates among opponents who come to loathe him. Predictions that he might rethink that after he narrowly escaped death in Butler proved ephemeral. By halfway through his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention five days later, he was back to himself. 当然，愤怒一直是使特朗普的政治生涯保持活力的力量，一方面他在支持者当中激起了针对其对手的愤怒，另外一方面也在厌恶他的人当中激起对他的愤怒。对于他在巴特勒逃过一劫后可能会重新考虑这点的预测被事实证明是短暂的。五天后，在共和党全国代表大会上 发表接受提名的演讲 不到一半时，他已回到了老样子。 But it is a measure of how much political violence has become a part of modern American culture — not accepted, perhaps, but more and more expected — that the latest incident may make no more difference than the first. The shock from the shooting in Butler wore off relatively quickly as attention turned to other developments. The shock from this one may not last any longer. 但最近这次暗杀未遂也许不会带来与第一次不同的反响，这表明政治暴力已成为当代美国文化的一部分——也许没有被接受，但人们越来越多地有所预料。随着人们的注意力转向其他事态发展，巴特勒枪击案带来的震惊比较快地消退了。这次枪击事件带来的震惊可能也不会持续更久。 Peter Baker是《纽约时报》首席白宫记者。他报道了最近的五位美国总统的新闻，有时也撰写将总统和美国政府置于更宏观的背景和历史框架下的分析性文章。 点击查看更多关于他的信息。 翻译：Cindy Hao 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "title": "「中英」被中国囚禁18年，美国华裔牧师林大卫获释",
    "link": "https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20240918/china-american-pastor-david-lin/dual",
    "description": "Greg Baker/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images An American pastor who had been imprisoned in China for nearly 20 years was released unexpectedly on Sunday and has returned to the United States, according to the State Department. 据美国国务院称，一名关押在中国近20年的美国牧师周日出人意料地获释，并已返回美国。 The pastor, David Lin, 68, was detained in 2006 and later sentenced to life in prison for contract fraud. He had been trying to open a Christian training center in Beijing; his supporters said the Chinese authorities often brought fraud charges against leaders of “ house churches ” and other religious establishments not controlled by the ruling Communist Party. 这位牧师名叫林大卫，现年68岁，于2006年遭拘捕 ，后来因合同诈骗罪被判处终身监禁。他一直试图在北京开设一家基督教培训中心；他的支持者表示，中国当局常常对不受执政的共产党控制的“ 家庭教会 ”和其他宗教机构的负责人提出诈骗指控。 Mr. Lin was one of three Americans whom the State Department had labeled “wrongfully detained” by China. Generally speaking, that is a designation Washington uses for U.S. citizens who it says were taken hostage to influence American policy. Dui Hua, a U.S.-based human rights group, estimates that more than 200 other Americans are “under coercive measures” in China. 林大卫是美国国务院认定为遭 中国“错误羁押”的三名美国人之一。一般说来， 这个称呼是华盛顿用来形容 那些为了达到影响美国政策的目的而遭到劫持的美国公民。总部位于美国的人权组织对话基金会 估计 ，另有200多名美国人在中国处于“强制措施”之下。 Mr. Lin’s daughter, Alice Lin, told Politico in an interview that “no words can express the joy we have” about his release. 林牧师的女儿爱丽丝在 接受Politico采访时表示 ，对于他的获释，“无法用言语来表达我们的喜悦。” “We have a lot of time to make up for,” she was quoted as saying. “我们有很多失去的时间需要弥补，”报道援引她的话说。 In Washington, U.S. officials were conspicuously muted about Mr. Lin’s release, perhaps not wishing to aggravate Chinese officials by making it look as though Beijing had made a major political concession to the United States. Relations with China have been in a relative thaw in recent months after an acrimonious start during President Biden’s tenure. 在华盛顿，美国官员对林牧师的获释表现得相对低调，也许是希望避免让北京看起来像是对美国做出了重大的政治让步，从而激怒中国官员。在拜登总统上任初期，中美关系一度剑拔弩张，在最近几个月里，紧张的气氛有所缓和。 “We welcome his release,” the State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said without flourish. “我们欢迎他的释放，”国务院发言人马修·米勒不动声色地说道。 “Sometimes in diplomacy, the less said, the better,” he added. “有时候在外交上，说得越少越好，”他补充说。 He noted that Biden administration officials raise the cases of detained Americans during every high-level meeting with Chinese officials. 他指出，在与中方的每次高层会晤中，拜登政府都会提到那些遭到羁押的美国公民的案件。 The United States had repeatedly pressed Beijing to free Mr. Lin, including last month during a visit to China by Jake Sullivan , the White House national security adviser, and a July 27 meeting that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken held with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of a regional summit in Laos. Since Mr. Lin’s sentencing, the Chinese government had reduced his sentence three times; he had been scheduled for release in 2029 when he was freed. 美国曾多次向北京施压，要求释放林牧师， 包括上个月 白宫国家安全顾问 杰克·沙利文访华期间 ，以及7月27日国务卿布林肯到老挝参加区域峰会期间与中国外长王毅举行的 会晤 中。林牧师自获刑以来 三次得到中国政府的减刑；原定于2029年获释。 Mr. Miller declined to say whether China had received anything in return for Mr. Lin’s release, noting only that “it’s something that we have been working on for some time.” 米勒拒绝透露中国是否通过释放林牧师获得了好处，仅表示“这是我们在一段时间以来一直在努力的事情”。 The Chinese government has made no public statements about the release. But it has made efforts to stabilize relations with the United States in recent months as China’s economy has struggled. Despite flare-ups over trade restrictions, Taiwan and other issues, Chinese officials have agreed to more military-to-military communications with their American counterparts, and they have taken steps to restrict the flow of fentanyl into the United States. 中国政府尚未就此发表公开声明。但随着中国经济陷入困境，近几个月来，它一直在努力稳定与美国的关系。尽管双方在贸易限制、台湾和其他问题上发生了冲突，但中方已同意与美方增加军事方面的交流，并采取措施限制芬太尼流入美国。 “China is looking for ways to be perceived as less confrontational in some ways,” said Kevin Slaten, a Taiwan-based researcher who leads China Dissent Monitor, a project that tracks protest in the country. “Prisoner releases would certainly align with these efforts.” “中国正在想方设法让外界觉得它在某些方面并不是那么有对抗性，”驻台湾的研究者史凯文(Kevin Slaten)说道，他也是追踪中国抗议活动的异言网的负责人。“释放囚犯无疑与这些努力相一致。” “China detains so many thousands of political prisoners that it is a small cost for the party-state to release a few people if it thinks it can gain some diplomatic good will,” Mr. Slaten added. 史凯文还表示，“中国关押了成千上万的政治犯，如果这个党国认为能获得一些外交善意，那么释放几个人对它来说只是很小的成本。” Mr. Lin, a naturalized American citizen who was born in China, was living in California when he began making frequent trips to China in the 1990s, trying to convert others to Christianity, according to ChinaAid , a U.S.-based Christian activist organization. 据美国基督教活动组织 对华援助协会称 ，林牧师是出生在中国的归化美国公民，从上世纪90年代开始频繁前往中国，试图说服 人们皈依基督教，当时他住在加利福尼亚州。 China’s political environment at the time was looser, as the country tried to project openness to build its economy. But the Communist Party has always been wary of organized religion, which it sees as a potential threat to its control. During the run-up to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the government cracked down, expelling over 100 foreign missionaries from China by the end of 2007, according to congressional testimony by Bob Fu, the founder of ChinaAid. 中国当时的政治环境较为宽松，因为它试图通过展现开放来建设经济。但中共始终对有组织的宗教持谨慎态度，认为有可能威胁到它的统治。在2008年北京奥运会前夕，政府加大了打压力度，根据对华援助协会创办人傅希秋在 国会的证词 ，截止2007年底，中国将100多名外国传教士驱逐出境。 Mr. Lin was initially detained for helping to construct a building for a house church. He was later charged with contract fraud. 林牧师最初因帮助家庭教会盖一座教堂而遭羁押。他后来被指控犯有合同诈骗罪。 In prison in Beijing, Mr. Lin ministered to fellow inmates and translated the Bible into Chinese, according to the U.S. government’s Commission on International Religious Freedom . But his health was said to be declining. 据美国政府的国际宗教自由委员会称 ，在北京的监狱里，林牧师 成为了狱友们的牧师，并将《圣经》翻译成中文。但他的健康状况据说在恶化。 Family members of Mr. Lin had said that Washington was moving too slowly on his case. “We don’t know how much time either of us has left,” Alice Lin wrote in a letter to The Wall Street Journal in April. “He is elderly now, and I have cancer. We can’t afford to wait.” She called on senior diplomats to prioritize her father’s freedom when they traveled to China. 林牧师的家人表示，华盛顿在处理他的案子上进展太缓慢。“我们不知道我们俩还剩下多少时间，”爱丽丝在4月份 给《华尔街日报》的一封信中 写道。“他现在年纪大了，而我得了癌症。我们等不起了。”她呼吁高级外交官在访问中国时优先考虑她父亲的自由问题。 Beijing has continued to crack down on Christians and other believers. Since June 2022, China Dissent Monitor has documented 36 cases of the government targeting Christians for peacefully practicing their beliefs, with raids, arrests, surveillance and other methods, Mr. Slaten said. 北京继续对基督徒和其他信仰者进行打压。史凯文指出，自2022年6月以来，异言网记录到36宗政府针对和平实践信仰的基督徒的案件，采取的手段包括突袭、逮捕、监视及其他方式。 The other two Americans whom the State Department considers wrongfully detained are Kai Li and Mark Swidan. Mr. Li, a businessman from New York, has been held in China since 2016 on espionage charges , and Mr. Swidan, a Texas businessman, since 2012 on drug-related charges. The State Department has warned Americans to “reconsider travel” to China because of the risk of wrongful detentions and “arbitrary enforcement of local laws.” 被国务院认定为错误羁押的另外两名美国人是李凯和马克·斯威丹。来自纽约的商人李凯因 间谍指控 自2016年以来被关押在中国，而得克萨斯州商人斯威丹因与毒品有关的指控自2012年以来被关押。国务院一直 警告美国民众 “ 慎重考虑”前往中国旅行，因为可能存在错误羁押和“随意执行当地法律”的风险。 In a statement, Diane Foley, whose son James was kidnapped and murdered in Syria a decade ago and who runs a foundation dedicated to the plight of Americans detained abroad, called Mr. Lin’s release “an encouraging sign.” She added that it had been three years since China last released wrongfully detained Americans. 黛安·福利的儿子詹姆斯于十年前在叙利亚遭绑架后遇害，她运营着一个致力于关注被拘留在国外的美国人的基金会。她在一份声明中称，林牧师的获释是“一个令人鼓舞的迹象”。她还说，距离中国上一次释放遭错误羁押的美国人已经过去了三年时间。 The James W. Foley Foundation statement noted that China “holds at least 11 other Americans captive in prison or is blocking them from leaving the country using exit bans” and that “these Americans have been held, on average, over eight years.” 詹姆斯·W·福利基金会的声明指出，中国“至少还关押着另外11名美国人，或者利用出境禁令阻止他们离境”，并且“这些美国人平均被关押了八年以上”。 It said that Ms. Foley hoped that Mr. Lin’s case could “serve as a model for further dialogue and negotiation” to win the release of all Americans in China. 声明称，福利希望林牧师的案子能“成为进一步对话和谈判的典范”，以争取释放所有关押在中国的美国人。 But Mr. Lin’s release will do little to change the overall tenor of the two countries’ relationship, said Drew Thompson, a former Defense Department official who is now a senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. 然而，前国防部官员、现任新加坡南洋理工大学高级研究员的德鲁·汤普森表示，林牧师的释放对两国关系的整体基调影响不大。 “Releasing an individual who’s been in jail for almost 20 years is not exactly a concession that would get to the heart of United States concerns about China’s governance,” he said. “释放一个在牢里被关了近20年的人，并不能算作一个触及美国对中国治理方式的核心担忧的让步，”他说。 王月眉(Vivian Wang)是《纽约时报》驻华记者，常驻北京，撰写关于中国的崛起及野心如何塑造普通人日常生活的报道。 点击查看更多关于她的信息。 翻译：纽约时报中文网 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "description": "Tonje Thilesen for The New York Times Will and Rose met online 10 years ago. His screen name was professorparsley, and he looked the part — tall and thin, with glasses, features that Rose found attractive. On their first date, Rose learned that Will was a college student living with his mother, and his handle came from a nickname given to him by a child at an art camp where he worked. They laugh about it now, as they do with most things. Will thought Rose was exciting and direct. He grew up in suburban Ontario, and she was from Southern California, which was like another world to him. Right away, what they loved about each other were their differences. 威尔和罗丝是十年前在网上认识的。他的网名是“欧芹教授”，看上去很合适——又高又瘦，戴着眼镜，这些都很吸引罗丝。他们第一次约会时，罗丝得知威尔是一名大学生，和母亲住在一起，这个网名来自他工作的一个艺术营的孩子给他起的绰号。他们说起这件事就大笑，说起大多数事情也都是欢声笑语。威尔觉得罗斯既让人兴奋又为人直率。他在安大略省的郊区长大，而她来自南加州，对他来说，那就像是另一个世界。他们之间的不同很快就成了他们喜欢彼此的地方。 Rose was drawn to how stable Will seemed — so unlike the other men she had dated, who dreaded commitment. Their relationship survived multiple moves, about a year of long-distance dating and the challenges of finding time to be together while living with parents and roommates. Now, seven years into their marriage, they have their own place: a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles, where Rose sees Pilates clients. Will is gone during the day, teaching, and at night they cuddle in bed and watch television. “It’s my favorite part of the day,” Rose says. (Rose and Will are middle names. All subjects asked to be referred to by their first names, middle names or a nickname, out of concerns for their privacy.) 罗丝喜欢威尔的稳重——和她约会过的其他男人不同，他们害怕承诺。他们的关系经受了许多考验，包括多次搬家，大约一年的异地恋，以及与父母和室友同住时如何找到时间在一起。现在，他们结婚七年了，在洛杉矶有了自己的房子：一套一居室的公寓，罗丝在那里接待自己的普拉提客户。威尔白天出去教书，晚上他们依偎在床上看电视。“这是我一天中最喜欢的时光，”罗丝说。（罗丝和威尔都是中间名。出于对隐私的考虑，所有受试者都要求用他们的名字、中间名或昵称来称呼他们。） As much as Will grounds her, Rose feels that the familiar calm of their relationship also shuts her down sexually. They go months without sex, but they don’t lack intimacy. They have a policy of never refusing a hug, something they instituted to resolve the minor disagreements that inevitably crop up in any relationship. They have also talked candidly about how, for her, the safe predictability of their marriage — the quality she loves about their lives together — dulls her sex drive. She knows that can be confusing, even frustrating, for Will, but she doesn’t like the idea of forcing herself to have sex. Rose’s mother, now divorced, felt obligated to have sex with Rose’s father once a week. That’s not the kind of relationship Rose wants. 虽然威尔让她感觉踏实，但罗丝觉得他们习惯的平静关系也让她在性方面感到压抑。他们有时几个月没有性生活，但并不缺乏亲密感。他们有一个永远不拒绝拥抱的原则，这是他们为了解决任何关系中都不可避免会出现的小分歧而制定的。他们还坦率地谈到，对她来说，他们婚姻的安全可预测性——在共同生活中，这一点是她所喜欢的——抑制了她的性欲。她知道这会让威尔感到困惑，甚至沮丧，但她不想强迫自己做爱。罗丝的父母已经离婚，她的母亲曾经觉得觉得有义务每周和罗丝的父亲做爱一次，这不是罗丝想要的关系。 To get into a sexual mood, Rose relies on a set of rituals to help build anticipation — doing her hair and makeup, shaving her legs, having a glass of wine over dinner or, when their schedules allow, going on vacation to break out of their routines. Will doesn’t need to do anything to feel ready for sex, and Rose sees this as another way in which they’re different. Over the years, they have accepted that this is what their sex life looks like, and will look like, if they want to be together, which they do. 为了进入愿意做爱的状态，罗丝依靠一系列的仪式来帮助建立期待——做头发和化妆，刮腿毛，晚餐时喝红酒，或者，当他们的日程允许时去度假，以便打破生活常规。威尔不需要为性做任何准备，罗丝认为这是他们之间的另一个不同之处。多年来，他们已经接受了这样的性生活方式，如果他们想在一起，他们性生活就是这样的，他们也的确想让关系继续。 During the pandemic, the couple went more than a year without having sex, but they savored their extra time together. Rose used to spend hours driving in traffic to different workout studios, coming home late, not seeing her husband much. Stuck at home, they took walks around their neighborhood. They talked constantly. They started taking online yoga classes together, a hobby that stuck. Will appreciates these smaller opportunities to connect. Rose thinks she’s not the nurturing type, but Will disagrees. “She’s not stingy in spirit or time,” he says. 疫情期间，这对夫妇有一年多没有性生活，但他们很享受有更多在一起的时间。罗丝过去常常花几个小时开车去不同的健身房，很晚才回家，很少见到丈夫。被困在家里的时候，他们在附近散步。不停地交谈。他们开始一起上在线瑜伽课，这个爱好一直延续了下来。威尔很欣赏这些小小的交流机会。罗丝认为她不是那种会照顾人的人，但威尔不这么认为。“她在精神上和时间上都不吝啬，”他说。 Sometimes they shower together and hold each other naked, without any expectation of sex. Though Will remains hopeful that these moments will lead to something else, he doesn’t push it. 有时他们一起洗澡，赤裸着抱在一起，但并不期待发生性关系。虽然威尔仍然希望这些时刻会有别的结果，但他并不强求。 Cultural attitudes about the role sex plays in a marriage have evolved significantly over time. Where once marital sex was primarily a means for bearing children, in recent decades, the conventional wisdom was that frequent sex was integral to a happy union. During the 1990s, a new wave of sex positivity coincided with the ascendancy of different forms of therapy, including couples counseling. Experts coached couples on how to strengthen their marriages, often relying on the belief that healthy relationships included consistent sex with partners. By the 2010s, appointment sex had become one popular method for maintaining intimacy and, somewhat implicitly, safeguarding against separation. 随着时间的推移 ，人们对性在婚姻中所扮演角色的文化态度发生了很大变化。过去，婚姻中的性行为主要是为了生儿育女，但近几十年来，常规观念认为，频繁的性行为是幸福婚姻不可或缺的一部分。在20世纪90年代，随着包括夫妻咨询在内的各种治疗方式的兴起， 性积极也掀起了新的浪潮。专家们指导夫妻们如何巩固婚姻，他们通常认为，健康的婚姻关系包括与伴侣持续的性行为。到2010年代， 预约式 性爱 已经成为一种保持亲密关系的流行方法，并在一定程度上暗含防止分手的意思。 In more recent years, however, both relationship experts and couples themselves have been gradually dismantling some of these commonly held views, working to destigmatize the unconventional approaches that some take to stay together. Online groups have sprung up for couples who challenge basic assumptions that spouses should share a bedroom or even a home. Sharon Hyman, who runs a Facebook group called Apartners for couples who have chosen to live separately, told me that many of the members in her community find their sex lives improve when they don’t spend every minute together. “My goal is to show that there are healthy options for relationships,” Hyman says. “No one size fits all.” 然而，近年来，夫妻关系专家和夫妻自己都在逐渐摒弃一些普遍持有的观点，努力为那些用于维持婚姻的非常规方法正名。一些夫妻挑战了夫妻应该共用卧室、甚至住在一个家里的基本假设，他们的网络小组大量涌现。沙伦·海曼在Facebook上管理了一个名为“Apartners”的小组，专门为选择分开居住的夫妇服务。她告诉我，她所在小组的许多成员发现，当他们不再时时刻刻在一起时，他们的性生活得到了改善。“我的目标是向人们展示，健康的关系有许多种，”海曼说。“没有一种方法适合所有人。” One effect of the ever-changing sexual climate is that many couples today are simply less willing to tolerate what the psychotherapist Esther Perel calls “boredom” in the bedroom. Perel has made a career of articulating how domestic overexposure saps eroticism, which requires some intrigue, mystery and unfamiliarity. That’s not to suggest that long-term love and desire are impossible, but according to Perel, keeping sexual interest alive requires getting creative. In her podcast, “Where Should We Begin?” Perel helps couples explore and articulate their fantasies, honor each other as individuals and experiment with new approaches to fulfilling their desires together. 不断变化的性观念造成的影响是，今天的许多夫妻根本不愿意忍受心理治疗师埃斯特·佩雷尔所称的卧室里的“无聊”。佩雷尔的职业生涯里一直在阐明夫妻之间的过度接触如何削弱了性欲，而性欲是需要一些好奇、神秘和陌生的。这并不是说长期的爱情和欲望是不可能的，但根据佩雷尔的说法，保持性兴趣需要创意。在她的播客“ 从何说起？ ”中，佩雷尔帮助夫妻探索和表达他们的幻想，尊重彼此的个性，并尝试新的方法，一起满足他们的欲望。 For Perel, as for many other relationship experts, that sometimes means re-examining investment in another foundational premise of marriage: monogamy. The advice columnist Dan Savage, too, has argued that monogamy isn’t entirely plausible, or pleasurable, for everyone, and is critical of Americans’ obsession with moralizing infidelity. He encourages married people to be honest with each other about how hard it is to carry the responsibility of fulfilling their partner’s sexual and emotional needs for decades on end. 对佩雷尔和许多其他关系专家来说，这有时意味着重新审视对婚姻另一个基本前提的投入：单配 制。 咨询专栏作家丹·萨维奇也认为 ， 单配制并非对所有人来说都完全合理或令人愉快，他对美国人痴迷于将不忠变为道德问题持批评态度。他鼓励已婚人士坦诚地告诉对方，几十年来一直承担满足伴侣在性和情感方面需求的责任是多么困难。 Tonje Thilesen for The New York Times While some are questioning the standard of monogamous sex in marriage by exploring polyamorous and open relationships, others are pushing back against the pressure to have sex at all. In fact, Americans on the whole are having less sex than they used to — across race, gender, region, educational level and work status. One study found that American adults born in the 1990s are having less sex than older generations; they are in fewer steady partnerships, and those who are partnered are also having less sex. The 2021 General Social Survey found that about 50 percent of all adults polled had sex once a month or less , with half of those people reporting they hadn’t had sex for a year. Researchers have speculated about the reasons for this 30-year sexual low, from isolation caused by technology to cultural conversations about consent. 有些人通过探索多角恋和开放关系来质疑婚姻中的单配制标准，还有一些人则在抵制发生性行为的压力。事实上，从整体上看，美国人的性生活比以前少了——不分种族、性别、地区、教育水平和就业情况。一项研究发现，20世纪90年代出生的美国成年人的性生活少于老一辈；他们的稳定伴侣更少，在有伴侣时的 性生活也更少。 2021年的综合社会调查发现 ，接受调查的所有成年人中，约有50%的人每月性生活一次或更少，其中一半的人报告说他们一年没有性生活。研究人员推测了这30年来性低潮的原因，包括从科技导致的孤立到关于 性同意的文化对话。 Many younger women, for instance, shaped in part by the #MeToo movement, are engaging in intentional abstinence. There are trends on TikTok about going “boysober,” a word coined by the comedian Hope Woodard, who says that taking a break from sex can be empowering for women who previously altered their desires to accommodate men. The digital feminist 4B movement, which originated in South Korea but has spread globally through social media, advocates a rejection of childbearing, as well as heterosexual dating, marriage and sex. “Platonic life partners,” meanwhile — friends who commit to owning a home and even raising children together — insist that sex and romance are not necessary to lifelong unions. 例如，许多年轻女性在一定程度上受到#MeToo（我也是）运动的影响，进行了有意识的 节欲。TikTok上出现了关于“ 戒掉男孩 ”(boysober)的趋势，这个词是喜剧演员霍普·伍达德创造的，她说，对于那些以前为了适应男性而改变自己欲望的女性来说，暂停性生活可以赋予她们力量。数字女权主义4B运动起源于韩国，但已通过社交媒体传播到全球。该运动倡导拒绝生育，以及拒绝异性恋约会、婚姻和性行为。与此同时，“柏拉图式的生活伴侣”——承诺共同拥有一个家，甚至共同抚养孩子的朋友——坚持认为性和浪漫不是终身结合的必要条件。 The sex educator and researcher Emily Nagoski is resistant to the idea that frequent sex should be a chief component of every committed relationship. Nagoski — who has been open about her own hiatus from marital sex — doesn’t endorse obligatory sex, nor does she encourage aiming for any sexual base line in terms of regularity or behavior. Drawing on the work of the Canadian sexologist Peggy Kleinplatz, Nagoski believes that low desire can sometimes be evidence of good judgment. “It’s not dysfunctional not to want sex you don’t like,” Nagoski says. 性教育者和研究者艾米丽·纳格斯基不认为频繁的性行为应该是每一段深度投入的关系的主要组成部分。纳格斯基对自己暂停婚姻性生活的事并不讳言，她不赞同履行义务的性爱，也不赞成对性生活的规律性或行为设定任何底线。纳格斯基借鉴了加拿大性学家佩吉·克莱因普拉茨的研究成果，认为性欲低有时可能是判断力良好的证据。纳格斯基说：“不想要你不喜欢的性并不是功能障碍。” In her new book, “Come Together,” Nagoski urges couples who want to explore their sexualities and deepen their sexual bond to begin by figuring out what each person wants when they want sex. For many, sex represents freedom from the ordinary, but what it takes to get there will look different for every couple and is likely to change over time. After all, desires don’t always align, or they evolve in unexpected ways. 在她的新书《 一起来 》(Come Together)中，纳格斯基敦促那些想探索自己性取向并加深性联系的夫妇首先弄清楚每个人想要性爱的时候，想要的是什么。对许多人来说，性代表着从平凡中解脱出来的自由，但实现这一目标所需的条件对每对夫妇来说都是不同的，而且可能会随着时间而改变。毕竟，欲望并不总是一致的，或者它们会以意想不到的方式演变。 Michelle and John met in 2005 at a party, and in the early years of their relationship, they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Four years ago, however, after experiencing what she calls a “traumatic” childbirth, Michelle began to worry that intercourse would cause her pain. 米歇尔和约翰 在2005年的一次聚会上相识，在交往的最初几年，他们充满激情。然而，四年前，在经历了她所谓的“创伤性”分娩后，米歇尔开始担心性交会引起疼痛。 She and John did not have sex for a year after they became parents. Now they can go months without it. Friends of theirs, too, seem to be experiencing new chapters in their own sex lives and opening up their marriages, which has sparked conversations between Michelle and John about the possibilities for reinvigorating their sex life. But they don’t always agree on what they want, or what they’re comfortable with. 她和约翰在为人父母后一年没有过性生活。现在他们可以一连几个月不做爱。他们的朋友们似乎也在经历性生活的新篇章，并且尝试开放婚姻，这让米歇尔和约翰开始讨论，该怎样给他们之间的性生活注入新的活力。但他们并不总是能就想要什么或者能接受什么达成一致。 John knows, however, that having sex outside the marriage is a red line for Michelle. She witnessed infidelity tear apart her parents’ relationship. “I think there’s a big fear about ‘I have an urge that may be resolved in a minute or two,’ but the sense of what could be broken is not worth the risk,” John says. 然而，约翰知道，对米歇尔来说，婚外性行为是一条红线。她目睹了不忠行为破坏她父母的关系。约翰说：“我觉得有一种担心，‘我有一种可以在一两分钟内解决的冲动’，但考虑到可能产生的破坏，冒这个险去解决它是不值得的 。” Love, for both, is about much more than fulfilling those momentary desires. After almost two decades together, they consider themselves best friends and “soul mates.” When they first began dating, Michelle was reeling from the loss of her brother, who died in a car accident. She talked with John about the experience on an early date, and they were inseparable after that. John thought she was beautiful and wanted to spend as much time with her as he could. Michelle thought he was a welcome distraction, someone who could lift her out of her grief. They went to concerts. He made her mixtapes. But there were also times when she broke down crying, and he was there for her. 对两人来说，爱情的意义远不止满足一时的欲望。在一起近二十年后，他们认为自己是最好的朋友和“灵魂伴侣”。他们刚开始约会的时候，米歇尔正沉浸在哥哥车祸丧生的悲痛中。她很早就和约翰谈起了这次经历，从那以后他们就形影不离了。约翰觉得她很美，想尽量和她呆在一起。米歇尔则乐于通过他来转移注意力，这是一个能把她从悲伤中拉出来的人。他们去听音乐会。他给她做了混音带。但也有几次，当她崩溃哭泣时，他会陪在她身边。 John used to try to comfort Michelle by saying he understood how she felt, but when he lost his own brother in 2012, he realized how wrong he had been. As he mourned, Michelle “just knew what to do in the unspoken moments — whether it was knowing when to give me space, or knowing when I needed a hug, or I just needed her to be next to me,” John says. Today, Michelle remains the “central piece” of his happiness. 约翰曾经试图安慰米歇尔，说他理解她的感受，但当他在2012年失去自己的兄弟时，他意识到自己错了。约翰说，在他哀悼的时候，米歇尔“知道在那些无法言说的时刻该怎么做——知道什么时候该给我空间，或者知道什么时候我需要一个拥抱，或者什么时候我需要她在身边”。今天，米歇尔仍然是他的幸福的“核心部分”。 Michelle and John share a one-bedroom with their daughter, and while they get some privacy during the day, they’re busy working from home. Now, most days, Michelle masturbates in the morning, while John takes their daughter to preschool. He masturbates at night in the bathroom, while watching porn on his phone. For John, it’s merely a physical release, but for Michelle, pleasuring herself serves a different purpose: She is trying to figure out what makes her feel good. Exploring her changed body alone eliminates the guilt she has when she can’t climax with her husband. She doesn’t want him to think it has anything to do with him. “I want to get there, but it’s not getting there,” she says. 两人和他们的女儿住一套一居室，虽然白天有一些私人空间，但他们都忙着在家工作。现在，大多数时候，米歇尔在早上自慰，而约翰送女儿去幼儿园。他晚上用手机看着色情片在浴室里自慰。对约翰来说，这只是一种身体上的释放，但对米歇尔来说，取悦自己有不同的目的：她想找到什么能让她感觉良好。独自探索她变化了的身体可以消除她不能和丈夫高潮时的内疚。她不想让他觉得这和他有什么关系。她说：“我想达到高潮，但却无法达到。” Of the more than 30 married people I interviewed, many, like Michelle, told me that becoming parents irrevocably changed their sex lives. Camille, who lives in California, felt her marriage was the most solid and caring relationship she had ever experienced, but becoming a mother distanced her from her desire. “It feels like something I can’t quite touch, like in another room, or another part of me that I don’t know how to access,” she says. 在我采访的30多位已婚人士中，许多人都跟米歇尔一样告诉我，成为父母不可挽回地改变了他们的性生活。卡米尔住在加州，她觉得婚姻是她经历过的最稳固、最贴心的关系，但成为母亲让她远离了自己的欲望。“感觉就像我不能触摸的东西，就像在另一个房间里，或者是我不知道该如何进入的另一个自己的部分，”她说。 Other mothers started to see sex as one more chore, another line item on their list of responsibilities. Keti, a mother of a neurodivergent child who craved being held, found that sex with her husband had become “robotic” as she began to see it as “one more demand.” Her husband was doing everything he could to support her, but she felt an obligation to get back to their old sex life, even though she wanted “desperately to go into a forest and just lie down and not hear anyone or anything.” 也有的母亲开始把性爱看作例行公事，是责任清单上的一项。凯特的孩子是一个渴望被拥抱的神经发育异常儿童，她发现自己同丈夫的性行为变得“像机器人一样”，因为她开始把它视为“又一项要求”。丈夫尽其所能支持她，但她觉得有义务回到他们以前的性生活中，尽管她“非常渴望走进一片森林，躺下来，什么人什么事都不要听”。 Lilien, who has two kids, says becoming a mother was a turning point for her. She had to leave her previous career and didn’t know who she was or what she wanted. “My identity was totally eviscerated,” she says. “I was really confused about what my worth was.” Her history of sexual assault also resurfaced in profound ways. She thought she needed to be “permeable” to nurture her children. She didn’t have the capacity to extend that physical openness to her husband. She couldn’t stand soft caresses from him, which felt like the tickling of her child’s hands. 莉莉安有两个孩子，她说成为母亲对她来说是一个转折点。她不得不离开以前的工作，不知道自己是谁，也不知道自己想要什么。“我的自我认同完全被掏空了，”她说。“我真的不知道自己的价值在哪里。”遭受性侵的往事也以深刻的方式重新浮出水面。为了养育孩子，她认为她需要做到“毫无保留”。她没有能力将身体上的开放性延伸到丈夫身上。她无法忍受他温柔的爱抚，那感觉就像孩子的手在挠她的痒痒。 Lilien’s husband, Philip, never pressured her to be intimate, for which she is grateful. “The most important thing for me was to maintain a place where the sex you have is very positive, very consensual, very understood and mutually enjoyed,” he says. Five years later, Philip knows she is still coming to terms with everything motherhood has brought into her life. Recently they started having more sex, about once every other month. Lilien loves her husband’s firm back rubs, which he’s happy to give. 莉莉安的丈夫菲利普从未强迫她与自己亲密接触，她对此很感激。他说：“对我来说，最重要的是保持一种方式，拥有非常积极的、非常自愿的、非常理解的、相互享受的性行为。”五年后，菲利普知道她仍然在适应成为母亲给她的生活带来的一切。最近他们开始有了更多的性生活，大约每隔一个月一次。莉莉恩很喜欢丈夫给她按摩后背，他也很乐意给她按摩。 Other couples, much like Rose and Will, confessed to feeling sexually misaligned with their partners as their desires shifted in different directions. Jean, a 38-year-old mother living in Virginia, told me that her husband’s interest in sex has dropped off gradually over the course of their 13-year marriage. She, on the other hand, experienced what she called “a secondary puberty” as her kids grew older and became less dependent on her. She felt “so sexually charged” that she visited her gynecologist to confirm she wasn’t having a hormonal issue. She’s now trying to figure out how to navigate her husband’s low desire. “I feel like I’m living in the upside-down a lot of the time,” she says. “My friends complain about their husbands grabbing their butt while they wash dishes, and I think, Wow, I would love to feel wanted like that.” 其他夫妇，就像罗丝和威尔一样，坦言由于欲望朝着不同的方向转移，他们感到与伴侣的性生活不协调。珍是弗吉尼亚的一位38岁的母亲，她告诉我，在13年的婚姻生活中，她丈夫对性的兴趣逐渐下降。另一方面，她经历了她所谓的“二次青春期”，因为她的孩子长大了，对她的依赖减少了。她觉得自己“性欲旺盛”，于是去看了妇科医生，确认自己不是荷尔蒙出了问题。她现在正试图弄清楚如何应对丈夫的低性欲。“我觉得自己很多时候都生活在颠倒的世界里，”她说。“朋友们抱怨说，丈夫在她们洗碗的时候抓她们的屁股，我想，哇，我也喜欢那种被需要的感觉。” Another mother, Emily, says that sex gradually became less important over the course of her 34-year marriage. When her kids were little, intimacy with her husband stalled briefly, but as their children grew older, they had a “revival of a good sex life,” Emily says. Now she is 59 and has had several operations resulting from a battle with cancer, including a hysterectomy and mastectomy. As a result, her desire lessened, and sex began to feel like “vacuuming the house” — something she did to make her husband happy. And he noticed. “If you are used to somebody responding to you in a certain way, you can tell when they are acting,” she says. “I wasn’t the same person.” 另一位母亲艾米丽说，在她34年的婚姻生活中，性逐渐变得不那么重要了。当孩子们还小的时候，她和丈夫的亲密关系一度停滞，但随着孩子长大，他们“恢复了良好的性生活”，艾米丽说。现在她59岁了，在与癌症的斗争中经历了几次手术，包括子宫切除术和乳房切除术。结果，她的性欲减弱了，性爱变得像是“用吸尘器打扫房子”——她做这些是为了让丈夫开心。他看出来了。“如果你习惯了别人以某种特定的方式回应你，那么当他们在假装时，你就能看出来，”她说。“我已经变了个人。” One night in bed, about 10 years after she went on a hormone treatment for her cancer that put her into early menopause, they had a frank conversation about their sex life. “We discussed my lack of desire, and he said that if I’m not turned on, then he’s not either,” Emily says. He admitted that his sex drive had dipped, too. So they decided not to force it. She feels there’s some cultural pressure for older people to keep up their sex lives into their 80s. She’s read, with skepticism, articles claiming that maintaining sex later in life is healthy. “Is it?” she said. “I don’t know.” 在她因癌症而接受激素治疗并提前进入更年期大约10年后，一天晚上，他们在床上坦率地谈论了他们的性生活。艾米丽说：“我们讨论了我缺乏性欲的问题，他说如果我不兴奋，那他也不会兴奋。”他承认自己的性欲也下降了。所以他们决定不再勉强。她觉得有些文化压力迫使老年人在80多岁时还保持性生活。她读过一些文章，说在晚年保持性生活有益健康，但她对此持怀疑态度。“是吗？”她说。“我不知道。” Emily feels their marriage has progressed naturally: They experienced decades of passion, and while they remain affectionate outside of the bedroom, their relationship now transcends sex in many ways. It’s about the life they’ve built together. “We’ve been in a sexless relationship for years now,” Emily says. “We get along great, but we’re more like best buds than lovers.” 艾米丽觉得他们的婚姻发展得很自然：他们经历了几十年的激情，虽然他们在卧室外仍然充满深情，但如今他们的关系在很多方面都超越了性，是关于他们共同创造的生活。“我们没有性生活已经有好几年了，”艾米丽说。“我们相处得很好，但我们更像是最好的朋友而不是恋人。” Despite their insistence that sex isn’t essential in their marriages, most of the couples I spoke with still keep track of how often they have sex. They also appear haunted by how far they deviate from perceived norms. John, for instance, hopes he and his wife can work back up to having sex two or three times a week, but admits he has no idea where that figure came from. 尽管他们都坚持认为 性在自己的婚姻中不是必不可少的，但我采访过的大多数夫妇仍然记录性生活的频率。他们似乎也对自己偏离公认标准的程度耿耿于怀。例如，约翰希望他和他的妻子能恢复到每周做爱两到三次，但他承认自己不知道这个数字是从哪里来的。 Numbers, Nagoski believes, can be a counterproductive metric. It’s impossible to hear such statistics and not judge one’s relationship against them. Numbers also don’t account for whether participants are enjoying the sex they are having. “You’re comparing yourself — you’re judging yourself as OK or inadequate — compared to a whole bunch of people you’re not having sex with, who are not having sex with you,” Nagoski says. 纳格斯基认为，用数字作为衡量标准可能适得其反。听到这样的统计数据，我们不可能不拿这些数据来判断自己的亲密关系。数据不能说明参与者是否享受自己的性生活。纳格斯基说：“你是在拿自己和一群没有和你发生性关系的人对比——拿他们来判断自己到底是不错还是不行。” For couples measuring themselves against what Nagoski calls the “fictions” of sex, or for those worried that their relationship is on the line whenever they enter the bedroom or don’t meet some monthly number, there may be too much pressure for sex to be enjoyable. It’s more important that couples establish what kind of sex is worth having. 对于那些用纳格斯基所说的性“虚构”来衡量自己的夫妇，或者对于那些担心每月性生活没有达到某个数字，婚姻关系就会受到威胁的夫妻来说，可能有太大的压力要让性生活变得愉快。更重要的是，夫妻要确定什么样的性才是值得拥有的。 Rose admits to feeling the weight of societal expectations. Recently she decided that since she and Will were rarely having sex, she would have her birth-control implant removed from her arm. During the procedure, the nurse intimated there was something wrong with Rose’s marriage. Rose felt shamed and angry. The idea that she should be living in a constant state of arousal with her husband after a decade together is, to her, ridiculous, but also part of a facade she thinks many married couples maintain. 罗丝承认自己感受到了社会期望的压力。最近，她决定，既然她和威尔很少做爱，她可以把手臂上的节育植入物取出来。在手术过程中，护士暗示罗丝的婚姻出了问题。罗丝感到羞愧和愤怒。在她看来，要求她和丈夫在一起十年后依然应该生活在一种持续的性兴奋状态中是荒谬的，但她认为这也是许多已婚夫妇维持的表面现象的一部分。 “There are people who tell you all the sex they’re having,” she says. “I feel like it’s a lot more common that a lot of people are not.” With the help of her therapist, Rose is exploring whether her A.D.H.D. may play a role in her need to seek new stimuli — not because she sees it as a problem but because she is interested in understanding her desire more fully. “Apparently the partner fatigue I experience is not so uncommon because our ‘special’ brains are always seeking out what’s new,” she says. “有些人会告诉你他们的性生活如何丰富，”她说。“我觉得更常见的情况应该是没有性生活。”在治疗师的帮助下，罗丝正在探索她寻求新刺激的需求，是否跟她的注意力缺陷多动障碍有关——不是因为她认为这是一个问题，而是因为她有兴趣更全面地了解自己的欲望。“显然，我所经历的伴侣疲劳并不罕见，因为我们‘特殊’的大脑总是在寻找新的东西，”她说。 Will sometimes turns to Buddhist writings on restraint to explore his sexuality. He jokes there may be some confirmation bias at work, but he thinks his wife’s self-awareness — and her unwillingness to force herself into sex that she doesn’t want to have — has matured him. For Will, intimacy is less about completion and more about connection. “I’ve learned, even just about the act of sex itself, the ending is not always the best part,” Will says. “There’s pleasure throughout the spectrum.” 威尔有时会求助于有关克制的佛教著作来探索自己的性欲。他开玩笑说，这其中可能有一些确认偏差，但他认为妻子的自我意识——以及她不愿意强迫自己发生她不想发生的性行为——让他变得成熟了。对威尔来说，亲密关系与其说是一种完成，不如说是一种联系。“我明白了，即使只是关于性行为本身，结果并不总是最好的部分，”威尔说。“快乐贯穿于整个过程。” In March, for Rose’s 40th birthday, they took a trip to Hawaii. She switched off her phone for hours as they sprawled out by the ocean. Will remembers turning toward his wife and staring at her, watching her relaxing, her body loose. In that moment, he wasn’t thinking about sex or how beautiful Rose looked under the sun. He was thinking about how similar they actually are. More than anything, they want to enjoy themselves in their own way, to savor the small moments when they can let the rest of the world fade away. 为了庆祝罗丝40岁生日，他们3月去了夏威夷。当他们躺在海边时，她把手机关了好几个小时。威尔记得，自己转身看着妻子，看着她放松下来，身体松弛。在那一刻，他没有想到性，也不是她在阳光下有多么美丽。他在想他们俩到底有多相似。最重要的是，他们想以自己的方式享受生活，享受那些可以忘却身外之物的微小时刻。 本文最初发表于2024年4月17日。 Amanda Montei著有《触碰——母性、厌女症、同意和控制》(Touched Out: Motherhood, Misogyny, Consent and Control)一书，现居加州。 翻译：晋其角 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "description": "位于弗吉尼亚州兰利的中央情报局乔治·布什情报中心。 Tom Brenner for The New York Times 检察官称，一名前中情局官员和联邦调查局的合同制翻译周三被判处10年监禁，他接受了数万美元现金和新高尔夫球杆等昂贵礼物，作为向中国政府提供机密信息的回报。 这起泄密事件包括确认中国情报官员感兴趣的几个人的身份，以及提供 联邦当局所称的 与国防有关的大量信息。 美国司法部在周三的一份声明中表示，这名前官员是71岁的马玉清，来自檀香山，他向一名为了调查而雇佣他的联邦调查局卧底承认，他利用自己的安全许可，帮助将受保护的信息传递给中华人民共和国上海国家安全局。 他于2020年8月被捕并受到指控 。 作为与检方达成的协议的一部分，马玉清承认了自己的参与。根据协议，他今年5月承认密谋收集和提供国防信息。 “我对自己的罪行负全部责任，”他在宣判前写给法官的一封信中写道。“无论是什么原因促使我这么做。我这样做都是不对的。” 法庭文件显示，马玉清拥有“绝密”安全许可，可以接触机密国防信息，他于1982年至1989年期间在美国中央情报局工作。 一份详细列出指控的 刑事起诉书 称，马玉清和一位未透露姓名的年长亲戚也在为中情局工作，并持有安全许可。马玉清后来说，这位亲戚是他的哥哥。起诉书称，这名亲属在受到指控时患有严重的认知疾病，他于2001年3月首次向中国情报官员提供了有关中情局人员、外国线人、机密行动、密码术和其他隐藏通信方法的信息，为此他们获得了5万美元的报酬。 这个亲戚从1967年到1983年一直在该机构工作。 一名联邦调查局卧底特工的视频截图显示，马玉清在2019年1月的一次会面中。 U.S. Justice Department, via Associated Press 在认罪协议中，马玉清承认，在2001年3月，以及他1989年从中情局辞职后的十多年里，上海国安局的特工联系他，要求他安排他的亲戚和国安局的人见面。 2003年3月，马玉清向美国联邦调查局檀香山办事处申请了一份合同制语言专家的工作。 据检察官称，联邦调查局已经知晓他与中国情报机构的联系，于是雇用他，以便“监视和调查他的活动和联系人”。 检察官表示，从2004年8月到2012年10月，马玉清在联邦调查局的一个外部地点担任兼职雇员。 在六年多的时间里，马玉清经常前往中国，并带着数千美元的现金和昂贵的礼物回来，他“经常复制、拍摄和窃取显示带有‘秘密’等美国机密标记的文件”， 检察官 表示，“目的是把它们提供给他的上线。” 检察官说表示，在2020年被联邦调查局逮捕之前，出生在香港的马玉清说，他希望“祖国”成功。与他一起工作的那位亲戚出生在上海，现已去世。 马玉清的律师周四没有立即回应记者的询问。 检察官表示，根据认罪协议的条款，面临终身监禁的马玉清必须在余生与美国政府合作，包括接受美国政府机构的盘问。 服刑期满后，马玉清将面临五年的监督释放。他目前被关押在檀香山的联邦拘留中心。 Johnny Diaz是《纽约时报》记者，自迈阿密报道突发新闻。 点击查看更多关于他的信息。 翻译：纽约时报中文网 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "link": "https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20240912/chinese-h1b-visa/dual",
    "description": "Lisk Feng 过去三年里，戴维·郑（音）在抽美国H-1B工作签证的时候总是运气不佳。他的情况和很多人一样：每年有数十万移民申请数量有限的H-1B签证，绝大多数人不成功。 戴维·郑是中国公民，他来到美国接受高等教育，于2021年获得计算机科学硕士学位。他想留在美国，在他的领域工作，但时间不多了：他的教育签证只允许他毕业后在美国工作三年。 今年7月，在继续全职工作的同时，他开始读另一个研究生学位，以保持合法身份。 “有时候我会想，美国到底需不需要我们这样的人，”他告诉我。 几十年来，美国一直是中国年轻人寻求教育机会的首选。在新冠疫情之前，他们当中大约80%的人最终回到中国，因为他们的国家提供了更多的机会。现在，许多人想留下来，因为在他们的祖国，政府变得越来越专制，国家的经济摇摇欲坠，就业市场黯淡。 但是，美国移民程序难以预测，往往旷日持久，再加上中美关系恶化，许多人陷入了困境。我采访了六名中国移民，并与其他几个试图获得签证以在美国扎根的人互发了信息。他们用“地狱”和“噩梦”这样的词语描述了他们令人烦恼、有时甚至是创伤性的经历。 我采访的一些人要求只透露姓名的一部分，因为害怕遭到中国的报复，或者担心在本文中发声会在签证过程中给他们带来麻烦。不少人表示，事后看来，他们可能应该选择加拿大或其他永久居留权和公民身份的获取途径更清晰的国家。 移民一直是今年美国总统大选的热门话题，大部分注意力都集中在非法穿越南部边境的人群上。很少有人讨论合法移民必须面对的这个支离破碎的系统。关于如何吸引世界各地最有才华的移民，也没有太多讨论。 美国是一个由移民建立起来的国家，它代表着自由、机会甚至财富，是一个人们可以成就理想的地方，但是对于那些渴望成为它的一部分人来说，它已经成为一个令人生畏且代价高昂的目的地。我知道美国面临着许多挑战。然而，在许多饱受战争、饥荒和专制政府折磨的地方，美国的政府制度和言论自由原则备受尊崇。 H-1B签证是法律、技术、医药以及学术等许多行业领域有意移民者的入境卡。 但就像买彩票一样，获得H-1B签证也是一场赌博。美国政府每年发放8.5万个H-1B工作签证。在2023财年，登记人数为48万；在2024财年，这一数字为78万。印度人通常占申请人数的四分之三左右，其次是中国人，约占八分之一。 一般来说，外国大学毕业生如果是人文专业，可以在美国合法工作一年，如果是科学技术专业，可以合法工作三年。 为了这渺茫的机会，一些中国H-1B申请人求神拜佛。还有人在一家中式点心连锁餐厅用餐，因为它的中文名字是“添好运”。有些人在Chick-fil-A（福来鸡）餐厅用餐时祈祷，因为华人社区传说，这样做会有帮助。 魏女士（音）就是这样一位祈祷者，她要求我只使用她的姓氏。魏女士去过纽约和加州的寺庙。“我去拜菩萨的那一天就说”她告诉我。“，我在几月几号要抽H-1B了！请保佑我！我真的很想留在美国，我不想回到中国去！” 2023年3月她第一次申请签证时，祈祷没有奏效，她被拒签了。四个月后，在她前往加州一座寺庙的第二天，她收到了第二次申请的批准通知。 魏女士说，她在2021年移民美国，因为中国让她感到窒息。她说她曾经为性别不平等和其他问题大声疾呼。她在社交媒体平台微博上的大约10个账号被审查人员删除了。在家里，父母告诉她不要谈论社会和政治问题。 “即使生活上好像没有任何的困苦，但我会觉得生活没有任何的希望、没有盼头，”她说。“每天好像行尸走肉一样。” 现在，魏女士在硅谷一家金融公司的市场部工作。她的理想是为一个倡导人权和妇女权利的组织工作，但她的工作选择仅限于为她提供签证担保的雇主。 “我被美国的自由所吸引，但到了之后，我意识到自由只属于公民，”她说。“给外国人的自由非常有限。” 另一名移民安德里亚·顾（音）十年前从中国来到这里学习计算机科学。作为LGBTQ群体的一员，她相信美国是一个比中国友好得多的地方。她从来没有想到，为了在她的第二故乡合法地生活和工作，她会经历怎样的磨难。 她的第一次H-1B申请被拒绝了。第二次申请获批后，她回到中国，在美国领事馆激活了签证。那是在2020年初。大流行及其给旅行带来的诸多麻烦使她留在了中国。在美国驻上海领事馆签证面试的前一天晚上，她非常紧张，一直哭到凌晨3点。后来她拿到了签证，搬到了纽约。 但她艰难的旅程仍在继续。她申请了永久居留权，但被拒绝了，因为她的律师在表格上犯了一个小错误。然后，在2022年，她的公司开始裁员。她保住了工作，但被焦虑所困扰。被解雇的H-1B签证持有人必须在60天内找到另一个雇主来担保他们的签证，否则就必须离开美国。 “我来到美国是因为我希望有自由，希望活得更好，”她告诉我。“但是来到这个地方甚至都没有办法回国，也没办法换一个工作、出国旅游。” 对我采访过的人来说，被这个程序所困是一种常见的经历。 正在攻读第二个硕士学位的计算机科学专业学生戴维·郑自2018年以来就没有看望过他在中国的家人。随着两国关系的恶化，他听过太多人们再入境美国时遇到困难的恐怖故事。他的女友也是中国移民，由于未能获得工作签证，雇主在7月份将她调到了英国。两人之间现在隔着一座大西洋。作为中国护照持有者，他们如果想去探望对方，需要越过重重障碍。 戴维·郑想念她，她也想念他，还有她在美国的朋友们。 “毕竟生活了八年了，身份上不能把这称为家，”他说。“心里多少还是觉得这是家吧。” 袁莉 为《纽约时报》撰写“ 新新世界 ”专栏，专注中国及亚洲科技、商业和政治交叉议题。 点击查看更多关于她的信息。 翻译：纽约时报中文网 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "link": "https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20240913/south-korea-deepfake-videos/dual",
    "description": "首尔上周爆发了反对深度伪造的色情内容的抗议活动。 Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images 2020年，当韩国政府追查一个强迫年轻女性为付费观众拍摄露骨色情视频的 勒索团伙 时，他们在社交媒体的黑暗角落里发现了其他东西：经过粗略加工的色情图片，上面贴着其他人的面孔。 他们不知道如何处理这些深度伪造色情内容的早期尝试。最后，韩国国会颁布了一项措辞模糊的法律，禁止制作、传播这类内容。但这未能阻止一个使用人工智能技术的犯罪浪潮的出现，该浪潮现已将韩国 网络厌女文化 推到了登峰造极的程度。 在过去的两周里，韩国人震惊地发现，越来越多的年轻男性和十几岁的男孩在社交媒体上获取同学、老师和军队同僚的大量照片，而且几乎都是年轻女性和女孩，包括未成年女孩的照片，然后借助深度伪造应用程序，用这些照片来制作性剥削图片和视频片段。 他们通过加密短信服务平台Telegram的聊天室来传播这些内容，有些聊天室的成员多达22万。这些深度伪造的内容通常将受害者的面孔贴在摆出露骨性姿态身体的图片上，后者来自淫秽作品。调查人员说，伪造照片的技术如此之先进，以至于普通人常常很难分辨出它们是假的。随着韩国迅速采取措施努力应对这一威胁，专家们已指出，韩国人对新技术的热情有时会超过对其道德影响的担忧。 但对许多女性来说，这些深度伪造只是她们国家根深蒂固的厌女文化在网上的最新表现，这种文化现在培养出了认为在网上分享羞辱女性的色情图片很有趣的年轻男性。 “韩国社会不把女性当做同胞，”大学生李宥真（音）说，她在读的大学是数百所学生成为受害者的中学、高中和大学之一。她质问政府为什么没有在“窃用朋友的照片，用其来进行性羞辱已成为一种数字文化”之前采取更多行动。 虽然网络上的性暴力是一个日益严重的全球问题，但这个问题在韩国尤为突出。韩国能否以及如何成功地解决深度伪造问题，将受到其他国家的政策制定者、学校官员和执法部门的关注。 政府官员柳熙林（音）上个月在首尔召开的有关深度伪造的紧急会议上。韩国总统已对有关深度伪造的新闻报道作出回应，下令政府“将其根除”。 Yonhap, via EPA, via Shutterstock 韩国社会的性犯罪阴暗面偶尔会浮出水面。一名已 被定罪 的韩国人曾经营着世界上最大的儿童性虐待图片网站之一。 一名韩国流行艺人 因在夜总会协助卖淫而被定罪。多年来，韩国警方一直在打击 偷拍色情片 的犯罪活动。2020年对那个勒索网的调查已导致其主犯被判处40年有期徒刑，该人曾引诱年轻女性（包括十几岁的女孩）拍摄视频，然后通过Telegram的聊天室在线销售。 易于使用的深度伪造技术的兴起为这种形式的性暴力增添了隐蔽而危险的维度：受害者往往不知道自己是受害者，直到收到匿名者发来的短信或警方打来的电话。 “奴隶”、“厕所”、“抹布” 对一名30岁的深度伪造受害者（为了保护她的隐私，这里不用她的姓名）来说，这种攻击始于2021年，她先是在Telegram上收到匿名者发来的一条短信：“嗨！” 在接下来的几个小时里，她收到了源源不断的淫秽短信，还有深度伪造的图片和视频片段，其中的头像取自她在社交媒体上发的家庭旅行照片。图片和视频中的身体上写着“奴隶”、“厕所”和“抹布”等字眼。 今年4月，她从警方得知，她在首尔国立大学读书时的两名前同学在被拘留者之列。从这所名牌大学毕业的男生伙同他人用深度伪造技术制作色情内容，攻击了数十名女性，其中包括十几名从首尔国立大学毕业的女生。上个月，被拘留的一名男子被判处五年有期徒刑。 “除了我是女性外，我想不出他们这样对待我的原因，”她说。“身边有像他们这样的人，这个事实让我对人类失去了信心。” 她说，自从那次攻击发生以来，她一直在与心理创伤作斗争。每当她在智能手机上收到短信通知或匿名电话时，她的心跳就会加速。 向世界各地出口流行文化的韩国已成为最容易受深度伪造的色情内容伤害的国家。据美国网络安全公司Security Hero发布的《 2023年深度伪造现状 》研究报告，全球一半以上的深度伪造将韩国人作为攻击目标，其中大多数受害者是韩国歌手和女演员。主要的韩国流行音乐经纪公司已向深度伪造内容宣战，称他们正在收集证据，并威胁对深度伪造内容的创作者和传播者提起诉讼。 尽管如此，问题仍在加剧。韩国警方已在今年1月至7月通报了297起涉及深度伪造的性犯罪案，而在首次收集此类数据的2021年，全年只通报了156起这种案件。 直到上个月，韩国新闻媒体曝光了Telegram上流传着大量深度伪造内容后，尹锡悦总统才下令政府“根除它们”。尹锡悦的批评者指出，他在2022年竞选总统期间曾否认韩国存在结构性的性别歧视，还承诺要废除性别平等部。 有关深度伪造内容今年激增的新闻报道已在年轻女性中引起恐慌，她们中的许多人已将自拍照和其他的个人图片从社交媒体账号删除，担心这些图片会被人用去制作深度伪造内容。上个月出任首尔市教育厅厅长的郑晋权（音）曾是一所中学的校长。他说，他以前的学校已讨论了是否不再把学生照片放入学校年刊的问题。 “有些老师已经拒绝将自己的照片放入学校年刊，而是用画像代替，”郑先生说。 韩国是世界上互联网最为普及的国家之一，韩国年轻人从小就精通技术。但批评人士称，韩国的教育制度过于关注为学生参加至关重要的大学入学考试做准备，没有教他们如何用道德的方式使用新技术。 “我们的学校生产的是会解考题的机器，”郑先生说。“他们不学习价值观。” 推动制定更严格的法律 首尔市官员金智玄（音）的团队自2019年以来已为200名受数字性剥削牵连的青少年做心理辅导。她说，一些男孩曾使用深度伪造来报复前女友，还有些情况是，女孩使用这种技术来排挤同学。但金女士说，许多年轻人最初受深度伪造技术吸引是出于好奇。 对于许多韩国女性来说，深度伪造只是韩国根深蒂固的厌女文化在网上的最新体现。 Ahn Young-Joon/Associated Press 运作聊天室的人用星巴克优惠券等奖励来吸引他们，让他们提供认识的女性的照片和个人数据。韩国政府资助的妇女人权研究所的团队负责人朴成惠（音）说，一些被称为“强奸和羞辱室”的Telegram频道专门针对来自某些学校的个人或女性，朴成惠曾调查过数字性犯罪案，为受害者提供过帮助。 根据2020年颁布的法律，出于传播目的而制作露骨色情或虐待性深度伪造视频的人最高可被判处五年有期徒刑。那些试图通过传播这些内容来获取经济利益的人最高可被判处七年有期徒刑。但没有法律禁止购买、存储或观看深度伪造的内容。 调查人员需要获得法院批准才能用秘密身份进入深度伪造聊天室，而且，他们只是在收到未成年人遭到性虐待的举报后才能进行这类调查。这个过程也可能很慢。 “你在假期发现了一个聊天室，但等你得到法院批准后，它已经消失了，”国家警察局网络犯罪高级调查员咸永玉（音）说。 政府已承诺推动制定更严格的法律，禁止购买或观看性剥削性的深度伪造视频。本月，调查最新一轮深度伪造事件的警方称，他们 已拘留了七名男性嫌疑人 ，其中六人是青少年。 色情内容在韩国互联网上受到审查，但用户能通过VPN绕过审查，而且很难在社交媒体渠道执行禁止色情内容的法律。警方已表示，他们 可能会调查Telegram是否怂恿了 深度伪造的性犯罪行为。上个月，Telegram创始人帕维尔·杜罗夫在法国被捕，并被指控犯有一系列罪行，包括传播儿童性虐待材料。 Telegram在一份声明中表示，“一直在积极删除韩国报告的违反平台服务条款的内容，并将继续这样做。” 与此同时，韩国政府正面临着迫使网络平台采取更多措施过滤内容的压力，比如深度伪造的色情。 “是保护平台，还是保护我们的儿童和青少年，是时候在两者之间做出选择了，”京畿大学法医心理学教授李邵宗（音）说。“我们在2024年看到正在发生的事，在2020年就已经有了预兆，但我们在这期间什么都没做。” Choe Sang-Hun是时报驻首尔首席记者，报道韩国和朝鲜新闻。 点击查看更多关于他的信息。 翻译：Cindy Hao 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "link": "https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20240913/china-retirement-age/dual",
    "description": "在北京一个公园里下棋的老人。中国周五表示将逐步提高法定退休年龄。 Jade Gao/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Chinese government on Friday approved a plan to raise the country’s statutory retirement age, currently among the lowest in the world, in a long-awaited but broadly unpopular effort to address the challenge of its rapidly aging population . 中国政府周五批准了一项提高法定退休年龄的计划，这是一项期待已久却不受欢迎的举措，旨在应对人口 快速老龄化 的挑战。该国当前的法定退休年龄位居全球最低之列。 This is the first time China has raised its retirement age since the 1950s. It will be phased in gradually, starting on Jan. 1, 2025. The retirement age for men, previously 60, will increase in increments of several months before finally reaching 63 by 2040. The retirement age for women in white-collar jobs, previously 55, will rise to 58. Women in blue-collar jobs, who previously could retire at 50, will have to work until 55. 这是中国自上世纪五十年代以来首次提高退休年龄，将从2025年1月1日开始分阶段提高退休年龄。男性退休年龄此前为60岁，明年起将以几个月为单位递增，最终在2040年达到63岁。白领女性（干部岗位）的退休年龄此前为55岁，将提高至58岁。蓝领女性（工人岗位）此前可在50岁退休，未来将不得不工作到55岁。 The decision would “maintain the momentum and vitality of economic and social development,” Wang Xiaoping, China’s Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said at a news conference. 中国人力资源社会保障部部长王晓萍在新闻发布会上表示，这一决定将“保持经济社会发展的动力和活力”。 Policymakers and experts have for decades been calling for a change to the retirement age, noting that the previous rules dated from a time when life expectancy in China was much shorter, and fertility rates higher. They warned that maintaining the status quo would severely strain the country’s work force and pension funds, with large numbers of older Chinese retiring but fewer young people replacing them. 几十年来，政策制定者和专家们一直呼吁改变退休年龄，并指出此前的规定是在中国人的预期寿命短得多，且生育率较高的时代制定的。他们警告，维持此前退休年龄的规定将严重影响中国的劳动力和养老金，因为大量老年人退休，而接替他们的年轻人却越来越少。 China’s working-age population has been falling since 2012, according to official statistics , with an average annual decrease of more than 3 million people. Last year, China had 297 million people over 60 years old, or about 21 percent of its population. 据 官方统计数据 ，自2012年以来，中国劳动年龄人口持续下降，平均每年减少300万人以上。去年，中国60岁以上人口为2.97亿，约占总人口的21%。 But the proposal faced broad opposition , from older workers as well as from younger ones, who worried that an expanded work force would mean even tougher competition for jobs. China also lacks a strong social safety net, and age discrimination by employers is common, leaving many blue-collar workers to worry that they would be left without work but unable to draw on pensions. 但延迟退休年龄的提议遭到了 广泛反对 ，包括年长和年轻的劳动者，他们担心劳动力队伍扩大意味着就业竞争变得更加激烈。中国还缺乏强大的社会保障体系，雇主普遍存在 年龄歧视 ，这让许多蓝领劳动者担心自己会失业，但又无法领取养老金。 In a sign of how sensitive the issue was, the government has promised before to raise the retirement age, only to backpedal in the face of public outcry. 政府此前曾承诺提高退休年龄，但面对公众的强烈抗议又撤回了这一承诺。该问题的敏感性由此可见一斑。 In some ways, now is a particularly bad time for the government to follow through. China’s economy is still struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Youth unemployment remains high . Local governments, which administer pensions and other government benefits, have already cut back on payouts in recent years — at times setting off protests . 从某种程度上来说，现在延迟退休年龄对政府来说是一个很糟糕的时机。 中国经济 仍在举步维艰地试图从疫情中恢复。青年失业率 仍然很高 。负责管理养老金和其他政府福利的地方政府近年来已经削减了养老金支出——有时甚至 引发了抗议 。 But the government most likely realized it had no more time to delay, said Alfred Wu, a professor of public policy at the National University of Singapore, who noted that he was surprised by the speed with which the government had ultimately made its move. (The legislature had announced earlier this week that it was reviewing a draft law, and there was no public comment period as is common for many laws.) 但新加坡国立大学公共政策学教授吴木銮表示，政府很可能意识到已经没有时间可以拖延了。他指出，政府最终采取行动的速度令他感到惊讶。（立法机构本周早些时候宣布正在审查一项法律草案，该草案没有像很多法案一样设置公众意见征询期。） “I think China has lost a lot of golden opportunities” to make the decision more palatable to the public, Professor Wu said. “Maybe another way is just to release it. Let people accept it, and they move forward.” “我认为中国已经失去了很多让公众更容易接受这一决定的黄金机会，”吴教授说。“也许另一种方式就是直接公布决定。让人们接受它，然后就这样了。” Acceptance did not seem to be the initial public reaction. 接受看起来并不是公众的第一反应。 On Chinese social media, where several hashtags about the decision led the trending topics, users complained that they would have to wait even longer to receive benefits that they decried as too low anyway. 在中国的社交媒体上，有关这一决定的几个标签成为热门话题，网友抱怨，他们不得不等待更长的时间才能领取他们认为本来就太低的养老金。 Others worried that the pension funds would be even more depleted by the time they finally got to retire. The government-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has previously projected that China’s pension funds would run out of money by 2035. 还有人担心，到他们最终退休时，养老金将面临枯竭。由政府支持的中国社会科学院曾预测，中国的养老基金将在2035年耗尽。 The decision announced Friday will also lengthen the time people must pay into pension funds before becoming eligible to receive a monthly pension, to 20 years from 15. 周五宣布的决定还将延长人们在有资格每月领取养老金之前必须向养老基金缴费的时间，从15年延长至20年。 In an apparent effort to ease people’s concerns, the plan included what it described as a flexible option for people to retire up to three years earlier — that is, at the current retirement age — if they had fulfilled the 20-year contribution requirement. 显然为了缓解人们的担忧，该计划还包括一个所谓的弹性选择，即如果人们达到了20年的缴费要求，他们可以提前最多三年退休，也就是在目前的退休年龄退休。 “The decision reflects respect for individual wishes. It does not force everyone to reach the new statutory retirement age,” Xinhua, the official news agency, quoted a professor at Zhejiang University, Jin Weigang, as saying. “决定体现了对个人意愿的尊重，不强制要求每个人必须达到新的法定退休年龄才能退休，”官方通讯社新华社援引浙江大学教授金维刚的话说。 The raising of the retirement age by three years for most workers was less than the five years many had expected. 大多数工人的退休年龄推迟了三年，少于许多人预期的五年。 The government also promised to improve the system for paid annual leave, fight age discrimination and offer earlier retirement for workers in physically demanding jobs. 政府还承诺完善带薪年假制度，防范治理年龄歧视，并为从事体力要求高的职业的工人提供提前退休的机会。 And it said it would work to establish universal child care — another step that could be crucial for ensuring that the delayed retirement age does not inadvertently worsen the population aging problem, by discouraging people from having children. Currently, many retirees take primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren. 政府还表示将努力建立普惠托育服务——这对于确保延迟退休年龄不会因导致人们不愿生育，从而无意中加剧人口老龄化的问题至关重要。目前，许多退休人员承担着抚养孙辈的主要责任。 Besides those reassurances, the government also had another tool to ensure that public backlash did not spiral out of control: censorship. 除了这些保证之外，政府还有另一个工具来确保公众的反弹不会失控：审查。 On Chinese social media, major state media outlets controlled which comments on their posts about the news could be seen. “Got it,” said one of the top comments under a post by the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece. 在中国的社交媒体上，主要的官方媒体控制着相关新闻的评论区。共产党喉舌《人民日报》的一篇帖子下的热门评论之一是：“了解。” 王月眉(Vivian Wang)是《纽约时报》驻华记者，常驻北京，撰写关于中国的崛起及野心如何塑造普通人日常生活的报道。 点击查看更多关于她的信息。 翻译：纽约时报中文网 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "description": "泰勒·斯威夫特公开宣布自己会把票投给谁，但这是否会影响选情？ Andre Dias Nobre/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images To some Americans, the biggest news to come out of the presidential debate Tuesday night was not Kamala Harris’s well-received performance. It was Taylor Swift’s endorsement of her minutes after the debate ended. 对一些美国人来说，周二晚上总统辩论的最大新闻并非贺锦丽 广受好评 的表现。而是泰勒·斯威夫特在辩论结束几分钟后公开表态对她的 支持 。 As celebrity endorsements go, there may not be a bigger one. But could it actually influence the race? 恐怕不会有比这更重大的名人背书了。但这真的能影响到选举结果吗？ There’s no doubt that Ms. Swift has sway with her legions of fans. There were a total of 405,999 visits to Vote.gov through the link on Ms. Swift’s Instagram story in the 24 hours it was live, far more than the site’s daily average of 30,000 in early September, according to a General Services Administration spokesperson. 毫无疑问，斯威夫特在她的众多粉丝当中拥有巨大的影响力。根据总务管理局发言人的说法，斯威夫特在Instagram故事中提供的链接在24小时内为Vote.gov网站引来了40.5999万次访问，远超该网站在9月初日均3万的数量。 But that number alone isn’t particularly useful. It doesn’t tell us whether the visitors were new voters, whether those visits translated into actual registrations or what any new voters will do on Nov. 5. 但仅仅是这个数字并没有太大意义。它并不能告诉我们这些访问者是否是新选民，这些访问是否转化为实际的登记，或者任何新选民在11月5日会把票投给谁。 The reality is that it’s impossible to know exactly how much of a difference — if any — Ms. Swift will make. But here are some ways to think about the question, after looking at research and speaking with college-age Swift fans in Pennsylvania after the debate. 现实情况是，我们无法确切知道斯威夫特会带来多大的变化——如果有的话。但在辩论结束后，在查阅了相关研究并与宾夕法尼亚州处在大学年龄的斯威夫特粉丝交谈后，我们找到了一些思考这个问题的角度。 What the research says 相关研究是怎么说的 There are lots of studies on celebrity endorsements, but the evidence that they matter is mixed. And even if they do matter (they are still sought after and welcomed), the actual effects are very hard to measure. 关于名人背书的研究有很多，但并没有格外有力的证据能证明名人背书的重要性。即使这种背书确实有用（竞选中仍然迫切需要和欢迎这样的支持），实际效果也很难衡量。 But researchers have tried. 但研究人员对此做过尝试。 After Oprah Winfrey endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, researchers analyzed Oprah Magazine subscription data, book sales and election results to see if Mr. Obama performed better than expected in places where people subscribed to the magazine or where books recommended by Oprah’s Book Club sold particularly well (after controlling for various demographics like race, age, education and more). They found that he did, and concluded that Ms. Winfrey’s endorsement resulted in an additional one million votes for Mr. Obama in the primary, out of more than 30 million votes cast. 奥普拉·温弗瑞在2008年民主党初选中 公开表态支持 奥巴马之后，研究人员分析了《奥普拉杂志》的订阅数据、图书销售和选举结果，以确定奥巴马在订阅该杂志的地方，或者在奥普拉读书俱乐部推荐的书籍卖得特别好的地方（在对种族、年龄、教育等各种人口统计变量进行控制后)，是否表现得比预期好。他们发现的确如此，并得出结论，温弗瑞的 支持 让奥巴马在 初选中多获得了100万张选票，投票总数为3000多万张。 But this example may only take us so far. Researchers at Miami University in Ohio and California State Long Beach found that celebrity endorsements are more likely to matter in primary elections, when voters must choose between two or more relatively similar candidates. In these situations — when voters don’t really have a strong view one way or another — the voice of a trusted celebrity can play an important role. 然而，此例可能适用范围有限。俄亥俄州迈阿密大学和加州州立大学长滩分校的研究人员 发现 ，名人背书在初选中的影响可能更大，即选民必须在两个或多个相对类似的候选人之间做出选择。在这种情况下——当选民没有强烈的倾向时——一个值得信赖的名人的声音可以发挥重要作用。 In general elections, partisanship is what drives voters’ choices; political attitudes often form early in life and are unlikely to be changed by a celebrity endorsement. In 2016, Hillary Clinton received endorsements from Beyoncé, Jay-Z , LeBron James , Kendall Jenner , George Clooney and dozens of others . She still lost. 在大选中，党派之争是推动选民选择的因素；政治态度通常在 很小 就形成了，不太可能因为名人背书而改变。在2016年，希拉里·克林顿得到了 碧昂丝 、 Jay-Z 、 勒布朗·詹姆斯 、 肯达尔·詹纳 、 乔治·克鲁尼 等 许多人 的公开支持。她最后还是输了。 Could Swift’s endorsement be a special case? 斯威夫特的背书会不会是一个特例？ Vice President Harris is not a typical general election candidate, having entered the race less than two months ago. In a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, 28 percent of likely voters said they still needed to learn more about her. Only 9 percent of likely voters felt the same way about Mr. Trump. If celebrity endorsements do have a larger effect when voters don’t have a strong view of the candidate, Ms. Harris could benefit from being relatively unknown. 作为一名总统大选候选人，副总统贺锦丽的情况并非典型，她不到两个月前才参加竞选。在《纽约时报》和锡耶纳学院最近的一项民调中，28%的潜在选民表示，他们仍需要更多地 了解 她。只有9%的潜在选民对特朗普有同样的看法。当选民对候选人没有强烈偏向的情况下，名人的支持确实会产生更大的影响，那么贺锦丽可能会因为相对不为人知而受益。 There’s also the question of who might be most receptive to Ms. Swift’s message. 还有一个问题是，谁可能对斯威夫特的信息最具接受度。 Although her supporters are more likely to be Democrats (according to a recent YouGov poll) she is popular enough that she has support across the political spectrum. About a third of voters who didn’t support either Mr. Trump or Ms. Harris said they liked her. It’s possible some of those voters — a sliver, to be sure — may be swayed by the endorsement. 尽管斯威夫特的支持者更有可能是民主党人（根据YouGov 最近 所做的民调），但她的受欢迎程度足以让她得到 各政治派别的支持。在不支持特朗普或贺锦丽的选民中，大约有三分之一的人表示喜欢她。这些选民中的一些人——可以肯定的是一小部分——可能会受到其背书的影响。 The fact that partisanship forms in one’s youth could be another argument for a Swift effect. In the YouGov poll, the youngest respondents were the most likely to say they were big Swift fans. 党派倾向在青少年时期形成的事实，可能是另一个支持斯威夫特效应的论点。在YouGov所做的民调中，最年轻的受访者最有可能说自己是斯威夫特的忠实粉丝。 “Young voters don’t trust a lot of institutions, they don’t trust a lot of traditional leaders, they do trust the people that they idolize,” said E. Michele Ramsey , an associate professor of communication arts and sciences at Penn State Berks who teaches a class on Ms. Swift. “Our idols are people that we want to emulate.” “年轻选民对许多机构不信任，对许多传统领导者不信任，但他们信任那些他们崇拜的人，”宾州州立大学伯克分校传播艺术与科学副教授 E·米歇尔·拉姆齐 表示，她开有一门关于斯威夫特的课程。“我们的偶像是我们想要效仿的人。” Several students we spoke to reflected this idea. 我们采访的几位学生都表达了这个观点。 Buse Onat, 20, a junior at the University of Scranton and an undecided voter, grew up listening to Ms. Swift’s music. She sees her as “a really important figure” in her life. To Ms. Onat, who doesn’t follow politics closely, “having someone else endorse this, kind of shows you: I don’t fully understand this, but this person does.” 20岁的布斯·奥纳特是斯克兰顿大学的大三学生，也是一位尚未决定把票投给谁的选民，她听着斯威夫特的歌长大。她将其视为自己生活中“一个非常重要的人物”。对于不太关注政治的奥纳特来说，“他人的背书某种程度上向你表明：我虽然不完全理解这件事，但这个人理解。” Grace Miller, 22, a senior at Kutztown University, grew up in a Republican household. But Ms. Swift’s endorsement has made her more confident in her own favorable opinion of Ms. Harris. If Ms. Swift is “not scared to support someone, it kind of makes it seem like maybe she is the better option,” she said. 22岁的格蕾丝·米勒是库茨敦大学的大四生，在一个共和党家庭长大。但斯威夫特的背书让她对贺锦丽的好感变得更有信心了。她说：“如果斯威夫特‘不害怕支持某个人，那就会让人觉得她可能是更好的选择’。” In the YouGov poll, 8 percent of respondents said her endorsement would make them more likely to support Ms. Swift’s favored candidate. Most said it wouldn’t. 在YouGov的民调中，8%的受访者表示她的背书会让他们更有可能支持斯威夫特青睐的候选人。大多数人则表示不会。 Lillian Morales, a freshman at Penn State Berks, plans to vote for Ms. Harris and said Ms. Swift’s endorsement was never going to influence her ultimate decision. “It’s really not my business to know who someone is voting for,” she said. “And if she wants to express who she’s voting for, then that’s on her.” 宾夕法尼亚州立大学伯克斯分校的大一新生莉莉安·莫拉莱斯计划投票给贺锦丽，她说斯威夫特的背书永远不会影响她的最终决定。“我真的不关心别人把票投给谁，”她说。“如果她想表达自己投票给谁，那是她的事。” If anything, the Swift fan base was already politically organized before the endorsement. Swifties for Kamala formed the day President Biden dropped out of the race. A single Instagram post may not do much to mobilize Swift voters any more than they already are. 如果说有什么不同的话，斯威夫特的粉丝群在她背书之前就已经在政治上组织起来了。“ 霉粉挺卡玛拉 ”(Swifties for Kamala)在拜登总统退选那一天 成立。一个Instagram帖子不见得给斯威夫特粉丝中的选民带来更多的动员。 Swifties for Kamala “fully expected this statement to come,” said Erin L. Rossiter , an assistant professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame. “Now that they have this endorsement, it legitimizes what they’re doing so they can be more powerful in their organizing” — even if the groundwork was already laid. 支持贺锦丽的霉粉“对这份声明的到来毫不意外 ”，圣母大学政治学助理教授 艾琳·罗西特 说。“现在他们得到了这份背书，这就使他们所做的事情更加理直气壮了，这样他们在组织工作中变得更有气势”——即使基础已经打好了。 What about enthusiasm? 那么投票热情方面呢？ Does this mean that any impact of the Swift endorsement will be less about changing minds, and more about increasing turnout? 这是否意味着斯威夫特的背书更多的不是改变人民的想法，而是增加投票率？ Young voters are typically much less likely to vote than older voters. In a close election, if Ms. Swift’s endorsement persuaded even a small portion of Democratic-aligned potential voters to register and cast a ballot, it could make a difference. 与老年选民相比，年轻选民投票的可能性通常要小得多。在一场势均力敌的选举中，如果斯威夫特的背书能说服哪怕是一小部分支持民主党的潜在选民登记并投票，就可能会产生不同的结果。 Then again, if it did, we wouldn’t necessarily know it: If Ms. Harris sees a bump in polling data or voter registrations, it will be hard to tell whether it comes from Ms. Swift’s endorsement, a strong debate performance or something else altogether. 话又说回来，即便如此，我们也不一定知道：如果贺锦丽的民调数据或选民登记数据有所上升，究竟是来自斯威夫特的背书，优秀的辩论表现，还是别的什么原因。 The endorsement may also have other, less visible downstream effects. It may help with fund-raising or lead to more favorable media coverage. 背书也可能带来其他并不那么明显的影响。它可能有助于筹款，或带来更有利的媒体报道。 Campaigns need excitement, but it’s not always easy to gauge . If it has felt to you that a lot of this year’s election cycle has risen and fallen on vibes , you’re not alone. On Tuesday night, the Harris/Walz campaign rushed to offer Swift-inspired friendship bracelets on its website. They sold out in less than 24 hours. 竞选活动需要兴奋的情绪 ，但这并不总是那么容易 衡量 。如果你已经感觉到今年的选举周期在 氛围 上起起落落， 很多人跟你想的一样。周二晚上，贺锦丽和沃尔兹的竞选团队在其网站上匆忙推出了受斯威夫特启发的友谊手链。不到24小时已经销售一空。 Ronda Kaysen是《纽约时报》房产记者，撰写楼市和社会的交叉议题。 点击查看更多关于她的信息。 翻译：杜然 点击查看本文英文版。 https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/upshot/taylor-swift-endorsement-harris-election.html",

    "description": "几个月前违禁药物检测结果呈阳性的中国游泳运动员被允许参加2021年东京奥运会。 Oli Scarff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The World Anti-Doping Agency’s executive board on Thursday eagerly embraced a report that validated its decision to clear 23 elite Chinese swimmers of doping, even as the report’s author pointed out Chinese officials had violated established rules in their handling of the incident. 世界反兴奋剂机构执委会周四急切地认可了一份报告，该报告确认该机构洗脱23名中国优秀游泳运动员兴奋剂指控的决定是正确的，尽管报告作者指出，中国官员在处理该事件时违反了既定规则。 The final report , written by a Swiss prosecutor, Eric Cottier, who was handpicked by WADA, effectively absolved the global antidoping regulator of wrongdoing in its handling of the Chinese case, which had drawn scorn from Olympic athletes, prompted skepticism from global antidoping experts and sparked a bitter feud with the Biden administration. 最终报告 由世界反兴奋剂机构 （简称WADA）钦点的瑞士检察官埃里克·科蒂埃撰写，实际上 认定全球反兴奋剂监管机构在处理中国兴奋剂案时不存在不当行为 。WADA的处理方式曾招致奥运会运动员的蔑视，引发全球反兴奋剂专家的质疑以及一场与拜登政府的激烈争执。 The decision to quietly clear the athletes, without ever revealing their positive tests, had hung like a cloud over the pool deck at the Paris Olympics and raised broader concerns over the efficacy of the global antidoping system. 悄悄为运动员洗脱罪名、不透露他们的兴奋剂阳性检测结果的决定 就像一片阴云 笼罩着 巴黎奥运会的游泳馆，引发了人们对全球反兴奋剂体系效力的更广泛担忧。 Mr. Cottier also concluded that there had been no bias toward China in the handling of the swimmers’ cases. And he appeared to dismiss reporting by The New York Times and other organizations that has challenged WADA’s actions in multiple so-called mass contamination events involving Chinese swimmers while simultaneously recommending that antidoping officials move to tighten their rules and processes related to such cases. 科蒂埃还得出结论，在对游泳运动员用药案件的处理上不存在 偏袒中国。他似乎对 《纽约时报》 和 其他组织 的报道 不以为然，这些报道对WADA在多起涉及中国游泳运动员的所谓大规模污染事件中的行为提出了质疑，同时建议反兴奋剂官员收紧与此类案件相关的规则和程序。 Yet the report provided no definitive conclusion to the underlying question of doping by Chinese athletes, and nothing to assuage fears of a conspiracy that continues to proliferate in elite swimming. “The sense of justice or injustice,” the report said, “goes far beyond the scope of this investigation.” 然而，报告并没有对中国运动员使用兴奋剂的根本问题给出明确的结论，也没有缓解人们对高水平游泳运动普遍存在的一种阴谋的担忧。报告称，“公正感或不公正感远远超出了本次调查的范围。” Controversy and uncertainty had hovered over the board meeting at a Turkish resort amid attempts to bar a Biden administration official who sits on the WADA board from any discussions of the Chinese case. That battle began after an anonymous complaint charged that the official, Dr. Rahul Gupta, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, had a conflict of interest because the F.B.I. has begun investigation into the swimming cases. 在土耳其一处度假胜地举行的理事会会议始终笼罩着争议和不确定性，理事会此前试图禁止拜登政府的一位官员——同时也是理事会成员—— 参与有关中国事件的任何讨论。这场斗争始于一份匿名投诉，指控美国国家药物管制政策办公室主任拉胡尔·古普塔存在 利益冲突 ，因为 美国联邦调查局已经开始调查游泳事件。 拉胡尔·古普塔博士，摄于2022年。 Sophie Park for The New York Times In the end Dr. Gupta, who is on the board as the representative of more than 40 countries in the Americas, was allowed to participate, but only after two days of tense discussions on the eve of the board meeting led to WADA leaders withdrawing the allegations against him. 作为美洲40多个国家的代表，古普塔最终被允许参加会议，但在理事会会议前夕，经过两天的紧张讨论，WADA的领导人才撤回了对他的指控。 Dr. Gupta — who arrived at the meetings with government lawyers and the head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, prepared to take up his cause — had already won the backing of the leaders of the other regional blocs. Those public bodies make up half of WADA’s board and contribute a similar amount of its funding. 与政府律师和美国反兴奋剂机构负责人特拉维斯·泰加特一同参会的古普塔准备继续他的斗争。他已经赢得了其他地区集团领导人的支持。这些公共机构占了WADA理事会的一半，提供的经费占比也差不多是一半。 The Chinese case has seriously harmed WADA’s reputation among many of its stakeholders, but the agency retains backing of the International Olympic Committee, whose representatives were involved in the talks that headed off a confrontation with the Americans at the board meeting. 中国的案件严重损害了WADA在许多利益相关者中的声誉，但该机构仍得到了国际奥委会的支持。奥委会代表参与了会前的商谈，以避免在会议上与美国人发生冲突。 The Chinese doping cases had been kept secret until April, when The Times revealed that about two dozen of China’s best swimmers had all tested positive for the same banned heart drug at a domestic meet in early 2021. The swimmers were quietly cleared of wrongdoing by Chinese investigators, who blamed their cases on a contaminated hotel kitchen. WADA accepted the Chinese version of events and did not undertake its own investigation, allowing several of them to the compete in — and win medals at — both the Tokyo and Paris Olympics. 中国的兴奋剂案件一直秘而不宣，直到今年4月，《纽约时报》 披露 ，在2021年初的一次国内比赛中，23名中国最优秀的游泳运动员对一种被禁用的心脏药物的检测均呈阳性。这些选手被悄悄认定为不存在不当行为，中国调查人员将他们的案件归咎于酒店厨房受污染。世界反兴奋剂机构接受了中国的说法，没有进行自己的调查，并允许其中几名运动员参加东京和巴黎奥运会，并获得奖牌。 Mr. Cottier had telegraphed his conclusions in the case in July, when he released an interim version of his report on the eve of the Paris Olympics that found no wrongdoing by WADA. 今年7月，科蒂埃在巴黎奥运会前夕 发布了一份临时报告 ，认定世界反兴奋剂机构没有任何不当行为。 In the final version released on Thursday, Mr. Cottier rebuked one player in the case, China’s national antidoping agency, but said its actions had no effect on his findings. “As far as the Chinese agency is concerned, it is clear that certain rules of the World Anti-Doping Code have not been applied,” he wrote. “This is regrettable, but in the end, it does not change the outcome of the cases and the acceptance of the contamination hypothesis.” 在周四公布的最终版本中，科蒂埃指责了案件中的一个参与者，即中国的国家反兴奋剂机构，但他表示，该机构的行动对他的调查结果没有影响。“就中国机构而言，很明显，《世界反兴奋剂条例》的某些规定没有得到执行，”他写道。“这令人遗憾，但最终，它不会改变案件的结果，也不会改变对污染假设的接受。” Still, parts of the 56-page report are likely to raise yet more concerns about WADA’s conduct. It found that the group’s internal investigations department “was not involved in the handling of the case” from March 2021, when the Chinese first revealed the positive tests to WADA, through to August of that year, by which time the investigation was closed. 尽管如此，这份56页的报告的部分内容可能会引发人们对WADA的更多担忧。报告发现从2021年3月中国首次向世界反兴奋剂机构透露药检结果呈阳性，到当年8月调查结束，WADA的内部调查部门“没有参与此案的处理”。 Critics like the head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, noted that Mr. Cottier’s mandate meant he had to accept “the same facts WADA accepted without doing any independent investigation.” Despite those limits, Mr. Tygart said, “This report validates the concerns we have had that WADA allowed China to have special treatment under the rules.” 美国反兴奋剂机构负责人特拉维斯·泰加特等批评人士指出，科蒂埃的任务意味着他必须接受“WADA在没有进行任何独立调查的情况下接受的事实”。尽管存在这些限制，泰加特说，“这份报告证实了我们的担忧，即世界反兴奋剂机构允许中国在规则下获得特殊待遇。” 瑞士检察官埃里克·科蒂埃今年早些时候受聘调查世界反兴奋剂机构对中国兴奋剂案件的处理。 Fabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Dr. Gupta and others were able to ask questions of Mr. Cottier on Thursday. But representatives of public bodies on the WADA board said they were unable to commit to a final position and asked for more time to study the document. 周四，古普塔和其他人可以向科蒂埃提问。但WADA理事会中的公共机构的代表表示，他们无法承诺最终立场，并要求更多时间来研究这份文件。 The publication of the report is unlikely to bring the type of closure WADA’s embattled leadership is seeking. The criminal investigation in the U.S. remains ongoing, and Congress has also been asking searching questions of the agency. Both have cited a law that grants U.S. officials the authority to criminally prosecute coaches, trainers, doctors and sports officials involved in facilitating doping, even if their actions took place outside the United States. 该报告的发布不太可能带来陷入困境的WADA 领导层所寻求的那种结案。 美国的刑事调查 仍在进行中，国会也一直在向该机构提出 尖锐的 问题。两者都援引了一项法律，该法律赋予美国官员对参与协助使用兴奋剂的教练、训练员、医生和体育官员进行 刑事起诉 的权力，即使他们的行为发生在美国境外。 That law has infuriated global sports officials, who have long feared both prosecution in the U.S. and the introduction of similar laws elsewhere. 这项法律激怒了全球体育官员，他们长期以来一直担心在美国受到起诉，也担心其他地方出台类似的法律。 The back and forth has led to the relationship between the antidoping body and the United States, its biggest backer outside of the International Olympic Committee, coming close to falling apart entirely, with officials in the U.S. publicly talking about withdrawing funding and WADA increasingly vocal in its criticism of American doping policies. 这些你来我往导致WADA与美国之间的关系几乎完全破裂，美国官员公开谈论停止提供资金，而WADA对美国兴奋剂政策的批评也越来越直接。美国是该机构在国际奥委会之外最大的支持者。 Sports officials at the meeting and board members picked by the I.O.C. have in recent days pressed WADA’s management to improve its dialogue with its American partners. The United States will host the next summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028 and a coming Winter Games in Salt Lake City in 2034. 参加会议的体育官员和国际奥委会挑选的理事会成员最近几天向WADA管理层施压，要求其改善与美国合作伙伴的对话。美国将于2028年在洛杉矶举办下一届夏季奥运会，并于2034年在盐湖城举办冬季奥运会。 At Thursday’s meeting, WADA board agreed to set up subcommittee that would turn the findings of Mr. Cottier’s report into policy changes. “This includes strengthening WADA’s internal processes,” it said in a statement. 在周四的会议上，WADA理事会同意成立一个小组委员会，将科蒂埃报告的结论转化为政策变化。该机构在一份声明中表示：“这包括加强世界反兴奋剂机构的内部流程。” Officials also discussed the need for WADA to strengthen its approach to crisis management and communication. Since the story of the Chinese tests first broke in April, WADA has repeatedly released fiery statements aimed at both the news media and persistent critics like the United States Antidoping Agency. 官员们还讨论了WADA加强危机管理和沟通方法的必要性。自今年4月中国兴奋剂检测的消息首次曝光以来，WADA多次发表措辞激烈的声明，针对新闻媒体和美国反兴奋剂机构等顽固的批评者。 That edginess was apparent in Turkey, where WADA’s director of communications, Catherine Maclean, asked that a New York Times reporter leave the luxury resort where the meeting was being held, and where a one-night stay can cost more than $1,500. 这种紧张气氛在土耳其表现得很明显。在那里，WADA的通讯主管凯瑟琳·麦克林要求《纽约时报》的一名记者离开举办会议的豪华度假村，那里的客房每晚费用可达1500美元以上。 Marcos Diaz, a former member of the WADA executive committee, expressed surprise that the news media were barred from the board meeting, explaining that even during the height of a recent Russian doping scandal there was “space for the press.” 前WADA执行委员会成员马科斯·迪亚兹对新闻媒体被禁止采访理事会会议表示惊讶，他解释说，即使在近年俄罗斯兴奋剂丑闻最严重的时候，也有“媒体的空间”。 “It will raise questions,” Mr. Diaz said. “We believe as people from public service, people from government, we must be transparent.” “这会引发问题，”迪亚兹说。“我们相信，作为公共服务部门的人，作为政府的人，我们必须做到透明。” Tariq Panja是时报全球体育记者，重点关注与体育界有关的金钱、地缘政治，以及犯罪故事。 点击查看更多关于他的信息。 Michael Schwirtz是时报国际版面调查记者。他自2006年加入时报，此前自莫斯科报道前苏联成员国新闻，他是因报道俄罗斯情报行动而获得2020年普利策奖的团队的首席记者。 点击查看更多关于他的信息。 翻译：纽约时报中文网 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "title": "「中英」众议院共和党人为何在大选前频繁对抗中国",
    "link": "https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20240913/china-congress-republicans/dual",
    "description": "中国领导人习近平本月在北京。众议院共和党人正在通过一些法案，以表明他们有决心在大选前的几个月里对抗中国日益增长的影响力。 Florence Lo/Reuters The House this week tackled a long-promised package of bills to get tough on China, but few if any have a chance of becoming law after Republicans opted to prioritize a handful of politically divisive measures that Democrats oppose. 众议院本周处理了一项承诺已久的强硬对华一揽子法案，但由于共和党人选择优先考虑一些民主党人反对的具有政治分歧的措施，这些法案几乎没有成为法律的机会。 For months, House leaders had promised a bipartisan show of force against the United States’ biggest economic and military adversary, including curtailing investments in sensitive Chinese industries, clamping down on data theft and espionage, and ensuring more Chinese imports were subject to taxes and forced labor standards. 几个月来，众议院领导人承诺，两党要向美国最大的经济和军事对手展示力量，包括削减对中国敏感行业的投资，打击数据盗窃和间谍活动，并确保更多的中国进口产品受到税收和强制劳动标准的约束。 But only some of those proposals made it to the floor this week. Instead, Republican leaders added a handful of partisan measures that appear to be aimed at portraying their party as stronger on countering China and Democrats, including the Biden administration, as weak. 但这些法案在本周只有一部分得以在众议院通过。共和党领导人转而加入了一些只有本党支持的措施，似乎是为了把共和党描绘成在对抗中国方面更强硬的党派，而把包括拜登政府在内的民主党人描绘成软弱的党派。 It comes weeks before the elections in which the White House and control of Congress are up for grabs. 几周后，两党将通过选举争夺白宫和国会的控制权。 “Because the White House has chosen not to confront China and protect America’s interests, House Republicans will,” Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, told reporters on Tuesday. “因为白宫选择不对抗中国、不保护美国的利益，众议院共和党人将挺身而出，”路易斯安那州共和党议长迈克·约翰逊周二对记者说。 Here’s a look at what the House did, and why. 以下是众议院的作为及原因。 Subjecting international pandemic agreements to Senate treaty approval. 规定国际大流行病协议应得到参议院审批。 Republicans, who have castigated the World Health Organization for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, pushed through a bill that would require Senate ratification of any W.H.O. agreement on pandemic preparedness. 一直批评世界卫生组织的新冠病毒大流行应对的共和党人，推动通过了一项法案，要求任何世卫组织关于大流行防范的协议都需要得到参议院批准。 “This is nothing more than an international power grab by leftist elitists who hate America, want to infringe upon individual privacy and seek to attack the fundamental principles of American self-governance and self-determination,” Representative Bob Good, Republican of Virginia, said during the debate. “这不过是仇恨美国、想要侵犯个人隐私、试图攻击美国自治和自决基本原则的左翼精英在进行国际层面的夺权，”弗吉尼亚州共和党众议员鲍勃·古德在辩论中说。 All but four Democrats opposed the measure, which passed by a vote of 219 to 199, arguing that the United States must work with the W.H.O. to prevent the next pandemic. 该法案以219票对199票通过，民主党人只有四人支持，其他全部反对。他们认为，美国必须与世卫组织合作，防止下一次大流行。 Reviving a defunct Trump-era initiative to curb Chinese espionage. 恢复特朗普时代启动的一个现已中止的中国间谍活动遏制行动计划。 The two parties also largely split over a measure to revive and rebrand the Justice Department’s “China Initiative,” a Trump-era program that sought to curb Chinese espionage in the United States. The Biden administration ended the program in 2022 amid complaints that it had been used unfairly to target people of Chinese descent. 两党在恢复和重塑司法部“中国行动计划”的措施上也存在很大分歧，这是特朗普时代的一个项目，旨在遏制中国在美国的间谍活动。拜登政府于2022年终止了该项目，原因是有人抱怨该项目被不公平地用于针对华裔。 Democrats argued that the program had discouraged talented Chinese engineers and researchers from moving to American companies and universities, but Republicans said there was no evidence that it had led to any bias or prejudice against people of Chinese descent. 民主党人认为，该计划阻碍了有才华的中国工程师和研究人员前往美国公司和大学，但共和党人表示，没有证据表明该计划导致了对华裔的任何偏见或成见。 The measure passed 237 to 180, with 23 Democrats and all Republicans in support. 该法案以237票对180票通过，23名民主党人和所有共和党人表示支持。 Taking aim at electric vehicle tax credits. 针对电动汽车税收抵免。 Only seven Democrats joined Republicans to support a bill to bar people who purchase electric vehicles that contain parts made or assembled by an entity of China, Russia, North Korea or Iran from receiving tax credits. 这项只有七名民主党人和全体共和党人一起支持的法案禁止含中国、俄罗斯、朝鲜或伊朗实体制造或组装零部件的电动汽车获得购买税收抵免。 Democrats argued that the measure would undermine the Biden administration’s efforts to transition the country to cleaner vehicles. 民主党人认为，这项措施将破坏拜登政府将国家过渡到更清洁汽车的努力。 Limiting Chinese ownership of farmland and university partnerships. 限制中国人拥有农田和与大学建立伙伴关系。 Dozens of Democrats broke with their party and supported Republican bills that would restrict the sale of agricultural land to foreign nationals from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, and would withhold certain federal funds from universities partnering with Beijing-backed research institutes. 数十名民主党人脱离自己的党派，转而支持共和党的法案，这些法案将限制向来自俄罗斯、中国、朝鲜和伊朗的外国人出售农业用地，此外与北京支持的研究机构合作的大学将被停止拨发部分联邦经费。 Fifty-five Democrats joined all but one Republican to endorse the farmland measure, which critics warned could lead to scapegoating immigrants. 55名民主党人，以及除一名共和党人之外的所有共和党人支持这项农田措施。批评人士警告说，这项法案可能会导致移民成为替罪羊。 “This opens the door to treating immigrants as national security threats solely because of their country of origin,” said Representative Mark Takano, Democrat of California. “这为仅仅因为移民的原籍国就将其视为国家安全威胁打开了大门，”加州民主党众议员马克·高野（音）说。 Thirty-six Democrats joined Republicans to support a measure restricting federal funding for universities that partner with Confucius Institutes, which Representative August Pfluger, Republican of Texas, charged have conducted “widespread military espionage inside the United States.” 36名民主党人与共和党人一道，支持一项限制与孔子学院合作的大学获得联邦经费的措施。得克萨斯州共和党众议员奥古斯特·弗卢格指控孔子学院“在美国境内进行了广泛的军事间谍活动”。 Narrow limits on biotechnology companies and drone equipment won broad support. 对生物技术公司和无人机设备的小范围限制赢得了广泛支持。 Lawmakers in both parties banded together on the Biosecure Act, which would bar federal support for biotechnology companies that collect Americans’ genetic data. 两党议员联合通过了《生物安全法案》，该法案将禁止联邦政府支持收集美国人基因数据的生物技术公司。 There was also unanimous support for bills to prevent the use of drone surveillance equipment produced by DJI Technologies, a Chinese manufacturer that the U.S. government has accused of conducting widespread human rights abuses and providing sensitive data to Beijing ; to prevent the purchase of Chinese-made batteries by the Department of Homeland Security; and to beef up export controls. 美国两党议员还一致支持防止使用大疆创新科技公司生产的无人机监控设备的法案—— 政府指控该公司广泛侵犯人权并向中国政府提供敏感数据 ；阻止国土安全部购买中国制造的电池；以及加强出口管制。 Republicans omitted major issues amid industry pushback and internal turf battles. 在行业阻力和内部争斗的背景下，共和党人忽略了一些重大问题。 Mr. Johnson signaled this summer that the House could tackle two ambitious measures that did not make it to the floor this week: a bill to restrict outbound investments in sensitive Chinese sectors and another to lower the price threshold at which imports from Beijing are subject to taxes and forced labor standards, known as de minimis rules. 约翰逊 今年夏天表示 ，众议院可能会处理两项雄心勃勃的措施， 但本周两项法案皆未能进入表决程序：其中一项试图限制对中国敏感行业的对外投资，另一项是降低从中国进口商品需缴纳税款和强制劳动标准的价格门槛，即所谓的最小比例原则。 The outbound investment initiative is mired in a standoff between the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Financial Services Committee about enforcement mechanisms. The legislation addressing de minimis rules has run into an onslaught of lobbying from shipping companies and retailers that generate significant revenue from cheaper Chinese goods. 众议院外交事务委员会和金融服务委员会在对外投资法案的执行机制上僵持不下。最小比例原则立法则遭遇了船运公司和零售商的猛烈游说，这些公司从更廉价的中国商品中获得了可观的收入。 “China Week is weak on China,” said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois and the ranking member of the China panel. “What’s weak about this package is what’s not in there.” “这个中国周在中国问题上很软，”伊利诺伊州民主党众议员、中国问题小组的资深成员拉贾·克里希纳莫西说。“这一揽子方案软在哪里，要看它漏掉了哪些东西。” Karoun Demirjian报道国会新闻，主要关注国防、外交政策、情报移民、贸易和科技议题。 点击查看更多关于她的信息。 翻译：纽约时报中文网 点击查看本文英文版。",

    "description": "The Backbone One is a fantastic accessory that brings a controller-like experience to mobile devices . There have been multiple iterations throughout the years , but now the company has announced a nifty-looking Xbox Edition. This could be the perfect way to finally work through that ever-burgeoning Game Pass library . First of all, this model is transparent Xbox green, which is a nice touch. It also includes a dedicated Xbox button, just like an actual gamepad. This button has multiple uses. When playing a game or in the official Xbox app, a single press opens up the Xbox Guide. Otherwise, it’ll bring up the Backbone app and show all available Xbox games. A double press starts or stops screen recording, though this is configurable to take screenshots. Holding it down while playing a game will trigger the secondary button press. Backbone Of course, it has a full suite of buttons that align with a typical Xbox controller. This allows gamers to “tap into their favorite games like Halo Infinite , Forza, and Indiana Jones” with the “precision, comfort, and reliability that Backbone is known to deliver.” The Backbone One: Xbox Edition is available right now for $110. However, folks can only pick it up from the company or via Best Buy as part of its Drops program . It will also only work with USB-C handsets, so older iPhones are a no-go. PlayStation fans already have their own Backbone One controller . That one features a traditional PlayStation layout, and it’s detected as an actual DualSense controller in the PS Remote Play app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-backbone-one-xbox-edition-controller-is-a-great-way-to-work-through-that-game-pass-library-130031268.html?src=rss",

    "description": "MEMS solid-state drivers have provided a big sound boost to wireless earbuds recently, offering the ability for companies to pack in a hybrid setup for a wider, more immersive soundstage. xMEMS&#39; silicon-based micro speakers have been a popular choice for this purpose, with the company&#39;s Cowell and Muir drivers already appearing in products from Creative Labs and others. Now, xMEMS has developed what it calls the first amplifier-less silicon tweeter for wireless earbuds in a bid to take improved sound and efficiency even further.&nbsp; Officially dubbed Lassen, the tweeter is a lower-cost option for companies. Since it doesn&#39;t require a separate piezo amplifier chip like Cowell and Muir, it&#39;s more cost effective to integrate with savings of up to 25 percent compared to the other MEMS drivers. Ditching the amp also increases power efficiency without sacrificing performance. xMEMS says that Lassen can provide up to a 115dB boost in the 6kHz to 20kHz frequency range, which it claims surpasses the output of existing tweeter tech. Plus, xMEMS promises the &quot;same superior sound quality and soundstage&quot; as its previous solid-state micro speakers.&nbsp; Like Cowell, Lassen will be used in a dual-driver or hybrid setup in wireless earbuds. When paired with a dynamic driver, for example, the MEMS tweeter boosts the high-frequency details and clarity while the dynamic driver provides the necessary low-end thump. Based on our experience with current MEMS integrations, the ability for more companies to easily implement xMEMS&#39; tech is a welcome proposition.&nbsp; xMEMS says there&#39;s also a space savings with Lassen, which is due to it rendering the amplifier chip unnecessary. The company argues that this should offer more room inside wireless earbuds for &quot;advanced technologies.&quot;&nbsp; xMEMS says samples of the Lassen tweeter are available for audio manufacturers now and it plans full production in September. This means we&#39;ll likely see products with the new component early next year, which could make the annual earbud deluge at CES very interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/a-new-mems-tweeter-for-wireless-earbuds-doesnt-require-an-amplifier-130007809.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Yes, you can save on Apple devices during the Amazon Spring Sale . One of the best Apple deals at the moment is on the latest Mac mini: the M4 desktop with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage is on sale for $499, or $100 off its usual price. You&#39;ll find the same $100 discount on other configurations as well: the 16GB/512GB model is currently going for $699 and the machine with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage sitting at $899. The M4 Mac mini earned a review score of 90 in our review this past fall, impressing us with how much power it packs into its tiny frame. Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar wrote at the time, “The Mac mini was the fastest computer I&#39;ve reviewed this year, at least when it comes to CPU benchmarks.” That it starts at 16GB of RAM (as is now standard for new Macs ) is a big plus, and in addition to the connections on the back, it has some useful front ports: two USB-C ports and a headphone jack. The M4 Mac mini’s diminutive size means you won’t have to sacrifice much desk space for it, but it’ll still be powerful enough for tasks like light video editing and some gaming. Devindra wrote that “the Mac mini impressed me by running Lies of P in 1,440p with maxed out graphics settings at 60fps,” along with Resident Evil 4 and No Man’s Sky , which “also held a steady 60 fps in 1,440p.” This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-apple-deals-include-the-m4-mac-mini-for-100-off-161156894.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Just a few days ahead of Nintendo&#39;s big Switch 2 deep dive on April 2 , the company is switching gears with an earlier surprise Direct presentation today, March 27, at 10AM ET. You can watch the stream above as it happens.&nbsp; The video will run for around 30 minutes and focus on upcoming games for the original Switch console. There won&#39;t be any Switch 2 info, but pretty much every game you see here will run on the new console anyway, thanks to backwards compatibility .&nbsp; Since this isn&#39;t billed as an Indie World Direct (those focus on indie games), it&#39;s not really clear what we can expect from this one. Nintendo&#39;s developers will largely be focused on making Switch 2 games at this point. Still, the Switch has a massive install base — the company has sold more than 150 million of those consoles — so Nintendo probably won&#39;t want to leave all those players behind any time soon.&nbsp; To that end, we can expect a stream of games for the original Switch to keep coming for the foreseeable future. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond , for instance, is still slated to hit the Switch sometime this year . Third-party games will still be coming to the Switch as well, including a certain one from Team Cherry that we expect to show up in every single gaming showcase but won&#39;t mention here because we don&#39;t want to jinx it. We&#39;ll follow up on all the big announcements as they happen. In the meantime, you can replay recent Nintendo Directs on YouTube to get you in the mood, and check out our list of best Switch games , too.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-here-at-10am-et-145809275.html?src=rss",

OpenAI has just launched a feature that will allow users to generate images directly inside of ChatGPT, and it was supposed to roll out to all Plus, Pro, Team and Free users. But according to company CEO Sam Altman , it has been way more popular than OpenAI had expected even though they already had high expectations to begin with. As such, its rollout to the free tier is &quot;unfortunately going to be delayed for a while.&quot; images in chatgpt are wayyyy more popular than we expected (and we had pretty high expectations). rollout to our free tier is unfortunately going to be delayed for awhile. — Sam Altman (@sama) March 26, 2025 People have been posting ChatGPT&#39;s output all over social media. One popular trend that emerged from the launch is turning existing photos into Studio Ghibli-style illustrations. Even Altman poked fun at it and used a Ghibli-fied photo of himself as his profile picture on X/Twitter. Users have been creating Ghibli versions of everything from personal images to photos of political figures and memes . As VentureBeat has noted, Ghibli creator Hayao Miyazaki likely wouldn&#39;t approve of them, seeing as he reacted quite negatively to AI-powered animation years ago, but we doubt that would stop the trend until people get tired of it.&nbsp; Altman didn&#39;t give a timeline for when the feature will make its way to free users.

    "title": "The best live TV streaming services to cut cable in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",
    "description": "We still think getting a live TV streaming service is a better deal than paying for cable — but the gulf between the two options is narrowing. Now that many of the major providers go for more than $80 per month, it’s not the amazing deal it once was. Still, live TV streaming plans have no contract, offer relatively simpler pricing and need no special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. There are a handful of major players and, after testing them all, we found YouTube TV to be the most well-rounded. But other services have their advantages, too, depending on what you want to watch. Here are the best live TV streaming services according to our tests. Editor’s Note : The 2025 NCAA Tournaments, aka March Madness , is currently ongoing, but since different broadcasters own the rights to each tournament, viewers won’t be able to watch every game on a single channel. The rights to men’s matchups are split between Warner Bros. Discovery and CBS. The women’s bracket is carried by ESPN. A Live TV streaming service such as YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Fubo and Sling should cover the games as they all carry the necessary channels. However, sports fans who only need access to a selection of games have cheaper alternatives available to them. Engadget’s streaming guide to March Madness details every available viewing option. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games . Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels . The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus , which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. But for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree , though we haven’t had a chance to test that one yet. Here&#39;s the best of what we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app . Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna , you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV &amp; streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations , and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max ( formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on . You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games . Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi . While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper too. While the promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year, shortly after, DirecTV announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you&#39;re an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it&#39;s more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&amp;E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you&#39;re using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on , after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV ( FAST ) including Freevee , Tubi , PlutoTV and Sling Freestream . These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel , the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV . Back to top How we tested When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town . I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen . Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024&#39;s letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million . How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials. Back to top Recent updates January 31, 2025 : Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi’s free option. Updated Fubo’s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream’s sports-only package and Comcast’s sports and news bundle. January 16, 2025 : Included higher prices for Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV’s new sports package. December 31, 2024 : Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon’s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV’s free service. August 6, 2024 : Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN&#39;s new sports-only streaming service, Venu.&nbsp; June 12, 2024 : Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.

    "description": "President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation imposing 25 percent tariffs on &quot;all cars that are not made in the United States&quot; on top of taxes that are already in place. The tariffs will apply to all imported sedans, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, cargo vans and light trucks. They will also apply to key automotive components not made in the US, including engines, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components, and they could expand to cover additional parts if necessary. The new tariffs will take effect on April 2, and the US government expects to start collecting on April 3. According to CNBC , the president assured automakers that there will be &quot;absolutely no tariff&quot; for cars made in the US. The administration is also giving automotive companies importing goods under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement time to get their US-made parts certified so that the additional taxes will only apply to the value of their non-US-made components. Trump first announced that his administration was going to impose 25 percent tariffs on automobile imports back in February. He also said at the time that the government intends to collect an additional 25 percent in taxes, or higher, on semiconductor imports.&nbsp; Trump White House aide Will Scharf said that the new automobile tariffs will earn the US &quot;over $100 billion of new annual revenue.&quot; European Commission&#39;s president, Ursula von der Leyen, criticized the US government&#39;s decision. &quot;As I have said before, tariffs are taxes — bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the US and the European Union,&quot; she said in a statement . In the White House&#39;s announcement, however, the administration insisted that tariffs are good for the country&#39;s economy and will not lead to inflation or an increase in prices.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-adds-new-shuttle-rides-between-jfk-airport-and-manhattan-100039821.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Uber has new shuttle routes for NYC travelers. Less than six months after launching bus rides between LaGuardia Airport and Manhattan , the company is adding four routes between John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Manhattan. Beginning on Thursday, you can book up to four seats for one of the new routes. You can reserve them as early as seven days in advance or as late as two minutes before you hop on. Each bus has a 14-passenger limit at launch. Much like your flight, you can bring one piece of luggage weighing up to 50 lbs and a personal item that fits in your lap or under your seat. When you get onboard, the driver will verify your identity with a QR code and PIN. The four new routes include stops at either Port Authority Terminal and Grand Central Terminal or Chinatown and Atlantic Terminal. Each of those two Manhattan courses is split into two additional routes — one to JFK&#39;s Terminal 4 and another to Terminal 5. They run every 30 minutes, from 5AM to 10:45PM, all week. The JFK shuttles will typically cost &quot;up to $25&quot; for one way, but Uber is launching the new rides with introductory one-way pricing of $10 through April 30. Uber says it&#39;s booked hundreds of thousands of shuttle seats since it launched its LaGuardia routes last fall. Although it can be a handy way to get around (and cheaper than hailing a cab), there&#39;s a free public transit shuttle running between the airport and the subway. As Redditor u/Kufat opined about Uber&#39;s shuttles in October, &quot;This is for tourists who think they&#39;ll get stabbed the moment they enter the subway.&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-adds-new-shuttle-rides-between-jfk-airport-and-manhattan-100039821.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best power banks and portable chargers for every device in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Few things are more panic-inducing than a phone’s battery hitting five percent when you’re nowhere near a charger. That’s what power banks are for. Keep a full one in your bag and you’ll never have to worry about a dead phone (or tablet or even laptop) again. For over two years, I’ve tested dozens of portable chargers, ranging from small MagSafe-compatible packs to massive 27,500-milliamp-hour bricks. Not every battery out there is a winner, and the tech seems to be steadily improving — what I’m testing in 2025 definitely outshines what I was trying out in 2022. So this guide is here to help you pick the best power bank for any situation, along with our advice on what to consider when picking out a portable charger. Table of contents Best power banks for 2025 How we test best power banks What to look for in a portable battery pack Other power banks we tested Best power banks for 2025 What to look for in a portable battery pack Battery type Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even increased in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t suffer from a memory effect (where a battery&#39;s lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges). One drawback you may have heard is the possibility of lithium ion batteries catching fire . To limit the danger, battery packs require internal mechanisms to limit things like voltage and pressure. While you should still make sure a battery isn’t exposed to unnecessary stress like excessive heat, damage from drops or operating in freezing weather, battery packs are considered safe enough to bring on an airplane. According to the TSA , external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) can fly with you – just make sure you stash them in your carryon as they aren’t allowed in checked baggage. Capacity Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick. You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent. Wireless More manufacturers are making power banks with wireless charging. Not hassling with cables is nice, but it’s important to note that wireless charging is less efficient than plugging in your phone. Outside of MagSafe options, wireless portable chargers historically didn’t make the cut for our top picks for this guide for that reason. The Qi2 wireless charging standard arrived last year and improves performance for wireless charging, including for portable banks. Currently, iPhones are the only handsets that support the new tech, but as it’s an open standard, expect Google, Samsung and others to adopt it for future phones. In my testing, I’ve noticed an uptick in the performance of non-Qi2-enabled batteries as well, so you&#39;ll now see wireless options on this list. Ports Since Apple ditched the Lightning cable and adopted USB-C, we’re getting closer to a standard for charging connections — and all of our picks have at least one such port. But plenty of other devices use older interfaces, like USB-A and microUSB ports, plus Lightning for older iPhones. You can find cables with just about any combination of those connections, so when you’re picking out a battery, just check that one end of your preferred cord will fit. Most battery packs have more than one port, which gives you different charging options. You’ll typically see at least one port labeled “in/out,” which means you can use it to both charge the bank and charge your device. While USB-A output ports can power up smartphones and other small devices, they can’t charge larger devices. Plus, they aren’t as fast as USB-C ports overall. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re deciding which ports and charging cables to use to connect your phone to the pack. There’s even more variation among USB-C ports themselves, with different ports on the same device supporting different power transfer rates. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank’s 18W port. But to properly charge, say, a MacBook or similar laptop, it’ll need the extra juice supplied by a 100W port (which larger power banks can offer). Power banks with more than one port can also charge multiple devices at the same time, but speeds and the overall charge delivered will be lower. You’ll also want to consider your charging cable. For anything larger than a smartphone (and to access fast-charging capabilities) you’ll want to use USB-C ports and cables. But not all cables are created equal, even when they have the same USB-C plugs on the end. If you want power delivery from a 100W USB-C power bank port, you’ll need a 100W-rated USB-C cable. Luckily, power banks capable of delivering 100W tend to include a compatible cable. For any devices that don’t, we’ve tried and liked Anker’s 100W USB-C cable . For smaller devices, we used this 60W cable from Nimble and we don’t recommend bothering with cables under 60W. For around $20, higher-capacity charging cables will make sure you’re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer. Design For the most part, these rechargeable batteries have a squared-off, brick-like design, though many nod towards aesthetics with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power stations include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage. How we test best power banks Before we even put our hands on a battery pack, we did extensive research. We considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and we checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then we get our hanHere’s the full list of power banks we&#39;ve tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries. Amy Skorheim for Engadget MagSafe-compatible Apple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh) Spigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh) Anker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh) Mophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh) Baseus Magnetic (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh) Anker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh) UGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh) EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic (5,000mAh)&nbsp; Low capacity (≤10,000mAh) Mophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh) Anker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh) Anker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Biolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh) Anker Nano (5,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Satechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh) Anker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh) Mid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh) Baseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh) Otterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh) Anker Prime (20,000mAh) Nestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh) Nimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh) High capacity (20,001mAh+) Mophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh) UGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh) Anker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh) Zendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Trek (27,000mAh) HyperJuice 245W (27,000mAh) Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh) Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable (25,000mAh) We&#39;re continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary.&nbsp; For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 15, an iPhone 14 Plus, an iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer). I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used this 60W-rated USB-C to USB-C cable . For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing: iPhone 11: 3,110 mAh iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh iPhone 15 : 3,349 mAh Galaxy S22 Ultra : 4,855mAh iPad Air : 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh I noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design. Other power banks we tested Anker Prime 20,000 mAh power bank Anker’s Prime bank was our previous pick for the best premium power bank, but I thought it worked best with the expensive (yet very convenient) base. Considering it also doesn’t have any built-in cables, we decided to bump the Prime battery from its position and replace it with the Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank . There’s still plenty to like about the Prime battery: it’s solid, attractive and tells you just how much charge it has left with its onboard display. When you add the optional base, you not only get a convenient drop-and-go way to recharge, it also acts as a charging hub with three additional USB ports. EcoFlow Rapid magnetic I was curious to try out the first power bank from EcoFlow, a company that primarily makes larger power stations and whole-home backup batteries . The first offering in the brand’s Rapid series is a Qi2-enabled magnetic charger with a 5,000mAh capacity . It looks quite nice with shiny silver accents and soft-touch grey plastic on the MagSafe-compatible front. There’s a little pull-out leg that sturdily displays your phone as it charges and the attached USB-C cable lets you refill devices directly, then tucks out of the way when it’s not in use. But it didn’t outperform our top pick in the MagSafe category, in terms of both charging speeds and the amount of charge delivered. Baseus Blade 2 The Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that’s just a little wider than an ereader — which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up. Anker MagGo (6.6K) Anker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some. Mophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini The Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini. Power bank FAQs What&#39;s the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger? A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery.&nbsp; There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability. Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes. Does fast charging actually ruin your battery? Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work. While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged. In short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do. Can you use a power bank for all your devices? That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.

    "description": "Not everyone needs to spend a fortune to get a mobile phone that does everything they want. The best budget Android phones prove you can snag a new phone with great performance, solid build quality and all the key features you actually care about — without the hefty price tag. You might not get a flagship device with every bell and whistle, but for most people, that’s probably just fine. Maybe you’re not chasing the latest camera system or trying to capture the perfect selfie, and instead, you just want a decent camera, a smooth AMOLED display and a battery that lasts all day. These budget-friendly phones are designed to deliver exactly that, focusing on practicality and value while still offering impressive camera quality and features that hit the right price point. If you’re ready to upgrade without breaking the bank, these are the best Android phones you can get on a budget. Table of contents Best budget Android phones for 2025 How cheap should you go for an Android? What to look for in a cheap phone Android phone FAQs Best budget Android phones for 2025 How cheap should you go for an Android? We tend to define a budget phone as costing between $150 and $350. Any lower and the device runs the risk of suffering from too many compromises, and above that, you cross over to pricier midrange handsets (if you&#39;re open to spending more, we shouted out a couple of our favorites at the very end of this guide). But for those with a little wiggle room, there are some things to consider. For example, a child may be better off with a cheaper device, especially if it’s intended mainly for emergencies or texting parents (and not social media). On the higher end of this price spectrum, sub-$350 phones have come a long way thanks to improved performance, better cameras with low-light capabilities, fast charging, and nicer displays like AMOLED panels. This makes them a viable alternative to, say, a flagship handset with a premium design, even if you have the flexibility to spend more. What to look for in a cheap phone When it comes to cheap phones, you get what you pay for. Most smartphones in this price range are made out of plastic, though the fit and finish of a specific model can vary a lot based on price. A bright screen is also important. Typically you’ll get LCD panels with a 60Hz or 90Hz refresh rate, but some phones may have OLED or AMOLED screens with increased color saturation. Long battery life is critical as well, so we tend to favor devices with larger power cells of around 5,000 mAh. In this price range, performance can vary a lot, so look for devices with at least 8GB of RAM and processors that can deliver stutter-free visuals. It’s also important to consider support length: as periodic security updates and lengthy software support can extend the longevity of your device, which will save you money in the long run. Android phone FAQs What&#39;s the price difference for a cheap Android vs a cheap iPhone? iPhones tend to be more expensive compared to Android phones — even the cheapest iPhone, the iPhone SE, which starts from $429, is a harder pill to swallow compared to a cheap Android phone. In contrast, you can get your hands on a cheap Android device for as low as $100.

    "description": "YouTube Shorts has introduced a change that brings analytics for its bite-sized video option into closer parity with rival services TikTok and Instagram. The video platform will remove the minimum play time requirement it previously had for a user watching a clip to count as a view. Beginning March 31, a &quot;view&quot; will be added any time a YouTube Short is played or replayed. This will likely mean that creators will see higher view counts after the change takes place. YouTube will continue to track &quot;engaged views,&quot; which measure the number of times a clip was played &quot;for a certain number of seconds.&quot; YouTube clarified that the shift would not impact Creator earnings or their eligibility for the YouTube Partner Program; both will continue to be assessed by the engaged view metric. Both Instagram and TikTok have defined a &quot;view&quot; as the number of times a video starts playing, although those platforms also offer metrics for tracking time spent watching a piece of content. Considering YouTube Shorts , Instagram and TikTok have each claimed upwards of a billion monthly users, it makes sense that they count views similarly so that creators can better assess how many of those people they are reaching across the services.

    "description": "Utah Governor Spencer Cox has signed the App Store Accountability Act into law, making it the first state to require that app store makers verify their users&#39; ages. Under this law , people in Utah will need to be over age 18 to make a new account with an app store; underage users will either need to link their account to a parent&#39;s so that the adult can give permission for the child to use certain apps. The legislation is intended to protect children and teens, according to bill sponsor Todd Weiler, a Republican state senator. However, it has also raised questions about privacy and where the burden of responsibility falls to ensure that underage users don&#39;t see inappropriate content. Meta, Snap and X have supported the measure. &quot;We applaud Governor Cox and the State of Utah for being the first in the nation to empower parents and users with greater control over teen app downloads, and urge other states to consider this groundbreaking approach,&quot; the three companies said in a joint statement Wednesday. &quot;This approach spares users from repeatedly submitting personal information to countless individual apps and online services.&quot; Google, which runs the Play Store, had opposed the bill, and called on the governor to veto the measure. We&#39;ve reached out to Apple and Google for comment now that the bill has been signed into law. As it stands, the App Store Accountability Act is slated to take effect on May 7, but it seems likely that it will face legal challenges. Digital privacy groups have opposed the law and others like it, noting security concerns about how sensitive age verification data will be used or protected. Other state laws requiring online services to confirm users&#39; ages have also prompted lawsuits.

    "description": "Amazon&#39;s Big Spring Sale is much less focused on electronics than something like Prime Day or Black Friday, but it still includes a handful of tech deals worth calling out. If you’re looking to grab a new gadget on the cheap, we’ve rounded up the best of those that are available for less than $50. Some of the discounts have technically been available for a few days, but the offers still cover several devices we recommend in our various buying guides . As a reminder, Amazon says this latest sitewide sale will run through March 31, and you don&#39;t need to be a Prime member to access most of the deals.&nbsp; Best Amazon Spring Sale deals under $50 Anker PowerConf C200 for $48 ($12 off MSRP) : The PowerConf C200 is our favorite webcam for those on a tighter budget due to its crisp video quality, easy setup, solid microphones and built-in privacy cover. Its USB cable is on the shorter side, and it can’t match the overall accuracy of our top pick, but it’s still a clear upgrade over a built-in laptop camera for a much lower price. This is another deal we’ve seen numerous times in the last year, but it’s as low as the camera usually goes. Also at Anker . Anker 525 Charging Station for $30 ($36 off) : We recommend this reliable desktop charging station in our remote worker gift guide . It can’t provide the absolute fastest charge to your smartphone or laptop (topping out at a quick enough 67W), but it packs four USB ports — two USB-C, two USB-A — and three AC outlets in a frame that’s small enough to fit on a crowded desk. This deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . The Anker 525 Charging Station. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anker Nano Charger 30W for $13 ($10 off) : It’s hard to have too many portable wall chargers on standby. This one from Anker should be particularly useful for traveling: At just over an inch thick, it’s small enough to fit in a pocket, while its 30W USB-C port is enough to top up recent iPhones at full speed. (That’s not enough for some newer Android phones , though.) This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Anker . Amazon Music Unlimited 3-month trial for free ($24 off) : Amazon is offering new subscribers three months of its Music Unlimited streaming service for free. Normally, it gives new users a one-month trial. Though Music Unlimited isn’t a top pick in our guide to the best music services , it still gets you lossless streaming quality and an extensive library of both music and podcasts. You could do worse if you just want to bum a few months of music streaming for no cost. Just note that your subscription will auto-renew once the trial period ends until you cancel. The Blink Mini 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Blink Mini 2 for $20 ($20 off) : This deal ties the lowest price to date for the Blink Mini 2, which is the budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras . This one comes with its share of trade-offs for the low price — its image quality isn’t the best, it locks certain features behind a paywall and it won’t automatically arm when you leave the house — but it still provides functional 1080p video, color night vision, motion alerts and Alexa support in a weather-resistant frame. It’s fairly simple to set up, too, though you’ll need to buy an external module if you want to store clips locally. Also at Best Buy , Lowe&#39;s and The Home Depot . Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Unlike the AirTag, it can also attach directly to a keychain. It probably isn’t the safest choice for long-distance travel, but it’s a convenient security blanket if you, say, leave your keys or wallet behind at a restaurant. This is another discount that’s been available for a few weeks, but it’s just 10 cents more the best price we’ve seen.

    "title": "Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals: Save up to $200 on AirPods, iPads and more",

    "description": "Amazon&#39;s Big Spring Sale may be aimed at things like apparel and outdoor goods more than electronics, but we’ve cut through the noise and found a few actually decent tech deals anyway. If you’re specifically looking for a new Apple device, good news: Various AirPods, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and Beats speakers are at or near their lowest prices to date. Many of these discounts aren’t explicitly tied to the sale, but if you’re just trying to save a few bucks, that shouldn’t matter much. We’ve rounded up the best Spring Sale Apple deals we could find below. As a reminder: Amazon says the event will run through March 31, and you don&#39;t need to be a Prime member to access any of the offers below.&nbsp; Best Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $149 ($30 off MSRP) : This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple’s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn’t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a score of 86 in our review. This discount is $11 higher than the best price we’ve seen, but it’s about as low as the earbuds have fallen outside of that. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. Also at Best Buy . The Apple Watch Series 10. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off) : The top pick in our guide to the best smartwatches , the Series 10 is a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer profile and a marginally larger display compared to the previous Series 9. That said, it remains a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. It should be a welcome upgrade if you’re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch (think pre-Series 7) — just keep in mind a patent dispute has locked it out the blood oxygen detection features found on those older models. This $100 discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the non-cellular model with a 42mm case. Also at Best Buy and Walmart . Apple Mac mini (M4 Pro) for $1,199 ($200 off) : It&#39;s still not cheap, but here&#39;s the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for this higher-spec configuration of the latest Mac mini, which includes an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. This specific model is overkill for casual users, but it should be a decent buy for those with more professional needs who want a compact Mac but can’t spring for the top-end Mac Studio . We gave the Mac mini a score of 90 in our review last November, praising its performance, pint-sized design and port selection, though it can get noisy under load and it still lacks an SD card reader. Also at B&amp;H . The M4 Pro Mac mini. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget Apple iPad (A16) for $329 ($20 off) : The newest entry-level iPad only arrived three weeks ago, but Amazon is currently selling it for $20 less than Apple direct, which is a decent little savings if you planned on grabbing the tablet early anyway. This one is another small update, but it now comes with a faster A16 chip, more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for media consumption and lighter work, it&#39;s still a fine value. Also at B&amp;H and Best Buy . Apple iPad Air 11-inch (M3) for $549 ($50 off) : Much like the deal on the base iPad above, this isn’t a huge discount, but it’s a nice chance to save a few bucks compared to buying from Apple directly. The new iPad Air was released on the same day as the iPad (A16) and is a similarly minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still prefer the Air over the base model if you can swing it: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. The older M2-powered model is an even better value if you can find it on sale, but either way the Air is the iPad we recommend to most people. Also at B&amp;H , Best Buy and Walmart . The 13-inch iPad Air M3. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $738 ($61 off) : We gave the 13-inch iPad Air a review score of 89 earlier this month. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 128GB model. Also at Walmart . Apple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off) : The iPad Pro is more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being how expensive it all is. This deal on doesn’t truly lessen that — and it’s another deal we’ve seen multiple times in recent months — but it still ties the 13-inch model’s all-time low.

    "description": "The Amazon Big Spring Sale isn’t as huge as, say, the company’s (two) Prime Day sales, but there are still plenty of deals to be found — particularly on goods for your home. While Engadget doesn’t test sheets and pillows, we do put our review skills to work on kitchen tech . We’ve combed through Amazon&#39;s long lists of what&#39;s on sale and found a good number of deals on the cooking gear we recommend. So if you’re in the market for a discount on a sous vide machine , coffee kettle or an air fryer , this is a good list to check out. The best Amazon Spring Sale deals on air fryers, Instant Pots and more Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $140 ($40 off) : The powerful Juice Fountain impressed us with its extraction abilities. Plus it’s relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This price isn’t as low as the $110 Amazon sold it for back in January, but this is the lowest price we’ve tracked since then. Anova Culinary Sous Vide Precision Cooker Nano for $100 ($50 off) : This is the machine that led our editor to dub these machines the “Millennial crockpot.” She uses this one a few times a week to make unfussy meals that keep her alive. The Nano model is a slightly smaller and less expensive version of the top pick in our buyer’s guide. This is about $10 more than the all-time low, but is the cheapest we’ve seen Amazon sell it for over the past couple of months. Cosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off) : Cosori’s fryer earned a spot as the runner up for best overall air fryer in our guide. It has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity. We like that it doesn’t take up too much space, but can still cook up a decent amount of food Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off) : If you want a more traditional toaster oven design with a huge capacity, go for our premium air fryer pick. The fryer-and-oven combo can accommodate a five-quart dutch oven, so it’s almost an auxiliary oven, which could come in handy when you’re cooking for a crowd. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it went for $300 at the end of last year. Breville the Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off) : This is the non-Pro version of the Breville air fryer we recommend . It has a slightly smaller capacity (0.8 cubic feet instead of one cubic foot) and is missing two cooking functions (dehydrate and proof). But if you’re not making your own jerky or baking a ton of bread, this one can toast, broil, air fry and slow cook. You can even get it in cool colors like Red Velvet Cake for the same price. Ninja DZ401 Foodi 10-quart air fryer for $190 ($40 off) : If you need to air fry two different foods at once, go for our recommendation for a dual-zone air fryer. It’s a beast, so we think it’s best for larger kitchens and people who make big meals. It went as low as $130 for Black Friday last year, but this is the cheapest price we’ve seen since then. Instant Vortex 2QT Mini Air Fryer for $50 ($10 off) : The budget pick in our guide doesn’t go on sale often — it’s already pretty cheap at its $60 list price. It’s sold for as little as $48 for Prime Day in July, but this is the cheapest we’ve seen since then. Its two-quart capacity is probably best for small kitchens and can crisp up food for one or two people. Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $90 $40 off) : We like this Instant Pot model because it&#39;s simple to use and has several quick-cooking modes including beans, cake, sous vide and more. It went as low as $70 earlier this year, but this is still a 30 percent discount off the list price. Instant Pot Pro Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $138 ($61 off) : We also suggest this fancier Pro Plus model in our guide to kitchen tech . It’s a Wi-Fi connected unit with a canning function and you can even release the steam remotely using the companion app — which has over 800 recipes. This isn&#39;t an all-time low — it was $125 earlier this week and dipped as low as $99 for Black Friday last year.&nbsp; Ninja AF150AMZ Air Fryer for $120 (25 percent off) : This went as low as $100 for the holidays last year, but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen since then. The fryer gets an honorable mention in our air fryer guide because it makes good use of limited counter space with its taller design. The round cooking basket doesn’t feel as roomy as square ones but it does have a dehydrate option that other cookers don’t come with. Anova Culinary Sous Vide 3.0 for $129 ($70 off) : We named this the best overall sous vide machine after testing a number of models for our buyer’s guide. This is about $30 more than the low it hit for the holidays last year, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. We appreciate the easy digital controls and found that the high flow rate maintains water temperature better than other machines. Plus, if you’re at a loss for what to cook, you can check out the companion app which is replete with recipes. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $165 ($30 off) : This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. This is the pro model of the version we recommend in our tea guide . KitchenAid Artisan 5-quart stand mixer for $380 ($80 off) : Small wonder that the home cook’s gold standard of mixers made its way onto our kitchen tech guide . Its ton of available attachments can be used to make pasta, grind food, strain or spiralize fruits and veggies and more. This is no unitasker. This is a solid $80 discount off of the MSRP, but we’ll note that Amazon sold it for as low as $330 at the end of last year and for $350 last month. KitchenAid Go Cordless Hand Blender for $100 ($30 off) : The big selling point here is the removable battery that you can use for other KitchenAid Go appliances. In our testing, it had enough power to turn a roasted butternut squash into a smooth, creamy soup. The blender has hit this price a few times over the past few months and the deal isn’t as good as the $77 it sold for at the end of last year.

    "description": "This year’s Amazon Spring Sale is in full swing, and as promised, a ton of household, fashion and outdoor gear has dropped to record-low prices. Tech isn’t a huge focus for this sale, but there are a decent number of devices on sale right now for some of the best prices we’ve seen all year. The selection may not be as good as that of Amazon Prime Day in July, but it still provides a good opportunity to save on things like headphones, robot vacuums, air purifiers and more. We’ve collected the best Amazon Spring Sale deals on tech gear here so you don’t have to go searching for them. The Spring Sale runs through March 31, so check back here for all of the latest deals as they drop. Best Amazon Spring Sale deals 10th-gen iPad for $269 (23 percent off): The previous version of most affordable iPad gives you an A14 Bionic chip, a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, TouchID built into the lock button and more. It’s compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the keyboard folio, plus we found it to have solid performance and a matching battery life. Dyson AM09 heater and fan for $300 (36 percent off): The AM09 has been around for ages, and for good reason. It&#39;s an excellent heater during cold months and fan during warm months, so you can use it all year round. Jet Focus control lets you choose from Focused or Diffused for personal or whole-room heating or cooling, and the handy sleep timer lets you set when the device turns off in intervals from 15 minutes up to nine hours. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off): This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off): A version of one of our favorite air fryers , this air fryer toaster oven has 11 cooking modes including air fry, broil, bake, roast and more, and it has a large capacity that can fit up to six slices of bread at once or a 13-inch pizza. The Pro model is also on sale, down to $320 from $400. Sonos Ray for $179 ($100 off): This is our favorite midrange soundbar thanks to its compact, attractive design and easy setup. It&#39;s best for those who have a smaller living room or den they want to outfit with better TV sound. Also available at Sonos in their March Madness sale . Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $318 (20 percent off): These top our list of the best wireless headphones you can get right now thanks to their supreme comfort, excellent sound quality and ANC, multipoint connectivity and 30-hour battery life. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $249 ($100 off): These Bose over-ear headphones provide excellent noise cancellation, a comfortable fit and up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. A quick-charge feature will net you 2.5 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging, so you&#39;ll rarely have to go without them, too. Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones for $349 ($80 off): These hold the top spot in our best wireless headphones guide for excellent noise cancellation. These cans will give you a step up in ANC, blocking out most noise and chatter of those around you. General audio quality has been improved as well, and they have a comfy fit. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $20 (43 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget streaming device can play content at 1080p/60fps and now its remote can also control your TV&#39;s power and volume. There&#39;s also Alexa support built into the remote, so you can use voice commands to search for content. Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off): Apple’s flagship wearable is the best smartwatch you can buy, period. While the Series 10 was an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently. Apple Watch SE for $169 ($80 off): Those on tighter budgets can opt for the Apple Watch SE and know they’re getting the core Apple wearable experience with few compromises. We consider it to be the best smartwatch for newbies. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. If that’s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide . We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then. AirPods Max (USB-C) for $480 ($70 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. Mac mini M4 for $529 ($70 off): If you&#39;re on the market for a new desktop, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Beats Studio Pro for $180 (49 percent off): These Beats headphones have improved sound quality, good Transparency mode and USB-C charging, plus decent mic quality for phone calls. They support wired USB-C audio, plus they have solid ANC as well. Beats Fit Pro for $169 (15 percent off): These are the best wireless earbuds for working out thanks to their comfortable, secure fit, good sound quality with thumping bass and handful of convenient features provided by Apple&#39;s H1 chipset. It provides quick-pairing and switching between Apple devices (and quick pairing with Android phones), Find My compatibility and hands-free Siri. Chipolo One for $20 ($5 off) : The Chipolo One is the top overall pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . While Apple’s AirTag can tap into a substantially larger crowd-sourcing network, we’ve found the One to send separation alerts faster when you’ve left an item behind and ring louder when you’re back in its vicinity. Blink Mini 2 for $20 (50 percent off): Blink&#39;s latest wired, indoor security camera is one of our favorites , particularly if you&#39;re just starting out building a security camera system. It&#39;s easy to set up and use, and it works seamlessly with Amazon&#39;s Alexa. Plus, if you want a local storage option, you can buy the Blink Sync Module 2 and a thumb drive to store video clips locally. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $300 ($138 off): This is a version of one of our top picks in our best robot vacuums guide. Shark makes excellent robovacs with strong suction power and convenient bagless, self-emptying bases. This model in particular can hold up to 60 days worth of debris before its base needs to be emptied. If you want a machine that can mop in addition to vacuum, consider Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac , which is 47 percent off and down to $400. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $149 (45 percent off): This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 ($30 off): One of our favorites in our best air fryers guide, this Cosori model has nine preset cooking modes and a spacious cooking basket that can handle more food at once than you might expect. It&#39;s not too large, so it can sit on your countertop all the time, and the basket has a safety release button that prevents accidental pulls. Levoit Core 400S air purifier for $190 ($30 off with coupon): Our top pick for the best air purifier for most people, the Core 400S has easy-to-use onboard controls, powerful filtering technology that isn&#39;t too loud and relatively affordable replacement filters. It reliably improved air quality in our testing, and even though its mobile app is a little overstuffed, it gives you another way to control and monitor the device. TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro mesh Wi-Fi system for $280 (30 percent off): Our current pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system you can get, this TP-Link bundle may be no-frills, but it gets the job done nicely. It&#39;s easy to set up and provides excellent Wi-Fi 6E performance, plus the three included nodes can cover up to 7,200 square feet. Samsung Evo Select microSD card (512GB) for $35 ($5 off): A value pick in our best microSD cards guide, this Evo Select card provides respectable read and write speeds, and it comes with a full-sized adapter. Samsung T7 portable SSD (2TB) for $140 (48 percent off): We&#39;re on the T9 series now, but if you&#39;re looking to save a bit of cash, the T7 remains a great option for on-the-go storage. It supports read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and sports a pocket-friendly design. Amazon Spring Sale FAQs When is the Amazon Spring Sale?

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-robot-vacuum-deals-the-best-sales-from-shark-irobot-dyson-and-others-092652375.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The big news in robot vacuums right now is iRobot’s announcement that it’s not confident in its ability to continue operating. That’s surprising considering the Roomba’s dominance in the automated floor-bot market. The company also makes up more than a few top picks in our budget and standard robo vac buying guides . Fortunately, a number of other brands make great vacs, too — and Roombas are still available. Thanks to Amazon’s Big Spring Sale this week, a number of robot vacuums are seeing decent discounts right now. We also found deals on a few of our recommended cordless stick vacs, for those who prefer to tackle their floors manually. The best Amazon Spring Sale robot vacuum deals Shark&#39;s Matrix Plus robovac for $400 ($350 off) : In our testing, we’ve been consistently impressed with Shark vacuums — but they’re not cheap. This machine can mop in addition to vacuum and is nearly half price at 47 percent off. Shark Robot PowerDetect NeverTouch vac and mop combo for $500 ($400 off) : This is the non-pro model of our runner up pick for the best combo bot. It mops and vacuums, quickly making a map of your home on its first run. The app easily lets you program where your hard and carpeted surfaces are, as well as set schedules. The base empties the dry debris and dirty water, then refills it with new water. The difference between this model and the Pro version is that this one doesn’t clean the mop with each use, so you may need to manually perform that task more often — but the price difference may make up for that lack. iRobot Roomba Combo Vac and Mop for $150 (45 percent off) : This &quot;essential&quot; Roomba is relatively no-frills, but it has the added benefit of being a mopping robot in addition to a vacuum. It includes a washable mopping pad and a water reservoir so you can clean hard floors, and it will autonomously vacuum just like all of iRobot&#39;s other basic robovacs. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $400 ($200 off) : If you can’t decide between a robot vacuum or a lightweight stick vac, you don’t have to. The new Eufy E20 combines a robo vac, cordless upright and handheld vacuum in one machine. Plus the automatically emptying base holds a lot of debris for its size. While we found the robot performance to be better than the stick vac suction, it’s still impressive and convenient for an all-in-one model. Anker Eufy Robot Vacuum 11S MAX for $140 (44 percent off) : The “S” in the model name stands for “slim” and it was one of the more low-profile machines we tried. It’s a pick in our guide to budget robot vacuums and has a long battery life and good suction power for its price. The main drawback is the lack of Wi-Fi, so instead of programming it with your phone, you’ll use the included remote. The best cordless vacuum deals Tineco Pure ONE Station 5 for $349 ($110 off) : This vac earned an honorable mention in our tests. The self-emptying base is a big selling point. We also liked the auto-adjusting suction and single-button start feature. The fact that it doesn’t require proprietary bags helps keep down the long-term cost, too. &nbsp; Tineco Pure ONE S11 cordless vacuum for $200 ($100 off with coupon) : Click the coupon to get $95 off our top pick for a budget stick vac. We like that it automatically adjusts suction depending on what it&#39;s picking up and is relatively lightweight when you’re pushing it around your floors. The bin is on the small side and the battery life isn’t as good as on other models, but it’s an easy-to-use, no-frills way to clean floors. Dyson V15s Detect Submarine for $800 ($150 off) : This Dyson cordless stick vacuum and mop is a top pick in our best cordless vacuums guide thanks to its sleek design and included mop attachment that easily swap in so you can clean tile, hardwood and other flooring with liquid solution. Yes, it&#39;s expensive, but you&#39;re essentially getting two cleaning machines in one — plus, when used as a vacuum, it has excellent suction power and great battery life. Levoit Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (LVAC-200) for $150 ($50 off) : The lowest price we’ve tracked on this stick vac is $130 but this matches the lowest price we’ve seen this year. It’s our runner up budget pick for a stick vac in our guide. It doesn’t have a storage base and the bin is smallish, but it’s lightweight and super affordable. It also disassembles easily for storage making its lack of base less of a deal breaker. Tineco Pure ONE Station FurFree for $400 ($300 off) : Of all the stick vacs our reviewer tried for our guide , this is the one she wanted to use the most. It’s super convenient with a dock that charges and empties and cleans all parts of the machine — brush, tube and dustbin — after each use. Plus the suction power is great and the iLoop smart sensor kicks up the suction when needed.

    "description": "Codemasters&#39; Formula 1 franchise is back for another lap. Publisher EA says the tracks in F1 2025 have a more realistic look and feel, thanks to LiDAR scanning. The new installment arrives on May 30. Although EA didn&#39;t offer much detail about LiDAR&#39;s use, we can safely assume it involved high-resolution 3D scans of real-world tracks to make them as close to a 1:1 representation as possible. (After all, it&#39;s the same tech autonomous vehicles use for real-time 3D mapping and object detection.) Regardless, we reached out to EA to try to get more info. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back. EA / Codemasters In other areas, F1 25 overhauls My Team, with players now able to serve as the squad&#39;s owner and driver. And in the Braking Point story mode, Konnersport has moved up in the world and is now a highly competitive team battling for championships. But wait, &quot;a dramatic event throws the team into chaos,&quot; so rest assured the writing team still understands the importance of using obstacles in storytelling. F1 25 launches on PS5 , Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 30. If you own F1 23 or F1 24 , you can save 15 percent off your pre-order of the game&#39;s Iconic Edition, which typically costs $80 on PC and $90 on consoles. That variant will add post-launch Braking Point chapters that tie into Apple&#39;s upcoming film F1 , starring Brad Pitt. Meanwhile, the base game costs $60 on PC and $70 on PlayStation and Xbox. You can check out the trailer below, featuring cover star Lewis Hamilton.

    "description": "Samsung just released a spate of new QLED TVs, after teasing the lineup at CES . The Neo QLED line is the first to feature the company’s Vision AI platform. This allows for new personalization and optimization features. You can pick one up right now, but you might want to open up a line of credit first. The most budget-friendly model is the 55-inch Class Neo QLED 4K QN80F, which comes in at $1,300. As for 4K models, prices balloon all the way up to $15,000 for the top-of-the-line 98-inch Class Neo QLED 4K QN90F. Samsung also just released some 8K smart TVs with Vision AI. The pricing here starts at $3,300 for a 65-inch model and goes up to $5,300 for the 85-inch version.&nbsp; If you need a high-end soundbar to go with that brand new TV, Samsung has got you covered. The company just announced availability for two new soundbar systems. The flagship HW-Q990F costs $1,800 and the HW-Q800F clocks in at $1,000. Both come with the company’s redesigned subwoofer, but the Q990F also includes a pair of rear speakers. Samsung They support wireless Dolby Atmos technology, so the cable clutter can go the way of the dodo. All of these products are available right now from Samsung or via third-party retailers.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/the-latest-kindle-update-lets-you-turn-pages-by-double-tapping-175452454.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon has updated Kindles with a new way to navigate books. While nothing will recapture the tactile pleasure of physical page turn buttons, anyone with a Kindle running Version 5.18.1 of Amazon&#39;s software will now be able to double-tap the side or back of their e-reader to turn pages. &quot;Double Tap to Page Turn&quot; can be turned on in the Settings menu under Device Options. Amazon says it works for more than just turning pages. You can also use double taps to scroll through your Home and Library pages, too. Interestingly, the option doesn&#39;t use the touchscreen at all. Good E-Reader speculates Amazon is relying on the accelerometer inside Kindles to detect taps. Along with the update, Amazon is also adding a feature it calls &quot;Recaps for Books in Series.&quot; These are short summaries &quot;for thousands of bestselling English language Kindle books in series you have purchased or borrowed.&quot; The company already does things like automatically group books from the same series to make them easier to find, but this should save you the trouble of looking up a summary of A Dance with Dragons before diving into The Winds of Winter — assuming it&#39;s ever released. The 5.18.1 update is rolling out now newer Kindles, like the Kindle Colorsoft , and devices as old as the 10th generation Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite. It will also be available on the last of Amazon&#39;s e-readers to have physical buttons, the Kindle Oasis . If you don&#39;t see it on your device now, you can manually download the update from Amazon&#39;s website and install it yourself.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apps/waze-is-officially-stopping-support-for-google-assistant-on-iphones-173545610.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The navigation app Waze is dropping Google Assistant support for iPhones , citing &quot;ongoing difficulties&quot; with integrating the service. The company says it plans on replacing it with an &quot;enhanced voice integration solution&quot; at some point in the future. Google Assistant will still work for Android users. This is happening a full year after iPhone users began reporting issues related to Google Assistant, with many people noting that voice commands were totally broken. Waze says that it has &quot;not been working as intended for over a year&quot; and that it would rather &quot;phase out Google Assistant on iOS&quot; instead of &quot;patching a feature that has faced ongoing difficulties.&quot; As previously stated, Google Assistant for Waze will continue to work on Android phones. However, there’s a valid question to be asked about how long Android users will continue to be able to issue voice commands in the app via the digital assistant. Google has pledged to transition users away from Google Assistant to Gemini. As a matter of fact, the company said that &quot;the classic Google Assistant will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices&quot; as the year winds on. It’ll also no longer be available for downloads on app stores starting later this year. Waze has already begun testing Gemini within the platform , which allows users to use natural language to report traffic incidents.

    "description": "Canon is expanding its vlogging lineup in a big way with two new models, the R50 V mirrorless and PowerShot V1 compact, both designed to take on cameras in Sony&#39;s vlogging lineup. The PowerShot V1 has an interesting new 1.4-inch sensor that&#39;s considerably larger than the ones on most compact cameras. The R50 V, meanwhile, matches features from Sony&#39;s ZV-E10 II but at a considerably lower price.&nbsp; PowerShot V1 compact camera The PowerShot V1 was already announced and released in Japan, but it&#39;s now set to come to North America. It effectively competes with Sony&#39;s ZV-1 II 1-inch sensor compact but has a much larger 1.4-inch 22.3MP sensor that&#39;s roughly the same size as Micro Four Thirds, but with a horizontal aspect ratio better suited for video. That larger size, along with the 17-52mm (3.1x zoom) f/2.8-4.5 lens, should make it superior to its rival in low light while also offering shallower depth of field. I&#39;ve only had the PowerShot V1 for a day, but it&#39;s heavy for a compact camera at 426 grams (15 ounces) and fairly thick. There aren&#39;t many manual controls other than the top mode dial, a rear setting dial for burst, exposure compensation and other functions, a lens dial for aperture, a camera/video switch and a zoom dial, along with several buttons. It has a 3-inch, one-million-dot fully articulating rear display but no electronic viewfinder, just like the ZV-1 II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Dent for Engadget It can shoot 4K 30 fps supersampled video using the full sensor width, 4K 60p video with a 1.4 times crop or 1080p at 240 fps. Also supported is Canon C-Log3 with 10-bit 4:2:2 capture to improve dynamic range and allow for easier grading. Optical along with digital enhanced stabilization are available and to allay overheating it comes with a built-in cooling fan that allows unlimited shooting times at all resolutions. Like the ZV-1 II, the PowerShot V1 supports several shooting modes aimed at creators. Those include a &quot;close-up demo mode&quot; that&#39;s equivalent to Sony&#39;s &quot;product showcase,&quot; allowing the camera to quickly focus on an object you hold in front of the camera. Another is &quot;smooth skin mode&quot; for beauty-style shooting, plus &quot;movie IS mode&quot; for vloggers that stabilizes any jolting movements like walking.&nbsp; Steve Dent for Engadget The PowerShot V1 uses Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel II autofocus system with subject detection and face/eye tracking and includes a &quot;subject tracking IS&quot; mode that automatically adjusts cropping to center the subject in the frame. You can use it as a 1080p webcam via the USB-C port, while connecting to your smartphone for live streaming. For photography, it sports a physical mechanical shutter and can shoot bursts at up to 30 fps with autofocus in electronic shutter mode. A welcome feature is a built-in ND filter (equivalent to three stops of light reduction) that will allow creators to add more bokeh on sunny days.&nbsp; Other features include support for a smallish LP-E17 battery and a single UHS-II card slot along with microphone, headphone and microHDMI connectors. However, the PowerShot V1 isn&#39;t cheap at $900. It&#39;s set to arrive in April 2025.&nbsp; EOS R50 V Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V is Canon&#39;s first true mirrorless vlogging-specific camera and is clearly designed to go up against Sony&#39;s ZV-E10 II. It&#39;s slightly taller than the PowerShot V1 but has largely the same dimensions otherwise, and weighs just a bit more if you include the new 14-30mm (21-45mm full-frame equivalent) f/4-6.3 power zoom lens.&nbsp; It has a nice array of manual controls including a primary control dial on top, a zoom rocker for supported lenses and an unusual mode dial that lets you select multiple custom video and vlogging modes including Movie Auto Slow Shutter, Slow/Fast Motion Recording and Movie IS Mode. For vloggers it has a fully-articulating 3-inch display but again, no electronic viewfinder. Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V comes with a 24MP APS-C sensor like the EOS R50 , while also including features from Canon&#39;s Cinema EOS system like C-Log3 capture and 10-bit 4:2:2 video. It can capture supersampled 4K 30 fps video using the full sensor width, 4K 60p video with a crop or 120 fps 1080p video. It&#39;s not a bad camera for photographers either, letting them shoot 12 fps bursts using the first-curtain shutter or 15 fps with the electronic shutter, all with continuous autofocus enabled.&nbsp; Like the ZV-E10 II it lacks in-body stabilization but does offer optical stabilization with supported lenses, along with electronic stabilization. For situations that require extra shake reduction, the optical and electronic stabilization modes can be combined and there&#39;s an enhanced IS mode for abrupt movements like walking. Steve Dent for Engadget The R50 V has vlogging-friendly modes like a product showcase-type function along with focus breathing correction. You get Canon&#39;s latest Dual Pixel II autofocus system that includes face and eye detection as well as subject tracking for people, animals and vehicles (along with an auto mode). A dedicated button allows you to livestream instantly with four modes supported: UVC/UAC, HDMI, Camera Connect, and Live Switcher Mobile multi-camera. It comes with a single UHS-II card slot and an LP-E17 battery, along with microphone, headphone, microHDMI and USB-C ports. The R50 V will cost $650 for the body only or $850 with the new RF-S14-30mm F4-6.3 IS STM PZ lens (sold separately for $330). Canon also announced the $1,700 RF 20mm f/1.4L VCM full-frame lens, the latest in its fast hybrid cinema-friendly series that includes the RF24mm f/1.4, RF 35mm f/1.4 and RF 50mm f/1.4 models. As mentioned, I&#39;ve only had the R50 V and PowerShot V1 cameras for a short time but you can expect a full review of both models shortly.

    "description": "The Kindle Colorsoft e-reader is on sale for $225 as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . That’s a discount of 20 percent, as the typical price hovers at $280. This deal also comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited, which is a good way to rack up some quick reads. We loved the Colorsoft in our official review , calling it the &quot;missing link in Amazon’s e-reader lineup.&quot; The reason is right in the name. This is the only Kindle with a color screen. The company led the e-reader space for 17 years before releasing a model that could display color. Amazon says it took so long because the technology just wasn’t good enough to implement until recently. The end result? The colors do really pop. This is a great choice for those who primarily read full-color materials like comics and graphic novels. There’s a pinch-to-zoom feature to get closer to details and an auto-adjusting front light. Just like most modern Kindles, the pages turn fast and the lag is minimal. It’s also waterproof, for reading poolside or in the bathtub. This model doesn’t include lock screen ads by default, which is nice. The primary downside here is the cost. It’s hard to recommend any e-reader for $280, even if it displays color. This is a premium product, however, so it’s easy to recommend it at $225.

    "description": "Indie publishers and developers are once again teaming up to show off the fruits of their labor in a gaming showcase from The Triple-i Initiative. The second edition will take place on April 10 (the same date as last year&#39;s show) at noon ET. The first showcase included the announcements of The Rogue Prince of Persia and Slay the Spire 2 , along with expansion reveals for Brotato and Vampire Survivors . Major updates for Palworld , Risk of Rain 2 and V Rising were unveiled as well. This time around, you can expect 45 minutes of world premieres, gameplay reveals, release dates, demo drops and more from 30-plus games. V Rising will be on show again this year, alongside the likes of Enshrouded and Deep Rock Galactic . The showcase trailer includes a peek at Sifu developer Sloclap &#39;s intriguing 5v5 arcade soccer game, Rematch , so it looks like we&#39;ll get an update on that one. Vampire Survivors studio Poncle is also among the list of developers with something to reveal. Not only that, Playstack, the publisher of a little game called Balatro , has something up its sleeve. &quot;We had been saving our big announcement for a special showcase,&quot; Marta Matyjewicz, marketing manager at Playstack, said in a statement. &quot;We were amazed by the quality of last year’s Triple-i, so when the opportunity came to be a part of it, we knew we had to take it. It’s truly an honor to showcase our game alongside so many awesome titles.&quot; Insert three side eyes emoji here. You&#39;ll be able to watch the showcase on several platforms, including YouTube, Twitch, Bilibili and Steam. After the main event, there will be a post-show including deep dives on some of the games. A week-long sale featuring games from both editions of Triple-i Initiative will go live on Steam, Epic Games Store, Humble and elsewhere on the same day as the showcase.

    "description": "Anker devices make up some of our top picks for the best power banks on the market , and the company debuted a few new ones at CES this year. Those included Anker&#39;s Laptop Power Bank , a 25,000mAh portable charger with three 100W USB-C ports and a single USB connector. That new device is down to the best price we&#39;ve seen since launch as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale — just $88, which represents a 20-percent discount from its original price. The new power bank , available in Black and Silver, comes with two USB-C cables and can charge four devices simultaneously. It works with laptops, smartphones, cameras, gaming consoles and more. For example, it can charge an MacBook Air with an M3 chip to 50 percent in 33 minutes. It can also get an iPhone 16 to the same level in just 25 minutes. Plus, its display shows the battery&#39;s health and temperature, along with output and input wattage.&nbsp; Anker&#39;s 140W four-port wall charger is also discounted for Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale. You can pick it up right now for $77, down from $90. It offers a display that tracks power usage for each port, fast-charge status and temperature. Plus, it has something Anker refers to as an &quot; odometer ,&quot; tracking lifetime usage hour by hour.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ankers-latest-chargers-and-power-banks-are-up-to-20-percent-off-in-the-amazon-spring-sale-130131799.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Levoit LVAC-200 cordless vacuum has been discounted to $150 as part of the Amazon Spring Sale . That’s 25 percent off and close to a record-low price. The sale only applies to the standard white model and not the blue one. The LVAC-200 made our list of the best cordless vacuums . We loved the lightweight design. It only weighs three pounds and it can easily be disassembled for storage. Just pop the cleaning head from the extension arm and the arm from the motor base. It also features a locking mechanism, so it can stand upright between cleaning sessions. The cleaning power here is more than sufficient. We found that it did a good job with &quot;all kinds of dry messes.&quot; It has three suction modes, so it can handle both hard and carpeted floors. It can even suck up pet hair, which is the true test of any vacuum. The design allows for the vacuum to easily reach underneath couches and beds, which is a fantastic bonus. On the downside, the dustbin is pretty small, at just 0.75 liters. We found during our testing that the bin could fill up with just one full cleaning session. The vacuum also includes a five-stage filtration system, but it doesn’t include a true HEPA filter.

    "description": "GeoGuessr, the geography game that tasks players with guessing a location in the world based on a random Google Street View image, is coming to Steam . It’s slated to hit early access on the platform sometime in April. That should hopefully make the game much easier to access on Steam Deck without having to fiddle with browser settings on desktop mode. The developers are taking the early access approach on Steam so they can &quot;refine the gameplay, introduce new features and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players&quot; with the aim of making &quot;the ultimate competitive and casual geography game.&quot; The early access version on Steam will at the very least have a competitive solo mode and casual Team Duels, though there are plans to add more modes and competitive features in the coming months. GeoGuessr has a fairly thriving competitive scene — this year&#39;s world championship has a $100,000 prize pool — so you could stand to cash in if you become great at the game. But be warned: if you think pro GeoGuessr might be your calling, you&#39;ll be up against some incredibly skilled players. They can pinpoint parts of the world based on corn growing at the side of a road , clouds in the sky and room decor . GeoGuessr pros are absolutely absurd. It&#39;s not clear how much the full Steam version will cost. A free version will include unlimited access to the amateur division, which is GeoGuessr&#39;s lowest rank, as well as unranked Team Duels. A Steam Pass that&#39;s available to purchase inside the game will be required to access the full Solo Duels mode. The store page notes that the price won&#39;t change during the time the game is in early access (a period that&#39;s expected to be at least six months). Nor do the developers expect to increase the price when the game exits early access. The original, 12-year-old web version allows players to make three free daily guesses, but to play more you have to pay for a subscription, which starts at $2.50 per month. Unlimited access on the mobile apps is available on the $3 per month Pro Unlimited plan. While there will be cross-play between Steam and the browser/mobile versions, the current GeoGuessr plans don&#39;t include full access to the Steam edition.

Not only is that a $15 discount, but its only a couple of dollars more than the record-low price we&#39;ve tracked. Amazon released the Fire TV Stick HD last October and, soon after, it became the top budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices . It&#39;s a basic stre2amer that received a couple of much-needed updates when Amazon revamped its Fire TV devices last year. The Fire TV Stick HD has HDR support and streams with full HD resolution. It also comes with an Alexa-powered remote control, which lets you search for titles with just a click of the Alexa button. That remote also has Netflix and Prime Video buttons, but the device can run most streaming apps, like Disney+ and Peacock.&nbsp; Elsewhere in the Fire TV lineup, you can grab the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for only $40 thanks to Amazon Spring Sale deals. This is the most powerful streaming dongle Amazon makes, with support for 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos, Wi-Fi 6E and Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass gaming.

Right now, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 earbuds are down to $45 from $80 — a 44 percent discount. That&#39;s an incredible price for earbuds with active noise cancellation.&nbsp; The $45 deal on our favorite budget wireless earbuds is available for the Black and Blue models, while the White, Green and Purple options are slightly more expensive at $50. However, the latter two typically retail for $100 , so they&#39;re actually half off with the current sale.&nbsp; As mentioned above, one of the great things about Anker&#39;s Soundcore Space A40 earbuds is that they offer ANC. Anker claims that using it can reduce potential noise by 98 percent. The earbuds also hold up to 10 hours of battery and up to 50 hours with the charging case. Plus, you can get up to four hours of extra juice with just 10 minutes in the case.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/napster-just-sold-for-207-million-154432315.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The once-iconic music-sharing platform Napster was just purchased for $207 million, with a company called Infinite Reality picking up the tab. What could Napster offer in 2025 to warrant such a price tag? Infinite Reality says it&#39;ll be used as a &quot;social music platform that prioritizes active fan engagement&quot; with a focus on giving artists a platform they can use to connect with listeners and, of course, make more money from them. More specifically, the company plans on creating virtual 3D spaces for music fans to attend concerts and listening parties, in addition to creating a sales platform for musicians and labels to sell merch. This isn’t the worst idea in the world, as attending these kinds of shared events is probably my favorite aspect of VR. It&#39;s not clear what will happen with the existing Napster service; for now, it doesn&#39;t appear it&#39;ll go away immediately. While it offers a similarly massive catalog to what you&#39;ll find on industry leaders Spotify and Apple Music as well as others, the service isn&#39;t really top-of-mind anymore.&nbsp; &quot;The most legendary collab?! Infinite Reality has acquired iconic online music brand @Napster . With this acquisition, we&#39;re expanding and reimagining Napster, empowering artists with new audience monetization and engagement capabilities, underpinned by iR’s #immersive … pic.twitter.com/L4Fig7QFct — Infinite Reality (@Infinite_iR) March 25, 2025 “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” Acunto said. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.” Napster holds numerous licenses to stream millions of songs, which is what made it an attractive prospect to Infinite Reality. The company says its version of Napster will “disrupt legally.” Current Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos says that the purchase will allow artists to create “crazy environments that are really only limited by their imaginations.” As an example, he described a reggae artist who might enjoy a virtual beach environment. Acunto adds that it’ll be like “Clubhouse times a trillion.” He’s referring to the virtual events app that became popular during COVID , but eventually petered out. Infinite Reality has been on a buying spree the last couple of years. In addition to Napster, it purchased the Drone Racing League , the metaverse marketing platform Landvault and the VR shopping platform Obsess . As for Napster, it started in 1999 and took the world by storm, creating an easy-peasy way to steal music. It only took a couple of years for mounting legal battles to catch up to the platform and it declared bankruptcy in 2001. However, that was just the beginning . The software company Roxio purchased the platform in 2002 and relaunched it as a legitimate e-commerce venture that sold digital music files. In 2008, Best Buy came calling and scooped it up. The retail giant only held on to Napster for a few years before selling to Rhapsody in 2011 . Rhapsody tried to make Napster a household name in Europe for the next decade before a consortium of blockchain companies, led by Hivemind and Algorand, bought it in 2022 . These companies had plans to do some kind of NFT-based nonsense, because “music x web3 is one of the most exciting spaces.” That didn’t work and, well, here we are. Here’s to another 25 years of being passed around like a hot potato. Update, March 26 2025, 10:43AM ET: This story was updated with more details about Infinite Reality&#39;s plans for Napster.

    "description": "As someone who paid full price for Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM5 headphones , I am jealous to report that they are 20 percent off right now as part of Amazon&#39;s Spring Sale . Yes, our choice for 2025&#39;s best wireless headphones have dropped to $318 from $400 — a 20 percent discount. They briefly dropped to $250 earlier in the sale, but have since jumped back up a bit. Nevertheless, this is a good sale price overall; you can grab them on discount in either the silver of smoky pink colors. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones are one of them. I&#39;ve raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they&#39;re so comfortable. I&#39;ve worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time.&nbsp; Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they&#39;re a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don&#39;t have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive).&nbsp; Their excellence on flights isn&#39;t the only reason we gave Sony&#39;s XM5 headphones a 95 in our review . They&#39;re also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound&#39;s quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don&#39;t fold up, but especially at this price, they&#39;re still such a great buy.&nbsp; This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don&#39;t quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

    "description": "Microsoft has launched two new &quot;reasoning agents&quot; for Copilot that were designed to analyze vast amounts of work data, including emails, meetings, chats and documents. The first tool called &quot;Researcher&quot; is based on OpenAI&#39;s deep research model combined with Copilot&#39;s advanced orchestration and deep search capabilities. Researcher was made for &quot;complex, multi-step research&quot; at work. It can take a user&#39;s internal work data along with additional information from the web, such as competitive data, emerging trends and the latest market analysis, to create market strategies and comprehensive quarterly reports, among other potential uses. Plus, it can pull data from Salesforce, ServiceNow and other external sources. Meanwhile, the new &quot;Analyst&quot; tool was built to function like a skilled data scientist. It&#39;s based on OpenAI&#39;s o3-mini reasoning model and uses &quot;chain-of-thought reasoning&quot; to solve issues in multiple steps to provide answers that Microsoft says &quot;mirror human analytical thinking.&quot; It can process raw data across multiple spreadsheets to, say, predict future revenue and expenses, forecast demand for a new product and visualize the purchasing patterns of customers. For the most complex data queries, it can run Python, and users will be able to view the code while it&#39;s running in real time.&nbsp; Both Researcher and Analyst will be rolling out to customers with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license starting in April as part of &quot;Frontier.&quot; Customers enrolled to the new Frontier program will get access to Copilot technologies while they&#39;re still in development, starting with these two new tools.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-deep-research-and-analysis-tools-for-copilot-143001894.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Noble Audio FoKus Apollo review: The high price of pristine audio",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html?src=rss",
    "description": "I don’t review a lot of $650 headphones . That’s because most audio companies sell their top-of-the-line gear around $300-$400. Noble Audio isn’t like most companies. The FoKus Rex5 earbuds, for example, cram in five separate drivers where much of the competition uses two at the most. Noble was also among the first to employ xMEMS drivers in wireless earbuds in a bid to improve bass performance. Enter the FoKus Apollo , a $649 pair of active noise canceling (ANC) headphones with a detachable boom mic and up to 80 hours of battery life. The real star of the show is the driver setup , which Noble says is the first time this configuration appears in wireless headphones. The company is once again on a quest for the absolute best sound quality, but it may sacrifice a little too much along the way. Sound quality is the main attraction Noble Audio’s proposition is simple: the “world’s first” headphones that offer a hybrid speaker pairing of a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar magnetic driver. A dynamic driver is nothing new for a set of cans, but adding the latter makes the FoKus Apollo’s audio setup unique. For the uninitiated, planar magnetic drivers have a thin, flat diaphragm that typically offers a wider, more immersive soundstage and enhanced detail compared to dynamic drivers. Planar magnetic drivers are typically reserved for audiophile-grade headphones since they’re larger and more fragile. With the FoKus Apollo, Noble capitalized on the best of both worlds for the stock tuning. You get the bass power of a dynamic driver with the clarity of a planar magnetic driver. Since planar magnetic units can’t move enough air for the robust bass that most of us crave, and as dynamic drivers are limited with mid- and high-range details, the company argues it has created the optimal solution. From the first second of the first song, I could tell the FoKus Apollo was built differently. The addition of planar magnetic drivers offers the most bass-heavy genres an almost absurd amount of detail. Albums like Spiritbox’s Tsunami Sea that lack clarity on other headphones greatly benefit from the treble boost, serving up more nuance in the guitar riffs and texture in the kick drum blasts. The FoKus Apollo also excels with mellow styles, allowing you to hear every bit of sound coming from the acoustic guitars, banjo, bass and more on Julien Baker &amp; TORRES’ “Sugar in the Tank.” Going from most over-ear headphones to the FoKus Apollo is like going from standard music streaming to vinyl. And I don’t think that’s hyperbole. FoKus Apollo in-use: ANC, battery life and more Billy Steele for Engadget A pair of $649 ANC headphones better damn well provide some decent noise cancellation, even if you’re primarily buying them for the audio performance. Noble opted for a hybrid ANC setup with three microphones on each side and a Qualcomm QCC3084 chip. That processor provides the necessary digital signal processing (DSP) and algorithms to reduce background distractions. Like a lot of ANC headphones, the FoKus Apollo struggles with voices. That means any hopes of silencing a chatty colleague won’t pan out. However, the headphones do a solid job with constant noise sources — fans, appliances, noise machines, etc. — so they do offer some relief. The noise-blocking prowess isn’t as good as the likes of Bose , but I found ample room to focus during my test sessions. While the ANC here isn’t among the best, it’s perfectly serviceable in most environments. Noble promises a whopping 60 hours of battery life with ANC enabled, with another 20 hours of use if you turn it off. I found that those figures hold true during my time with the FoKus Apollo. After 30 hours of music, podcasts and work calls with noise cancellation active, the headphones still had 57 percent battery remaining — tracking slightly better than the company’s stated numbers. The Fokus Apollo comes with all the accessories you’d ever need right in the box. Noble includes a detachable boom mic, 3.5mm to 4.4mm adapter, two-prong airline adapter, USB-C cable and 3.5mm aux cable. The headphones can be used with either of those two cords, and the company recommends you do so when employing the microphone for optimal voice quality. If you’re planning to use the Fokus Apollo for calls, you can expect mixed results. In quiet spaces with little echo, you’ll sound good enough for a professional presentation. When you move to a room with some natural reverb, the mics on these headphones pick that up a little too well. What’s more, they’re not great at blocking background sounds, as fans, white noise machines and raucous appliances were all clearly heard on the other end during my tests. Design that matches the sound The FoKus Apollo is really expensive, so Noble couldn’t just give us a set of headphones built mostly out of plastic and call it a day. Thankfully, the company chose a mix of anodized aluminum, premium protein leather and a soft Alcantara headband. The leather-wrapped memory foam ear pads are replaceable, which will extend the life of the headphones under heavy use. There’s also a nice textured cloth pattern on the outside of the ear cups and headband that provide both tactile and visual contrast. Noble Audio provides physical controls on the FoKus Apollo, so you’ll never have to struggle with tap or touch gestures to make changes. On the right side, there’s a dedicated button for ANC modes (on, off and transparency) with a three-control array just below it. Here, the top and bottom buttons handle the volume and track adjustments while the center one is used for power, Bluetooth pairing, play/pause and to summon Google Assistant, Siri or some other virtual helper. On the left ear cup, a single slider allows you to mute all the microphones, even the boom when it’s attached, without reaching for your phone or keyboard. The lack of advanced features Billy Steele for Engadget The FoKus Apollo is really only focused on the basics, so it doesn’t offer any of today’s advanced features. Heck, there aren’t even tools that have been on other sets for years — like wear detection. Although you’ll get support for Sony’s LDAC codec along with AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC, there’s no mention of Dolby Atmos or any form of spatial audio. You don’t find any discussion of adaptive audio or adaptive ANC that makes automatic adjustments to both overall sound and noise cancellation either. Look, I’m well aware the premise here is pristine sound quality above all else. But at $649, which is $100 more than the AirPods Max by the way, I expect some degree of convenience that allows me to keep these headphones on for most of the day. Automatic pausing or wear detection should be standard at this price and it would be nice to have some additional sound/ANC options. I’m not picky about whether those are the automatic, adaptive type, or whether they’re settings I have to toggle on in the app. Just, please, give me something more than EQ adjustments when your sound out of the box is already incredible. The competition Once you hit $500 and above, you’ve surpassed what most companies charge for their flagship-level wireless headphones. You’re also in a price range where I’ve only reviewed a handful of models. If money is no object, the $699 Px8 from Bowers &amp; Wilkins delivers excellent sound quality in a design that might be preferable to some folks (there’s at least multiple color options). Its ANC performance isn’t earth shattering either, and one of my biggest gripes with the company’s products is the lack of advanced features like the FoKus Apollo. There’s also the AirPods Max and Dyson On-Trac , but neither of those are easy to recommend. Apple’s over-ear headphones have barely been updated since they arrived in 2020, except for an upgrade to USB-C and the upcoming addition of lossless audio . Dyson’s headphones have long battery life and a unique design, but they didn’t impress me sound-wise, have average ANC performance and lack the modern features I expect for $500. I also need to mention Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW75 in the over-$500 discussion. If you’re after high-end looks, no other company consistently nails its trademark aesthetic like M&amp;D. True to its lineage, the company pairs leather and metal on these headphones, along with tempered glass panels on the outside of the earcups. I’ve always enjoyed the balance of M&amp;D’s stock tuning and the ANC performance is solid. You won’t get any advanced features here either, but like the Px8, there are multiple color options if you’re after something other than Noble’s black and silver paint scheme. Wrap-up I have no doubts there are a lot of people that will thoroughly enjoy the FoKus Apollo . If you crave the absolute best sound quality on the market, these headphones are the best I’ve tested in that regard. For me, to pay $649 I expect more in terms of features. The first item would be better ANC performance, but I don’t feel like spatial audio support and wear detection are too much to ask. Even without any of that, you do get a novel driver setup that produces some ridiculously detailed sound across diverse genres.

    "title": "iPad (2025) with A16 review: No Apple Intelligence, no problem",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html?src=rss",
    "description": "When it debuted in 2022, Apple’s 10th-generation iPad sat in something of a no-man’s land, bringing a long-overdue design revamp at an inflated price. A year and a half later, Apple gave the slate a $100 price cut and immediately turned it into a much more enticing value . Now, the company has quietly released a follow-up. Dubbed the iPad (A16) , the new tablet is a far less dramatic update, one with welcome performance improvements that otherwise refuses to rock the boat. It even lacks the Apple Intelligence features Apple has endlessly promoted over the past year. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Compared to the iPad Air, iPad Pro and iPad mini, this might be the easiest Apple tablet to grok — it’s the cheapest, it only comes in one size and it’s clearly designed for the core iPad Things. That doesn’t make it a slam dunk, though. What hasn’t changed Almost everything about the latest iPad is identical to the previous entry-level iPad from 2022, which brought many of the iPad Air’s features down to a lower price. The design is unchanged, with the same dimensions, weight, bezels, display and aluminum finish as before. Apple now lists the screen as being 11 inches instead of 10.9 inches, but it’s merely rounding up for marketing purposes — the size is no different. There are still competent 12-megapixel cameras on the front and back, with the selfie cam conveniently located along the device’s long edge for FaceTime calls. The same reliable Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the power button in lieu of Face ID. Two speakers, one on either end, sit behind a (misleading) quartet of grilles, while a lone USB-C port continues to max out at basic USB 2.0 transfer speeds. There’s no difference in accessory support either, and the whole thing is available in the same bold colors: blue, pink, yellow or silver. Battery life, meanwhile, still checks in at around 10 hours per charge, give or take a few depending on how you push it. I got 11 hours and 19 minutes out of the slate after playing a 1080p movie on loop at roughly 70 percent brightness and volume (and with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth disabled). Gaming and media editing will naturally sap it faster. Most of this is still perfectly fine for a $349 tablet. The last iPad was a light and comfortable slab, with a substantial aluminum finish and flat sides that made it feel modern. This one is no different. And iPadOS is still a level above Android and Windows tablets when it comes to app and game support, long-term updates and features optimized for large displays. But if the 10th-gen iPad was a “tick” update, the iPad (A16) is clearly a “tock.” That said, there are some important changes, namely a faster chip, more memory and higher storage options, plus a few minor tweaks like Smart HDR 4 processing for photos and support for Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.2. It’s a spec bump through and through, with most of those tweaks being for the better, although I do think that some of the things that haven’t been touched could really use an update next time. A faster chip and more RAM As the name implies, the latest iPad’s headline upgrade is its A16 chip. This is a slightly weaker version of the A16 Bionic found in 2022’s iPhone 14 Pro and the regular iPhone 15 from 2023. Compared to that SoC, this A16 has five CPU cores instead of six and four GPU cores instead of five. But in practice, it’s still more than fast enough for the vast majority of things people do with iPads: browsing the web, streaming video, reading ebooks, viewing and editing photos, playing most games and the like. I tested this iPad against my personal 13-inch iPad Air M2 for much of this review, and the two consistently booted up and loaded popular apps at virtually the same speed. The few times the Air M2 was quicker, the difference wasn’t long enough to be significant. Geekbench 6 results back this up: The iPad (A16) earned a single-core CPU score of 2,582, while the iPad Air M2 was only marginally better at 2,632. This is a roughly 20 percent jump from the 10th-gen iPad, though the most recent iPad Air M3 still measures about 16-18 percent faster. But for media consumption and common work tasks, it won’t feel slow anytime soon. These performance gains are helped by the 6GB of RAM, which is 2GB more than the last model and twice as much as the 9th-gen iPad from 2021. While this is still 2GB short of the iPad Air and lower-spec iPad Pros, getting more memory for the same price is always a good thing: It lets the tablet hang onto apps and Safari tabs longer before it has to start refreshing things for new tasks. It will only improve the chances of the device holding up four or five years down the road, too. Where the iPad (A16) lags behind its higher-end siblings is multi-core and graphics performance. In Geekbench 6, the tablet’s multi-core CPU score was about 40 percent below the iPad Air M2 (6,185 vs. 10,006), while its GPU score was about 55 percent worse (19,448 vs. 42,920). Other graphics benchmarks were largely the same: It scored about 60 percent lower than the Air M2 in 3DMark’s Wild Life Extreme test (with an average of 15.2 fps vs. 37.6 fps) and anywhere between 45 to 55 percent worse on GFXBench ’s Aztec Ruins benchmark, depending on the resolution. Of course, the difference will be a little greater with the newer iPad Air M3. This sounds more dramatic on paper than it does in real life. Many everyday iPad workloads won’t tax the chip’s multi-core abilities all that hard, and the scores above are still a good 15 to 30 percent higher than the last entry-level iPad. I could still play Call of Duty Mobile at its highest settings (120 fps mode aside) without any hitches. Diablo Immortal warned that maxing out its settings would put the device under “high” load — with the Air M2, it only goes up to “medium” load — but I still got through the opening areas totally fine. (It does seem to drain the battery a bit faster, though.) You can still edit RAW photos in Lightroom or create music in GarageBand without major frustration. The iPad (A16) on top of a 13-inch iPad Air. Still, the Air is better if you ever want to push things further. This is easiest to see in the newest and most taxing iPadOS games. With Infinity Nikki , for instance, playing at ultra or high settings on the new iPad brought a constant bit of choppiness and some slowdowns during more involved animations. It also warmed up the device’s back and drained the battery faster. The game was still totally playable at medium settings, but there’s less need to knock it down on the iPad Air M2, where it looked sharper and ran smoother at high settings. Likewise, the Air will be noticeably quicker to export higher-res videos in apps like Adobe Premiere Rush. Arguably, the main benefit of the iPad Air’s M-series chip and extra RAM has less to do with today than it does the future. Features like Apple Intelligence and the Stage Manager multitasking mode aren’t available here, nor are some especially demanding games . Those aren’t essential right now — though omitting Stage Manager does make the device more cumbersome to use with an external display — but there’ll always be some risk that the next great iPadOS feature or power-hungry game won’t work (or work as well ) with this entry-level model. More storage — hallelujah The best improvement with the iPad (A16) is also the simplest: It now starts with 128GB of storage, which is twice as much as the last model. There’s also a new 512GB option for $649. There isn’t much to say about this besides “good.” It’s a common-sense upgrade that makes the tablet a much safer long-term investment than its predecessor, especially when there’s no hope of Apple ever letting us upgrade storage manually. A fine display, but it’s time to improve In his iPad Air M3 review , my colleague Nathan Ingraham argued that it’s time for Apple to update the Air’s display with a higher refresh rate or a mini LED panel , as the OLED tech exclusive to the iPad Pros represents a major upgrade on its own. Since the iPad (A16)’s screen is no different than the last one, I want to make a follow-up case for the entry-level model, albeit on a smaller scale. It&#39;s much easier to see in person than through photos, but if you look at the bottom corner of the display, near the bezel, you can see the air gap between the iPad&#39;s LCD panel and front glass. Out of context, the IPS display here is still totally adequate. It’s comfortably sized, it’s sharp enough, it’s not a massive smudge magnet and it doesn’t have any serious color accuracy issues. A tablet is nothing if not a big display, and most of the people Apple is targeting with this one will still enjoy watching and reading stuff on it. I can also live with the 60Hz refresh rate — that’s the minimum in 2025, but it’s a harsher limitation on a $599 ( or $799 ) tablet like the iPad Air than a $349 device. The other restrictions are more annoying. This screen still isn’t laminated, most notably, which means there’s a visible air gap between the LCD panel and the glass above. This helps the screen’s repairability but makes it look cheaper and feel more distant when you interact with the glass. This is particularly discernible with the Apple Pencil: Writing out notes on the iPad Air is both quieter and more natural. Those who’ve never used a higher-end iPad probably won’t care, but once you notice the difference, you can’t unsee it. The display also lacks an anti-reflective coating, so it’s worse at fending off glare. It’s certainly not unusable outdoors, but you’ll see your reflection much more clearly on the iPad (A16) than you will on the iPad Air M2 in sunlight. You’re much more likely to have to angle its display to make things out. Unlike the iPad Air and iPad Pro, the base iPad isn’t tuned for the wider P3 color space either. While the difference in color reproduction between the iPad Air and iPad (A16) is nowhere near as dramatic as the one between the Air and the iPad Pro, colors on the Air can still look slightly bolder and less washed-out when you put the two side-by-side. I appreciate that Apple wants to keep its “good, better, best” hierarchy intact, but at this point the iPad Pro’s display is so far ahead of the rest of the lineup that there’s room to even things out. If the next Air can upgrade to 120Hz, as Nathan suggests, then the next entry-level iPad should at least have a laminated display with better glare protection. Those aren’t premium features anymore. The USB-C Pencil can attach magnetically but lacks wireless charging and pressure sensitivity, so it&#39;s not a great choice for more involved work. Continued weirdness with accessories Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard support is another ongoing pain point. Like its predecessor, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with the Pencil Pro (Apple’s best stylus) or the older, second-gen Pencil. That means the only stylus you can buy with pressure sensitivity — a key feature for digital artists that lets you make darker marks by pressing down harder — is the original Pencil, which is nearly a decade old (!), isn’t as comfortable as the newer models and can’t attach to the tablet magnetically. It also requires a USB-C cable and a USB-C to Lightning adapter to charge. All of this is bad . You can still get the $79 USB-C Pencil , which is nicer to hold and can attach to the iPad’s side magnetically but isn’t pressure-sensitive and still requires a separate cable to pair and charge. Really, though, most people who want an iPad for drawing should start with the iPad Air. I’ve never been a big fan of this iPad’s Magic Keyboard Folio either, as its Surface-style kickstand is hard to keep stable on your lap and it lacks backlit keys. That’s tough given its exorbitantly high price of $249. Not built for Apple Intelligence, but that’s OK (for now) As noted above, the iPad (A16) isn’t compatible with Apple Intelligence, which is Apple’s catch-all term for the suite of generative AI features it’s gradually rolled out since late last year. In fact, it’s the only major device Apple has released without the AI tools since they became available. Right now, though, you won’t miss much without them. Sure, the “ Clean Up ” feature that lets you scrub unwanted objects from photos is nice. Some of the writing-assistance tools are fine if you’re completely out of gas, and being able to access ChatGPT through Siri is convenient. But just as many of the tricks are either half-cooked or, let’s say, less than essential . A promised Siri revamp has been significantly delayed . If anything, many people will appreciate that their tablet won’t push AI onto them with every update. There’s always a chance Apple Intelligence becomes more useful down the road, and buying the iPad (A16) means locking yourself out of that potential future. But it’s not there yet , and Apple is reportedly well aware of that, so we can’t call it a major omission today. Wrap-up The iPad (A16) isn’t a massive leap forward from the last entry-level iPad, and some of its display and accessory quirks are getting long in the tooth. We still recommend stepping up to the iPad Air if you can swing it: It’s faster and more futureproof, with small but meaningful upgrades to the screen, better accessory support and speakers that sound less compressed. It’s also worth the upgrade if you want to use your iPad as a pseudo laptop replacement without spending top dollar. If you see a great deal on refurbished iPad Air M2 , that’s a good buy as well. But for $250 less than the latest Air, the iPad (A16) does well to meet most iPad users where they live. It’s largely well-built and plenty quick for reading, watching and playing things, with solid battery life and an eternally easy-to-use OS. If you’re upgrading from a 9th-gen iPad or older, buying for a kid or just looking for a competent slate you won’t use for hours every day, it should be plenty of tablet for your needs. It’s not the most delightful iPad, but it’s good enough for the masses.

    "description": "Block has laid off 931 workers, which make up around eight percent of its entire staff, according to TechCrunch and The Guardian . The publications have viewed an email, wherein the financial technology company&#39;s co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, has discussed the latest organizational changes. Dorsey said that Block is eliminating roles based on three areas, starting with strategy. The company is letting 391 people go, because it&#39;s reducing &quot;teams that are off strategy.&quot; It&#39;s also parting ways with 460 workers who scored a &quot;below&quot; rating or are trending towards a &quot;below&quot; rating in its internal performance tracking metrics. Finally, Block is laying off 80 managers, as well as moving 193 to individual contributor roles, to flatten the organization and remove layers of middle management between workers and the high-level bosses they&#39;d now have to report to. In his email, Dorsey denied that the layoffs were made to hit any specific financial target and headcount goal, or because the company was replacing workers with artificial intelligence. He said that it was all about strategy and because flattening its org will allow it to &quot;move faster and with less abstraction.&quot; The CEO admitted, however, that everyone in Block has equity in the company and that the reorganization &quot;will help [it] focus and execute better to do just that.&quot; Block&#39;s stock prices have plummeted by around 30 percent this year.&nbsp; Dorsey explained that the company is laying off nearly 1,000 workers all at once instead of over time, because it&#39;s behind in its actions. &quot;We need to move to help us meet and stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in,&quot; he wrote. In addition to the layoffs, Block is also closing 748 previously open jobs and is only leaving key leadership and critical roles, along with those that have already progressed to offer stage, open. Block, which owns Square and Cash App, also underwent a reorganization in early 2024. It laid off nearly 1,000 people back then, as well, to make the company leaner and to limit its headcount to around 12,000 workers. As TechCrunch notes, Block had around 11,300 workers around the world by December 2024, which means its headcount is now far below the original goal it set for itself in 2023.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/block-reportedly-lays-off-almost-1000-employees-130056952.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best language learning apps for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-language-learning-app-120001600.html?src=rss",
    "description": "There’s a good chance learning a new language is one of your New Year’s resolutions, unless you’re hoping Google Translate will be enough for your next international adventure. Either way, you’ll need a reliable method to guide you through speaking and understanding the foreign language of your choosing. Fortunately, we're no longer confined to flashcards and textbooks as you can learn using your phone from the comfort of your couch. Many of the best language learning apps today offer a multi-tier approach, with AI-powered conversations, extensive vocab libraries and even podcasts you can listen to to help you master your target language. Whether you're just starting because you're just trying to understand what Bad Bunny means when he says \"un verano en Nueva Yol ,\" or you want to brush up on your Korean before that planned vacation, there’s a language learning app to suit your needs. Best language learning apps for 2025 Others language learning apps we tested Memrise Memrise has a library of more than 200 languages to learn. From Spanish to isiXhosa, Memrise can teach you all the basics and dive into more regional differences. As a Spanish learner, I could choose to learn from Spain or Mexico and I enjoyed that Memrise didn’t just teach me a more generalized version of the language. While Memrise could be great for polyglots, its hefty $60 monthly fee was too steep and prevented it from gleaning one of our top slots. Pimsleur Dr. Pimsleur believed speaking and listening were key to learning a new language. This app allows you to take its audio lessons offline, even going as far as integrating into Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. As a commuter, I appreciated having a lesson or two stored away for my journey to the office. However, I wanted more ways to practice reading and writing. With other apps offering podcasts for listening along and other forms of teaching, Pimsleur didn’t offer enough to make our list. Rosetta Stone Gone are the large, yellow disc sets of yesteryear; now Rosetta Stone lives squarely in the digital age with its app. Using the same visual learning tools as the old-school Rosetta Stone, the app shows you pictures and terms to get you to understand what things mean. Users can repeat after voice recordings and match phrases to the images to learn slowly. Rosetta Stone could be great for beginners, but in order to get access to all 25 languages and a lifetime subscription, you’d have to dish out $400. There are cheaper apps on this list that provide comparable experiences. HelloTalk Similar to Discord, HelloTalk provides voice and chat rooms to talk to folks from different countries. Its users can learn regional terms and talk about cultural differences. With a paid subscription, you can practice with a tutor or their AI chatbot. If you’re looking to learn a new language outside of your inner circle, HelloTalk can be a great fit. I enjoyed connecting with others on the app, but, as always when meeting strangers online, beware — some users treat it like a dating app. Fortunately, there are apps on this list that offer a similar AI learning approach without that added concern. How we test language learning apps As an intermediate Spanish learner, I was looking for an app that best catered to my needs, but I know everyone learns differently. So for each app, I assessed based on several factors. Can beginners use this to gain confidence? Will advanced speakers feel challenged? Are there enough opportunities to test reading and writing skills? How many ways can you learn vocabulary words? For those who want to have more conversations, what opportunities did each app provide to speak in that language? Bonus points if an app helped you learn a bit of the culture surrounding that language.

    "title": "The best headphones for running in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Whether you’re already an avid runner or hope to be one as you start a new training regimen, you’ll get more out of your exercise routine if you have some good music to accompany you. Getting into the zone during a long run with your preferred music, be it rap, classic rock or today’s pop hits, can totally change your experience for the better. To do that, you have to start with a good pair of running headphones. But not all wireless workout headphones are created equally, and runners need to consider specific factors before investing in a pair like how long your runs are, what type of music or other audio you prefer listening to and how much you want to block out the world during a session. I’ve tested out more than a dozen pairs to find which are the best headphones for running for all budgets and all kinds of runners. Table of contents Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones How we test headphones for running Others headphones for running we tested Best headphones for running in 2025 What to look for in running headphones Design Before diving in, it’s worth mentioning that this guide focuses on wireless earbuds . While you could wear over-ear or on-ear Bluetooth headphones during a run, most of the best headphones available now do not have the same level of durability. Water and dust resistance, particularly the former, is important for any audio gear you plan on sweating with or taking outdoors, and that’s more prevalent in the wireless earbuds world. Most earbuds have one of three designs: in-ear, in-ear with hook or open-ear. The first two are the most popular. In-ears are arguably the most common, while those with hooks promise better security and fit since they have an appendage that curls around the top of your ear. Open-ear designs don’t stick into your ear canal, but rather sit just outside of it. This makes it easier to hear the world around you while also listening to audio, and could be more comfortable for those who don’t like the intrusiveness of in-ear buds. Water resistance and dust protection Water resistance and dust protection are crucial for the best running headphones to have since you’ll likely be sweating while wearing them. Also, if you have the unfortunate luck of getting caught in the rain during a run, at least your gear will survive. Here’s a quick rundown of ingress protection (IP) ratings, which you’ll see attached to many earbuds on the market today. The first digit after the abbreviation rates dust protection on a scale from one to six — the higher, the better. The second digit refers to water- resistance, or waterproofing in some cases, ranked on a scale from one to nine. A letter “X” in either position means the device isn’t rated for the corresponding material. Check out this guide for an even more detailed breakdown. All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating (most have even more protection), which means they can withstand sweat and splashes but do not have dust protection. Active noise cancellation and transparency mode Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming a standard feature on wireless earbuds, at least in those above a certain price. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and continue to serve you when you’re off the trail, ANC is good to have. It adds versatility by allowing you to block out the hum of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute on public transit. But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand in hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many earbuds with ANC support some sort of “transparency mode” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for running headphones because you don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re exercising outside along busy streets. Lowering noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that. Battery life All of the earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most runners, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session. Speaking of, you’ll get an average of 20-28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a wireless charger to power up. How we test headphones for running When testing to determine the best running headphones, I wear each contender during as many runs as possible. I typically run three to five days each week, completing at least a 5K (3.01 miles) each time. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you’re on the tread or trail (as a note, I primarily run outside). I’m also paying attention to fit over time, particularly if the earbuds get slippery or loose while I sweat, or if they tend to pop out or feel less stable in my ears as I pick up speed or make quick movements. I also use the earbuds when not running to take calls and listen to music, podcasts and the like throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities. While I am also listening for audio quality, I’m admittedly not an expert in this space. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about sound quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and buying guides . Here, however, I will make note of audio-quality characteristics if they stood out to me (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’re able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases. A note about Jabra headphones Jabra announced that it will exit the consumer earbuds business , which is disappointing considering the company has made excellent headphones for running (and all other types of exercise). Our top picks include two Jabra models and we feel comfortable recommending them still because Jabra plans to support its current earbuds for &quot;several years.&quot; However, we&#39;re constantly testing new buds and reassessing our top picks, so we&#39;ll update this list accordingly in the future. Others headphones for running we tested Apple AirPods Pro The Apple AirPods Pro have an IP54 rating, which protects them from brief encounters with dust and splashes. While that’s more dust protection than many other earbuds we tested, it’s the same level of water-resistance that most exercise-specific competitors have. We generally like the AirPods Pro, but the Beats Fit Pro offer many of the same features and conveniences (namely good transparency mode and the H1 chip), with a design that’s more appropriate for working out. Beats Powerbeats Pro The Powerbeats Pro are a good alternative to the Beats Fit Pro if you’re a stickler for a hook design. However, they cost $50 more than the Fit Pro (although they’re often hovering around $180) and don’t offer any significant upgrades or additional features aside from their design. They’re also quite old at this point (having launched in 2019) and it appears Beats is putting more effort into updating its newer models instead. Anker Soundcore AeroFit Pro The Soundcore AeroFit Pro is Anker’s version of the Shokz OpenFit, but I found the fit to be less secure and not as comfortable. The actual earbuds on the AeroFit Pro are noticeably bulkier than those on the OpenFit and that caused them to shift and move much more during exercise. They never fell off of my ears completely, but I spent more time adjusting them than I did enjoying them. JBL Endurance Peak 3 The most noteworthy thing about the Endurance Peak 3 is that they have the same IP68 rating as the Jabra Elite 8 Active, except they only cost $100. But, while you get the same protection here, you’ll have to sacrifice in other areas. The Endurance Peak 3 didn’t blow me away when it came to sound quality or comfort (its hook is more rigid than those on my favorite similarly designed buds) and their charging case is massive compared to most competitors.

    "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on Disney+ and Hulu, Audible, Max and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in. Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): This Amazon Spring Sale deal gives you access to Audible Premium Plus, which includes one credit each month that you can spend on any book you&#39;d like, along with listening access to thousands of other books, podcasts and Audible Originals. You also get to take part in Audible&#39;s exclusive member sales. The deal runs through April 30. Sling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange &amp; Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. Starz (six months) for $18 ($28 off): Starz&#39;s latest offer gives you six months of access for only $18, which shakes out to about $3 per month. This represents a 61-percent discount off the standard &quot;semi-annual&quot; plan, which puts six months of access up for $46. To get the offer, go to the Starz website and click on &quot;claim special offer.&quot; You&#39;ll have to provide your email address before the discounted rates appear. As an alternative, you could opt for the monthly plan discount, which is currently $3 per month for a total of three months. Paramount+ student discount - 50 percent off any plan: Ahead of March Madness , students can get half off any Paramount+ plan through April 8. To get the discount, scroll to the bottom of the Paramount+ homepage and click &quot;Get a 50% discount&quot; next to &quot;Are you a student?&quot; CBS shares broadcast rights with Warner Bros. Discovery this year for the men&#39;s tournament, so you&#39;ll be able to catch games on Paramount+ if you have the subscription tier that includes Showtime. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Fubo Essential for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, but Essential may be the best for most people. It offers access to 215 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. Note that regional sports content is not included here; you’ll have to go up to Pro or Elite plans for that. YouTube TV for $70/month for the first six months ($78 off): New subscribers can save a total of $78 when they sign up for YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Spotify student discount - Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. Hulu student discount - subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Max student discount - subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Sling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you&#39;ll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you&#39;ll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange &amp; Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+ and Hulu Duo Premium for $20/month : This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 47 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

    "description": "Gaming journalism stalwart Game Informer has risen from the ashes. More than thirty years after its debut issue back in August 1991, the media outlet was officially shut down by parent company GameStop in August 2024. Since then, the rights to Game Informer were acquired by Gunzilla Games and, in an all-to-rare win for today&#39;s media world, the entire team that worked for Game Informer at the time of its closure will return to their jobs. Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller posted the details about how the outlet was saved from the brink and noted that Gunzilla Games will be a hands-off boss. &quot;The new owners insisted on the idea of Game Informer remaining an independent editorial outlet,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They felt just as strongly as our team did that the only path forward was with an editorial group that made 100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so, without any influence from them or anyone else.&quot; “We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry,&quot; Gunzilla CEO and Co-Founder Vlad Korolov said . The website and its back catalog of content have been republished online. Game Informer &#39;s staff have also published reviews of more than two dozen games that came out during the site&#39;s hiatus and belatedly compiled their requisite best games of 2024 list. The print magazine is also expected to resume activity, and Miller said more details will be forthcoming about subscription and membership options. Gunzilla Games, which counts Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp among its leadership, made a battle royale shooter called Off the Grid and also developed the GUNZ blockchain platform.

    "description": "As it turns out, including a reporter in your national security leader group chat about military strikes isn&#39;t the only way to compromise sensitive information on Signal. NPR reported on Tuesday that, days after the Trump administration&#39;s preposterous and dangerous national security fumble , the Pentagon issued a warning against using the messaging app due to a phishing vulnerability. &quot;A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger application,&quot; a department-wide email obtained by NPR reads. &quot;Russian professional hacking groups are employing [Signal&#39;s] &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations.&quot; The publication says the memo states that Russian hacking groups are &quot;targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.&quot; A Signal spokesperson told NPR that the memo wasn&#39;t about Signal&#39;s security but about phishing attacks on the platform. So, if you&#39;re using the app, be especially mindful of attempts to trick you into linking devices to your account. Or simply communicate through different channels. The Pentagon directive follows a scandal that, at least in previous eras, would have ended the careers of a long list of high-profile officials. (In this one… who knows?) The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that a group of Trump administration national security officials inadvertently included him in a Signal group chat discussing military strikes in Yemen. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images The conversation included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, among others. They — with Goldberg essentially CC&#39;d — discussed the timing, targets and weapons involved in bombing Houthi sites in Yemen. A 2023 Department of Defense memo prohibited using mobile apps for even &quot;controlled unclassified information.&quot; NPR notes that military planning is many degrees more sensitive than that. And that doesn&#39;t even cover accidentally including a journalist in the conversation. The entire Atlantic article is worth a read, but a few gems from the chat include Hegseth&#39;s writing, &quot;I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It&#39;s PATHETIC.&quot; And, &quot;Nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.&quot; Adding to the &quot;It would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so dangerous&quot; nature of the fiasco, Hegseth went on camera to deny the chat&#39;s authenticity after the White House confirmed it. Although the fallout is still taking shape, here&#39;s an early taste. Watch below as retired US Navy captain and current US Senator Mark Kelly grills Gabbard and Ratcliffe on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

    "description": "We hear Signal is in the news . As longtime fans of the app, and secure messaging more broadly, we feel like it&#39;s our duty at Engadget to ensure you know how to use the software properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download Signal Signal is available on Android and iOS , as well as nearly every desktop operating system, including Windows and macOS. You can download the app by clicking one of the links provided above, or typing in &quot;Signal Messenger&quot; in your device&#39;s app store. Once you&#39;ve installed the app, proceed to set up an account using your phone number or an alias.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: If you want to install Signal on a workplace phone or computer, be sure to obtain approval from your employer; some organizations, such as the US government, either actively discourage or downright disallow use of the app.&nbsp; Create a new group Wonderful, you&#39;ve downloaded Signal! Now, to create a group chat, follow these steps:&nbsp; Tap the compose icon at the top of the interface.&nbsp; Select New Group. Add participants by selecting their name from your contact list, or inputting their username or phone number.&nbsp; Give your group a name (and a profile picture if you want).&nbsp; If the contents are especially sensitive, you may wish to enable Disappearing Messages and select an expiration time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&#39;re in the process of adding new participants to a group, be sure to verify you&#39;re adding the right people. &nbsp; Some useful tips I would also suggest making use of Signal&#39;s Permissions feature to limit who can invite people to your chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings.&nbsp; Scroll down and select Permissions. Under &quot;Add Members,&quot; tap Only Admins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways someone can join your group chat is through a group link or QR Code . For additional security, you can set it so that admins must approve group link invites before the invitee can join.&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Scroll down and select Group Link.&nbsp; Switch the toggle to on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you know exactly who you can trust, but the guy down the hall might not! If you tend to get mixed up on names easily, Signal allows you to assign nicknames to users. After all, no one wants a case of mistaken identity. Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to assign a nickname to.&nbsp; Type in a name. You can also add a note, say describing the person&#39;s profession, in case you need additional context.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicknames are only visible to you, so don&#39;t be embarrassed to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp; How to remove someone from your group chat Look, even the best of us can make mistakes. Thankfully, Signal makes it easy to remove someone from a conversation thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your group chat and tap the group name to view the chat settings. Under &quot;Members,&quot; select the name of the individual you want to remove.&nbsp; Tap Remove From Group.&nbsp; How to delete messages in a Signal group chat So you somehow got through all of the above steps, added someone you shouldn&#39;t have and sent information that a relative stranger likely shouldn&#39;t have seen. Lets be honest, you&#39;re an edge case. But there&#39;s still hope if you caught your mistakes early.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap and hold the message on mobile (or hover the message bubble on desktop), Select Delete. Select Delete for Everyone. Now there&#39;s less chance of, for instance, a record of your civil and perhaps even criminal mishaps being shared to a notable reporter in a form potentially open to legal discovery.&nbsp; Ultimately, no matter how secure the messaging platform, if what you need to talk about is very, very sensitive, it&#39;s probably best to just &quot; get everyone in a room together .&quot; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-add-someone-to-a-signal-group-chat-201430756.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed again. Publisher Paradox Interactive announced today that it is now targeting release in October 2025 instead of the first half of this year. &quot;Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date,&quot; the company said. Creating the sequel has been a trial of endurance that would test even an immortal undead&#39;s patience. Paradox parted ways with the game&#39;s original developer, Hardsuit Labs, in 2021. The Chinese Room, which made notable indie games Dear Esther and Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture , joined the project as developer in 2023. Today&#39;s update from offered some encouragement that the project is now in &quot;a late development stage,&quot; however it has decided to discontinue dev diaries that offered behind-the-scenes peeks at progress. The original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines game came out in 2004 after its own challenging development. Made by the now-shuttered Troika Studios, it was an story-driven game inspired by a tabletop RPG about several vampire clans in a modern-day Los Angeles. It was a commercial flop, but acquired a loyal audience over the years and even cultivated a community for mods and fan games .

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-uk-could-greenlight-direct-to-phone-satellite-services-this-year-183504094.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If you live in a rural area of the UK, you may soon be able to use your phone for satellite calls, messages and other standard data use. On Tuesday, the nation&#39;s telecom regulator, Ofcom, proposed using direct-to-device satellite tech to connect people in the UK&#39;s &quot;most rural and hard-to-reach places,&quot; like mountains and remote villages. Ofcom sees the tech complementing traditional networks, aiming to provide 100 percent mobile coverage in the UK. The regulator said the tech could also provide backup coverage during outages, offer service to ships and passengers in coastal waters without a connection and provide emergency 999 services (the UK&#39;s version of 911) in remote areas. In January, British telecom Vodafone made the world&#39;s first satellite video call using a standard mobile phone on a remote mountain in west Wales. Regarding the regulatory details, Ofcom suggests amending existing mobile spectrum licenses for frequencies already used by cellular providers (below 3 GHz). However, the regulator also offered alternative approaches, including introducing a new license for satellite services or allowing license-exempt use if certain conditions are met. Regardless of its specific policy approach, Ofcom said strict conditions would be attached to avoid interference with existing spectrum users in the UK and overseas. Ofcom is opening a consultation period with stakeholders from now to May 20. Depending on the feedback it receives, it could begin authorizing direct-to-device calls later this year.&nbsp; The iPhone 14 series was the first standard handset to offer direct-to-satellite emergency messaging . In iOS 18, Apple expanded the functionality beyond crises to any situation where you&#39;re off the grid . The Samsung Galaxy S25 series and Google Pixel 9 recently added similar functionality .

    "description": "Sunderfolk , a game that borrows elements from tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and couch party games like Jackbox, has a launch date. The fantasy RPG from Dreamhaven (the stomping ground of Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime ) arrives on April 23. You can play a demo today through April 7. While virtual tabletops like Wizards of the Coast&#39;s Sigil act as video game-like extensions of a traditional tabletop experience, Sunderfolk &#39;s premise is in using modern technology to simulate something like D&amp;D — but with more accessibility to casual players. Here, your phone becomes the deck of cards (and controller), while your TV or monitor is the game board. Although it supports remote play, this one sounds tailor-made for couch co-op. The game&#39;s story retreads familiar fantasy tropes, like a town of peaceful inhabitants invaded by dark and creepy monsters. Here, the heroes are a clan of anthropomorphic animals who each fit a familiar class like arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger or rogue. You can customize each with weapons, armor, items and skills as they level up. (When in doubt, play the classics!) Dreamhaven &quot;We were, with Sunderfolk, really trying to create something that would inspire people to get together in person,&quot; Game Director Erin Marek said in a preview trailer. &quot;We wanted it to feel similar to a game night, getting together to play a board game or getting together to play D&amp;D with a group of friends or family or loved ones that you really care about. And to share that experience together side-by-side.&quot; You can gather your cohorts to try the game for free on GeForce Now from now to April 7. The preview gives you access to all playable characters and an early part of the game. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need a paid GeForce membership ; a free account will do. Sunderfolk will cost $50 and be playable Steam , PS5 , Xbox Series X and Switch. But only the party member running the big-screen device needs to own the game; the phone app (iOS and Android) for your pals will be a free download when the game launches on April 23.

But the Elevation will also start at a lower price point, which could make it the most accessible of all the versions of the electric truck.</p>\n\n<div class=\"c-image-slider alignnone wp-block-vox-media-image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"c-image-slider__caption\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2026-GMC-Sierra-EV-02-AT4-Exterior.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2026-GMC-Sierra-EV-03-AT4-Towing.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.75214828329,100,78.49570343342\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2026-GMC-Sierra-EV-04-AT4-MidGate.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.096999040889,100,69.806001918222\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2026-GMC-Sierra-EV-05-AT4-Interior-FINAL.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.797321293259,100,78.405357413481\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2026-GMC-Sierra-EV-06-AT4-Seat-Detail.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.727784052735,100,78.544431894531\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2026-GMC-Sierra-EV-07-Elevation-On-Road.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.754547728508,100,78.490904542985\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2026-GMC-Sierra-EV-08-Elevation-Interior-FINAL.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.791767439078,100,70.416465121845\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">GMC is also offering a wider selection of battery options, including Standard, Extended, and Max Range packs. The Sierra Elevation will be available with a Standard or Extended Range battery, while AT4 will be available with an Extended or Max Range battery. The Denali trim will offer all three battery options. GMC said range estimates will be announced closer to launch. That said, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270895/the-2025-gmc-sierra-ev-denali-has-a-bit-more-range\">GMC has previously said</a> that Max Range batteries would get up to 460 miles of range.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The base model Elevation with Standard battery is now the most affordable Sierra EV, starting at $64,495. Above that is the Elevation with Extended Range at $72,695 and the premium Extended Range for $78,940. ATF models start at $81,395 and go all the way up to $91,695, depending on the battery pack. And the new base Denali will sell for $71,795, while the reserve Denali with Max Range battery will go for $100,695. (All prices include a $2,095 destination charge.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ATF will be the highest-riding Sierra, with 2 inches of additional lift thanks to lifted coil suspension and new 35-inch tires. ATF models will also share a number of features with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23591501/gmc-hummer-ev-review-photos-specs-price\">GMC’s Hummer EV</a>, such as four-wheel steer, CrabWalk, and Terrain Mode. But the automaker stressed that the two EVs don’t actually share any physical components.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

However, there are still a few unchecked boxes on fans&#8217; Switch 1 wishlist like, say, remasters of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em>, that could make an appearance.

The outward-facing camera on the Caper Carts will soon give stores an “understanding of inventory down to the store level,” allowing Instacart to update stock levels as often as every hour of the day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Along with Store View, Instacart is rolling out Second Store Check in the coming months, which Instacart bills as a way to “source out-of-stock items from another location” of the retailer you select. If you order an item but a shopper can’t find it in-store, Instacart will automatically prompt a second shopper to check if it’s available at another store. The second shopper will then deliver the item “for no additional service or delivery fee,” but it’s not clear whether you can tip them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It was a typical tawdry hour of reality TV. Clout-hungry influencer wannabes dressed to the nines, nursing their bruised egos and rehashing the minutiae of why their relationships crashed out in front of a global audience. Kind of ho-hum, actually. And then, cast member Zaina Sesay roused me from my cookie-induced stupor by upgrading her beef to the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&acirc;&#128;&#156;I have text message proof,&acirc;&#128;&#157; she said, smirking while beckoning over C-list celebrity host Nick Lachey with an outstretched thumb. &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have a chip on my nail.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cut to the camera zooming in on said microchip. After Lachey scanned it with his phone, a folder neatly titled &acirc;&#128;&#156;receipts&acirc;&#128;&#157; magically appeared. I switched out the cookies for popcorn. And with that, the studio audience, the whole of TikTok, and this reviewer collectively lost our minds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Never say you can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t find inspiration for a gadget review from trashy television.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap has-text-align-none\">Finding the smart nail chip was easy.

    "title": "Garmin adds AI and a subscription tier to its app",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/636211/garmin-connect-plus-subscription-wearables",
    "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"AI insights were inevitable. | Image: Garmin\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Garmin\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Garmin-Connect-hero-image.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption>AI insights were inevitable. | Image: Garmin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was only a matter of time. Garmin announced today it’s launching Garmin Connect Plus, a premium tier to its app that adds AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features. Existing and new Garmin users will be able to opt in to a free 30-day trial and then choose between a $6.99 monthly or $69.99 annual subscription. All existing health data and features, however, will remain free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Developing a premium tier enables us to extend our investment in the Garmin Connect platform, both in terms of features that carry additional cost to provide and also in scaling out our engineering teams to&nbsp;build and maintain these features,” says Garmin spokesperson Natalie Miller.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">AI is the big addition to Connect Plus. The feature, dubbed Active Intelligence, will roll out as a beta and purportedly delivers “personalized insights and suggestions” based on your health and activity data. Over time, the insights and goals are supposed to become more personalized to the individual user. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s about all the information Garmin has provided thus far about the AI-powered side of things, but it’s on trend for fitness apps and wearable makers lately. Whoop was first to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23888984/whoop-coach-chatgpt-ai-fitness\">add an AI training coach</a> in late 2023, while Strava also rolled out <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158290/strava-ai-dark-mode-night-heat-maps-family-subscription\">AI summaries for activities</a> last year. Among bigger tech companies, Samsung added <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">AI-powered insights</a> while Google added <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">AI-generated running workouts</a> to its smartwatches last year. Oura also has added <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-labs/\">an AI wellness chatbot</a> to its popular smart ring, as have several <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smartwatch-review/608342/amazfit-active-2-review-budget-smartwatch-wearables-fitness-tracker\">smaller</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259284/oura-ring-samsung-galaxy-ring-ultrahuman-ring-air-ringconn-circular-ring-evie-ring-review-wearables\">wearable makers</a> in the past two years. Garmin and Apple have thus far been the two major holdouts for wearable AI features, and with today’s announcement, that leaves just Apple.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Connect Plus also adds a new performance dashboard that lets users compare custom charts and graphs over a period of time to visualize progress. Subscribers will also be able to view live activity metrics on a smartphone for workouts that were started on a watch. LiveTrack will also be expanded so you can notify selected contacts when an activity starts and a personalized profile page for followers. People using Garmin Coach plans for running and cycling will also receive additional guidance from Garmin coaches. Lastly, there will be exclusive badges and frames for user’s app profiles.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Garmin_Connect-_SS_Running_Dashboard.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,27.088647245715,100,45.822705508569\" alt=\"Render of performance dashboards available for running with Garmin Connect Plus.

Technically you already have access to this data.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Garmin\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Garmin\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether this is enough value to tempt loyal Garmin users is another question — especially since Garmin has been vocal in the past about <em>not</em> paywalling features. Back in 2022, I asked Phil McClendon, Garmin’s project lead for the Venu 2 Plus, about the company’s philosophy regarding subscriptions. At the time, McClendon <a href=\"https://arc.net/l/quote/vihhjbgn\">told <em>The Verge</em></a>, “We’re not charging you the ability to access your data, and that’s something we will continue to do and that we feel very strongly about.” McClendon is no longer at Garmin, and technically this is still true since all existing features and data will remain free. However, in the years since that conversation, Garmin has occasionally softened its messaging regarding paywalls. At a 2023 press briefing for the Venu 3, Garmin leadership noted that the company had robust subscriptions outside its fitness tracker business but declined to say that there would <em>never</em> be a subscription.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Among fans, the lack of a subscription (outside of mapping features or LTE connectivity) has always been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/18mxyok/need_a_subscription_to_use_a_garmin/\">touted as a plus</a>. Especially since Garmin watches are, on average, more expensive than the competition. It’s hard to say how fans will react given that so much will remain free, but generally speaking, introducing subscriptions is a dicey proposition. Oura, for instance, experienced massive backlash when it introduced a subscription with its Gen 3 ring. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Either way, Garmin has faced increased competition these past years.

    "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Vivaldi-browser-proton-vpn.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vivaldi and Proton have teamed up to make it easier for Vivaldi browser users to privately explore the web without downloading a virtual private network (VPN). Starting today, the <a href=\"https://vivaldi.com/blog/privacy-without-compromise-proton-vpn-is-now-built-into-vivaldi/\">free version of Proton VPN is now integrated directly into Vivaldi’s browser</a>, and can be accessed by logging into a Vivaldi account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The feature is currently only available on the desktop version of the Vivaldi browser. <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn/free-vs-paid#pricing\">The free version of Proton VPN</a> allows users to connect to servers in five randomly selected countries and provides “medium VPN speed.” Vivaldi browser users can also upgrade to a paid version of Proton VPN starting from $10 per month, which provides faster VPN speeds, the ability to choose which servers to connect to across more than 110 countries, and other additional features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It isn’t unique for web browsers to have VPN features baked in — Microsoft bolstered its Edge browser <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/29/23049015/microsoft-free-built-in-vpn-edge-browser-edge-secure-network\">with the Edge Secure Network VPN</a>, for example. Proton VPN can also be readily embedded into other web browsers like Chrome and Firefox via downloadable browser extensions. That hurdle, however small, is removed for Vivaldi browsers users, which may make the VPN more accessible to a wider audience.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Vivaldi-proton-vpn.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,26.391312778747,100,47.217374442505\" alt=\"A screenshot showing Proton VPN running in Vivaldi’s web browser.\" title=\"A screenshot showing Proton VPN running in Vivaldi’s web browser.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The free version of Proton VPN comes as standard, but Vivaldi users can also upgrade to a paid tier to access more options.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Vivaldi\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Vivaldi\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vivaldi also said its partnership with Proton was founded in shared “values,” citing that both European companies are “proudly outside the orbit of Silicon Valley’s extractive playbook or China’s state-driven oversight.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“As governments and users alike reassess their relationship with tech, especially in light of escalating geopolitical tensions, there has been a huge increase in demand for independent, non-aligned, and values-driven solutions,” said Vivaldi CEO Jon Von Tetzchner. “Europe needs European alternatives. In fact, everybody deserves European alternatives. And with Vivaldi and Proton, you’re getting exactly that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Tetzchner says that both Vivaldi and Proton are “politically neutral,” the statement feels like an obvious nod to the fractures appearing between the US and Europe’s relationship since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350353/trump-bends-to-the-tech-oligarchy\">President Donald Trump took office</a> and surrounded himself with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345174/tech-leaders-companies-support-donald-trump-presidency\">leaders of market-dominating Tech Giants</a>. Bundling Vivaldi with privacy-focused freebies could be a viable lure to attract new customers who are already looking to switch to a non-US browser.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Kennedy International Airport. For a limited time, customers can grab a ride from specific stops in Manhattan or Brooklyn to JFK for just $10. After April 30th, the fare increases to $25, including taxes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Airport runs are a crucial part of Uber’s business, and customers have expressed frustration at the rising cost of booking a car to the airport. JFK, in particular, is one of the most expensive airports for travelers, with Uber and Lyft trips costing $80 or more, depending on the pickup location. By bundling riders together in a shuttle, Uber hopes to introduce a more affordable option to budget-conscious customers.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Uber-Shuttle_Homescreen-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Uber\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For JFK trips, customers can use the Uber app to book up to four seats in a shuttle. Rides can be booked up to seven days ahead of time or simply on the day you need it. Riders will get their pricing upfront before booking and won’t be subject to surge pricing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the shuttle arrives, riders will validate their reservation with the driver via QR code and a unique PIN. At launch, vehicles will be limited to just 14 passengers. Each rider is allowed one personal item, like a purse or backpack, and one piece of luggage (carry-on or checked) weighing up to 50 pounds. Riders can rate and tip drivers in the app, just like a normal Uber trip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Uber says it will operate four routes to JFK, with pickup locations at Port Authority, Grand Central Terminal, Chinatown, and Atlantic Center in Brooklyn. The service will run every 30 minutes from 5AM to 10:45PM, seven days a week. For its shuttle business, Uber is partnering with fleet providers who manage commercially licensed drivers. In New York, the company is using <a href=\"https://www.etsairportshuttle.com/\">ETS</a>, an airport shuttle operator since 1996.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Uber has been experimenting with shuttle service for airports and concerts, including <a href=\"https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/entertainment/2024/10/18/uber-taylor-swift-concert-hard-rock-stadium-shuttle/75730483007/\">$15 rides to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert in Miami</a> last year. The company also launched an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-shuttle-nyc-airport-review-photos-2024-10\">$18 shuttle to LaGuardia Airport</a> last year. (That price is now $20.) For airport trips, the company needs to negotiate terms with airport operators before a new service can be launched. Uber said it’s currently in talks with Boston’s Logan International Airport about bringing its shuttle service there.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

    "title": "Poco’s F7 Ultra is a midrange phone with a flagship chip",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/637088/poco-f7-ultra-pro-snapdragon-8-elite",

Very yellow.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Poco is releasing its first phone with “Ultra” branding, and on paper it lives up to the name. The F7 Ultra runs on the flagship <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273802/qualcomm-8-elite-oryon-cpu-android-smartphone-soc\">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, and combines it with a triple rear camera setup, 120W wired charging, and IP68 protection from dust and water. Despite those specs, it’s going on sale in the UK for £649 (around $835), making it one of the cheapest phones to use Qualcomm’s top tier chip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Xiaomi sub-brand Poco has always prioritized inexpensive handsets, but its F-series has been where it gets a little closer to the flagship space. The Snapdragon chip here is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, so performance should be excellent. Only the Redmagic 10 Pro offers the 8 Elite for less right now, but its gamer aesthetic is less likely to have broad appeal. Xiaomi’s software experience is substantially smoother too, and its promise of four Android updates compares pretty favorably to Redmagic’s commitment to… one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The F7 Ultra’s rear camera array includes a 50 megapixel main camera at a fast aperture of f/1.6, a 50MP 2.5x telephoto camera, and a 32MP ultrawide — plus another 32MP camera for selfies. I haven’t pushed the camera hard, but the few shots I have taken aren’t bad at all. There’s a little noise — worse if you push past the telephoto’s optical zoom into digital territory — but there’s detail, decent dynamic range, and true-to-life colors.</p>\n\n<div class=\"c-image-slider alignnone wp-block-vox-media-image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"c-image-slider__caption\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_163850.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The main camera does a great job in bright light.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_173736.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Getting into golden hour, the dynamic range impresses in this shot.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_173748.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 2.5x telephoto handles the light from this bulb well, separating every filament — and even the dust on the glass.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_163458.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The lighting is relatively kind here, but the F7 Ultra does well.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250326_163501.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 2.5x telephoto captures plenty of detail from these blossoms, and the texture of the building behind.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250327_091213.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Believe it or not, I took this shot in the dark.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dominic Preston / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Dominic Preston / The Verge\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_20250327_091221.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The telephoto handles low light surprisingly well too.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dominic Preston / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Dominic Preston / The Verge\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 6.67-inch OLED display has a 1440p resolution and max refresh rate of 120Hz, and the sizable 5,300mAh battery is supported by both 120W wired charging and 50W wireless charging.

It also gets a serious camera downgrade: the main shooter is the same, but it’s only accompanied by an 8MP ultrawide and a 20MP selfie camera, with no telephoto at all. Both models are available now in the UK and Europe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The company’s <strong>Drill Tool Set</strong> — which is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YTNLDJG\">Amazon</a> for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you own a newer Samsung Galaxy phone and need an alternative to AirTags, it’s worth considering the<strong> Galaxy SmartTag2</strong>, which is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCC69HN3/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-SmartTag2-Anti-loss-Bluetooth-tag-for-cellular-phone-white/5101078318/\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.chewy.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag2-bluetooth/dp/1453190\">Chewy</a> for $16.96 (about $13 off), its second-best price to date. It’s similar to Apple’s item trackers in that it uses ultra-wideband Bluetooth to provide pinpoint, compass-guided directions to your lost items. They can also tap into the Galaxy Find network and offer up to 500 days of battery life, or up to 40 percent longer in a low-power state.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, March 26th:</strong> Updated to reflect current pricing/availability and several new deals, including those for the Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener and Sharge’s Retractable 65 charger.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Google points to a raft of benchmarks that show the new Gemini clobbering other large language models (LLMs), and our testing seems to back that up—Gemini 2.5 Pro is one of the most impressive generative AI models we've seen.</p>\n<p>Gemini 2.5, like all Google's models going forward, has reasoning built in. The AI essentially fact-checks itself along the way to generating an output. We like to call this \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\">simulated reasoning</a>,\" as there's no evidence that this process is akin to human reasoning. However, it can go a long way to improving LLM outputs. Google specifically cites the model's \"agentic\" coding capabilities as a beneficiary of this process. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental can, for example, generate a full working video game from a single prompt. We've tested this, and it works with the publicly available version of the model.</p>\n<div class=\"ars-video\"><div class=\"relative\" allow=\"fullscreen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLCBSpgos6s?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent\"></div><div class=\"caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300\">\n    <div class=\"caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0\"></div>\n    <div class=\"caption-content\">\n      Gemini 2.5 Pro builds a game in one step.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Google says a lot of things about Gemini 2.5 Pro; it's smarter, it's context-aware, it <em>thinks</em>—but it's hard to quantify what constitutes improvement in generative AI bots. There are some clear technical upsides, though. Gemini 2.5 Pro comes with a 1 million token context window, which is common for the big Gemini models but massive compared to competing models like OpenAI GPT or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/\">Anthropic Claude</a>. You could feed multiple very long books to Gemini 2.5 Pro in a single prompt, and the output maxes out at 64,000 tokens. That's the same as Flash 2.0, but it's still objectively a lot of tokens compared to other LLMs.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

But Red Bulls' designers have been evolving a concept that even its former design boss <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/newey-considers-if-lack-of-experience-at-red-bull-contributed-to-recent-car.63B4wB6BZK35hqwjiIZcCN\">Adrian Newey</a> thinks <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/newey-considers-if-lack-of-experience-at-red-bull-contributed-to-recent-car.63B4wB6BZK35hqwjiIZcCN\">is flawed</a>, and in 2024, we saw Perez' form evaporate after the first handful of races that year.</p>\n<p>Verstappen was able to fight for the title thanks to his considerable skill in the car. But the team lost out to both McLaren <em>and</em> Ferrari in the constructors' standings, something that will have had a very considerable impact upon the end-of-year bonuses for Red Bull's hundreds of employees.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/red-bull-makes-up-its-mind-liams-out-yukis-in-for-japan/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/red-bull-makes-up-its-mind-liams-out-yukis-in-for-japan/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

Kennedy and Geier have both long touted the false claim that vaccines cause autism, despite the extensive evidence showing that they do not.

    "description": "日本初创企业“SPACE NTK”正开展用人造卫星将遗骨送入太空的“太空葬”服务。自 2022 年首次发射以来，他们已将约 20 人的遗骨、头发及留言卡送入太空。去年 12 月还运送了猫的遗骨。在墓葬形式多元化的当下，“化作星辰”这一新选择是否也能为人们所接受值得关注。该公司的太空葬将粉碎后的遗骨装入专用容器后装到人造卫星，通过 SpaceX 的火箭发射升空。卫星在距地约 500 至 600公 里高度分离后绕地球轨道运行。服务价格约为数克遗骨 55 万日元（约合人民币 2.7 万元），一具的话约为 1100 万日元。卫星在绕地运行数年后将坠入大气层，如流星般燃烧殆尽。下次发射时间预计为 2026 年春季。",

Hinton 正在为图像识别竞赛 ImageNet LSRVC 开发一种卷积神经网络。在当时图像识别是非常有挑战性的。研究人员认为他们需要一个庞大的神经网络，该网络以首席研究员的名字命名为 AlexNet，它有超过 6000 万参数和 65 万个神经元。但一大问题是如此大的神经网络如何进行训练？他们的实验室里有几张英伟达 GTX 580 显卡，每张配备了 3GB 显存，但 AlexNet 太大没办法加载到单张显卡上。研究人员设法将训练阶段划分到两张并行工作的 GPU 上——一半神经元在一张 GPU 上，另一半在另一张上运行。AlexNet 以压倒性优势赢得了 2012 年的比赛，从此 AI 模型的规模不再受限于单张显卡了，而妖精也从瓶子里释放了出来。在 AlexNet 之后，越来越强大的 AI 模型需要成千上万张 GPU。根据 Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)的报告，2010 年到 2020 年间数据中心的功耗相对平稳，原因是英伟达数据中心 GPU 的功耗同期提升了大约 15 倍，因此能保持数据中心功耗的稳定。到了 2022 年基于 transformer 的大模型的出现推动了数据中心功耗的大幅提升。大模型需要处理数百亿甚至数千亿个神经元，训练之后的推理阶段还需要处理大量数据。Open AI 在训练新模型时使用了超过 25,000 张英伟达 Ampere 100 GPU，持续了 100 天，耗电量 50 GW 时，足以满足一个中型城镇一年的电力需求。根据 Google 的数据，训练占 AI 模型生命周期总耗电量的四成，剩下的六成是推理。功耗的飙升促使科学家思考如何在不牺牲性能的情况下减少内存和计算要求。研究人员尝试了模型剪枝、量化等优化方法。",

It&#39;s no longer a special occasion. For the traveling masses, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/air-travel-in-every-decade-2017-8\">commercial flying</a> has been reduced to the essence of what it is: public transportation.&nbsp;</p><p>Things didn&#39;t used to be this way. We&#39;ve all been regaled with tales of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flying-before-9-11-vintage-photos-2023-11\">Golden Age of air travel</a>: spacious seats, cosseting service, fine wines, and gourmet meals.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the glamour of the Golden Age has not completely vanished. It&#39;s still alive and well in the first-class cabins of the world&#39;s leading airlines like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flew-first-business-and-premium-economy-on-singapore-airlines-mrbeast-2023-3\">Singapore Airlines</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/emirates-airlines-first-class-flight-review-lie-flat-bed-shower-2023-4\">Emirates</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/etihad-41k-airline-ticket-the-residence-first-class-price-cost-tour-abu-dhabi-nyc-2017-2#:~:text=The%20Residence%20is%20a%20full,Etihad%20lounge%20in%20JFK%20airport.\">Etihad</a>.</p><p>And then there&#39;s the inflight experience. Modern first-class cabins offer a greater degree of privacy, comfort, technology, and personalization than the jet set could have ever imagined. With prices that could top $40,000 for a round-trip, these tickets are far from affordable. Then again, neither was first class during the Golden Age of Flight.</p><p>Here&#39;s a closer look at how first-class air travel has changed over the past 70 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id=\"slideshow\"><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">The age of jet-powered scheduled passenger air travel began in 1952 with the De Havilland Comet 1.

I&#39;ll have half a waffle for some carbs and sometimes a protein shake on the side. So it&#39;s a healthy breakfast.</p><p><strong>Sounds like a great breakfast. Is it a chore or a pleasure to eat so much for work?</strong></p><p>It&#39;s definitely a chore, which is my wife&#39;s biggest call-out with me. I really have to force myself to eat and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/burn-fat-build-muscle-by-eating-more-food-lift-weights-2023-11\">keep my calories up</a>. I do like good food and to eat for fun, but I&#39;m more someone who eats to live rather than lives to eat.</p><p><strong>Pretty much every elite athlete I&#39;ve ever spoken to has said the same. Are you disciplined with your diet?</strong></p><p>I&#39;m fairly disciplined. You want to have room for a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-cheat-meals-diet-breaks-flexible-best-for-weight-loss-2021-1\">cheat day</a> once in a while just to be a human being and have a little fun.</p><p>It varies throughout the year, though. My birthday is in March, and after that, it&#39;s the lock-in period leading up to the playoffs and the stretch run when you&#39;re trying to chase championships on the court. So I&#39;m a little more disciplined then.</p><p>But other times, like in summer, there are no rules. You just want to make sure you&#39;re having <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-nutrition-reporters-love-8020-rule-for-healthy-diet-2021-4\">everything in moderation</a> and trying to eat as cleanly as possible.</p><h2 id=\"45956320-e54f-48b7-88ba-9d9628e3c4dd\" data-toc-id=\"45956320-e54f-48b7-88ba-9d9628e3c4dd\">Endless choices for dinner</h2><p><strong>Do you cook dinner in the evening?</strong></p><p>I like cooking but I never cook because I have a beautiful wife who&#39;s an exceptional chef.</p><p><strong>Lucky you.</strong></p><p>I know, for sure.

Our 9-year-old eats whatever&#39;s on her plate. She was eating oysters at 3 years old. She wants to try everything, and eating is the love of her life.</p><p><strong>Do you think a lot about nutrition for your family?</strong></p><p>Yes. That&#39;s why we love working with Plezi.

And for me, getting in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-cold-plunge-at-home-benefits-not-worth-it-review-2024-5\">cold tubs</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/depression-treatment-sauna-temperature-2024-5\">sauna</a>, compression sleeves to make sure you got good blood flow in your legs, different supplements &mdash; they all give me a little boost.</p><p>If I skip one of those, I feel it, and it doesn&#39;t give me the maximum recovery that I need, especially at this stage. So, I commit to my recovery and find fun in the process because that&#39;s more rewarding than what happens on the basketball court.</p><p>It&#39;s time-consuming. It&#39;s not always glamorous, but it does work. The results are proven, and it all allows me to play at a high level, even at this age.</p><p><strong>What does your ideal evening look like?</strong></p><p>A good family dinner, for sure. Yes, I have my recovery routine, but I also make sure I&#39;ve got time to be with the family and watch a movie with the kids. We are very much homebodies and so when you have the entire family at home, it&#39;s always great to enjoy that energy and the laughs.</p><p>I then either watch a good TV show with my wife or put on a game. I watch basketball all the time, so I&#39;m always doing homework and scouting and all that type of stuff. I try to get to bed at a decent time to be ready for the next day.</p><p><strong>Do you have a nighttime wind-down routine?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I wear <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/fitness/normatec-pulse-20-recovery-system-review\">Normatec compression boots</a> when I watch a show in bed, read a book, or talk to my wife.</p><p>After that, I put on an audio track, a sleep sound device meant to trigger the brainwaves and help you get deep sleep. So, those two things get me in the mood to go to bed.</p><p>I go to sleep between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., depending on the night. My wife and I try to go to bed at the same time, but it doesn&#39;t always work.</p><p>I&#39;m a night owl, so I keep her up later than she&#39;d like. For some reason, I&#39;m really productive at night.</p><p><em>Correction: March 27, 2025 &mdash; An earlier version of this story misstated Stephen Curry&#39;s role with Plezi Nutrition.

It was a long process that involved health screenings, psychological evaluations, and verifying my parents&#39; education. After years, we were finally approved to move to the US when I was 11.</p><p>As a refugee, when you think of the US, you always dream of living in New York City, Florida, or California. We landed in Jacksonville, Florida, and I was thrilled. </p><p>Within two weeks, I used my life savings to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/taking-grandchild-to-disney-world-first-time-discoveries-2025-3\">go to Disney World</a>. It was truly a dream come true. So were the more mundane aspects of my new life. I had experienced sharing a bathroom with four other families and being food insecure. I could literally and figuratively have all the bananas I wanted in the US.</p><h2 id=\"b129102d-e52c-4b39-b180-19b558afdde8\" data-toc-id=\"b129102d-e52c-4b39-b180-19b558afdde8\">I started a career in wealth management, but it wasn&#39;t for me</h2><p>When I arrived in the US, I could say, &#34;My name is Orhan,&#34; and that was about it. I started fifth grade and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/learning/how-to-learn-english-esl\">learned English</a> alongside my parents. I was so happy to be in Florida, but I could see how challenging it was for them. My mother has multiple master&#39;s degrees in art, and my dad was an engineer with his own lab in Azerbaijan. In the US, they had to start over, beginning by learning the language. Their advanced education didn&#39;t mean much here.</p><p>We <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reasons-happy-philadelphia-after-los-angeles-2023-9\">moved to Philadelphia</a>, so my dad could attend technical school. I went to an inner-city high school in Philadelphia, which forced me to develop a thick skin. After graduation, I was accepted to Penn State and later got an internship with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>I graduated with multiple job offers in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-millionaire-clients-have-in-common-financial-planner-2024-5\">wealth managemen</a>t. I was only 22, but I had my own office and a lucrative career ahead of me. But I knew that wasn&#39;t my path. I couldn&#39;t see myself doing the office grind for decades. More importantly, I felt a disconnect with my wealthy clients. If I was going to spend my life doing something, I wanted it to be very straightforward, transparent, and honest.</p><h2 id=\"da8ecf8d-e9d9-4d25-9a73-8f903b44d359\" data-toc-id=\"da8ecf8d-e9d9-4d25-9a73-8f903b44d359\">I run a multimillion-dollar business, but drive a used car</h2><p>I spoke with my dad, and we began researching franchise opportunities. Everyone else thought I was nuts, stepping away from my finance career, but my parents believed in me so much that they took out a second mortgage to help me afford my first restaurant. To this day, my dad and I are 50-50 partners.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dd9f0263d72727e197edab?format=jpeg\" height=\"967\" width=\"1355\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Orhan Veli  with his dad\"/><figcaption>Orhan Veli and his dad are still business partners.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Orhan Veli</p></figcaption></figure><p>Those early years were rough. I was 23 and doing nothing but working, earning about $4 an hour. After the financial crisis in 2008, I learned how to operate a business with very slim margins, which ultimately made me a better businessman. Today, I own 11 SaladWorks locations; my restaurants brought in nearly $12 million in 2024.</p><p>I have some financial independence, and I don&#39;t need to worry about money the way I used to. Still, I live modestly. My three kids are in public school, and my wife and I own an average home in our town. We both drive used cars &mdash; a Volkswagen for me and a Lexus for her.</p><h2 id=\"a456641a-d01d-4e86-8675-29dff9ec2169\" data-toc-id=\"a456641a-d01d-4e86-8675-29dff9ec2169\">I&#39;ve used my financial security to help other refugees</h2><p>My wife, Anastasiya, is Ukrainian. When the war broke out, we both wanted to help people. I knew what it was like to have to flee your home country. Although I was a child when it happened, that has never left me.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67dd9f4f69253ccddf99fb55?format=jpeg\" height=\"2666\" width=\"3333\" charset=\"\" alt=\"family posing for photo\"/><figcaption>Orhan Veli and his wife drive used cars.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Orhan Veli</p></figcaption></figure><p>We started raising money to send to Anastasiya&#39;s Ukrainian network. That was impactful, but we wanted to do more, so we decided to sponsor refugees. Sponsors help refugees get settled but also take on the financial responsibility of covering costs like food and housing if the refugee isn&#39;t able to.</p><p>Taking that step was scary. My hands shook every time I signed the paperwork. The first family we sponsored was a husband and wife with toddler twins and an infant. They had been in transit for two months before reaching the US. We&#39;ve also sponsored six extended family members of Anastasiya&#39;s, some of whom she only met once before this.</p><p>I absolutely love our country, and I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of its help. A sponsor I never met allowed me to come here. Taking on financial responsibility for strangers was nerve-racking, but it felt right. I don&#39;t care about the politics of it &mdash; I just know these are real people in a bad situation. I&#39;m in a position to help, so I&#39;m going to do that.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/refugee-now-owns-multimillion-dollar-business-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider verified Park&#39;s past employment and business.</em></p><p>About three years ago, I wasn&#39;t actively job hunting when a recruiter at Apple found me.</p><p>I was happily working as a talent partner at Spotify with no plans to leave.</p><p>Still, I&#39;d made a conscious effort to keep my LinkedIn profile updated &mdash; not for job searching but to position myself for the next step in my career.</p><p>When Apple reached out with an offer to contract for them, it was an opportunity I couldn&#39;t pass up.</p><p>A recruiting manager from Apple messaged me on LinkedIn in October 2021.</p><p>She wrote: &#34;You have an impressive background. I oversee design and creative recruitment for Apple Media Products. I&#39;m eager to see if I might be able to get you on the phone for a few minutes at a convenient time? I look forward to hearing back!&#34;</p><p>I took the role and worked at Apple for seven months &mdash; until they let go of over 100 contractors, including me. It wasn&#39;t the outcome I expected, but was a huge learning experience.</p><p>I worked with some of the best creative leaders in the industry, saw what top companies look for in talent, and learned to think beyond traditional recruiting tools. This experience made me a stronger recruiter and shaped how I help job seekers today.</p><p>I think having my LinkedIn profile optimized for the exact role I wanted was key to the recruiter finding me. Here&#39;s how I set it up and my advice for job seekers.</p><h2 id=\"8a1e5fa5-54c4-4c00-ae19-f5ebd965b3a3\" data-toc-id=\"8a1e5fa5-54c4-4c00-ae19-f5ebd965b3a3\">Craft a compelling summary that tells your story</h2><p>Your LinkedIn summary is one of the first things recruiters look at, so it needs to be clear and impactful. I always recommend keeping it short &mdash; five to six sentences max.</p><p>The key to structuring it well is:</p><ul><li>Start with who you are.</li><li>Highlight the impact you bring to the industry.</li><li>Use relevant keywords from the job descriptions you&#39;re interested in.</li><li>Add a personal touch that reflects who you are outside work.</li></ul><p>For example, in my summary, I included my passion for music and DJing. That detail wasn&#39;t random &mdash; my love of music led me to work at Spotify in April 2021. The detail helped me tell my story and connect it with my industry.</p><p>If you&#39;re applying to Nike, maybe you run marathons. Include that. The goal is to align your personal insights with the role you&#39;re targeting.</p><h2 id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\" data-toc-id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\">Use the right keywords to make your profile searchable</h2><p id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\">When I transitioned from Big Pharma at Allergan and AbbVie to tech in 2021, I didn&#39;t just update my LinkedIn job title &mdash; I made sure my headline clearly showed my expertise in creative and marketing recruitment.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67daa820585f1dff88b28d30?format=jpeg\" height=\"810\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Theresa Park at Allergan&#39;s New York City offices.\"/><figcaption>Theresa Park at Allergan&#39;s New York City offices.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Theresa Park</p></figcaption></figure><p id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\">A LinkedIn headline is that line of text under your name, and one of the first things people on your profile. It should state what you bring to the table and help the right opportunities find you.</p><p id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\">Recruiters search for candidates using specific keywords, so I included terms relevant to my industry, such as &#34;creative recruitment,&#34; &#34;marketing,&#34; and &#34;product design.&#34;</p><p id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\">In my summary, I went beyond listing my job experience. I used keywords relevant to the skills listed in relevant job descriptions like &#34;Boolean search,&#34; &#34;X-ray search,&#34; and &#34;applicant tracking systems.&#34;</p><p id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\">I also highlighted my impact in each role I&#39;d done &mdash; scaling hiring efforts, partnering with leadership, and building recruitment strategies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67daa9e369253ccddf99a92c?format=jpeg\" height=\"830\" width=\"1616\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Theresa Park&#39;s LinkedIn Spotify job description\"/><figcaption>Theresa Park&#39;s LinkedIn Spotify job description.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Theresa Park</p></figcaption></figure><p id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\">Many people simply list their job titles, but that&#39;s not enough. A recruiter might see &#34;Creative Director&#34; in your headline, but they won&#39;t know your specific expertise.</p><p id=\"f77b7a0c-e6d3-464b-9b72-108fcc6c3e88\">When I review 20 profiles, I&#39;ll choose the one that shows impact rather than just listing responsibilities.</p><h2 id=\"91412cc3-4e9b-4a3c-8de4-10b08202b931\" data-toc-id=\"91412cc3-4e9b-4a3c-8de4-10b08202b931\">Keep your profile updated &mdash; even if you&#39;re not job-hunting</h2><p>Even if you&#39;re happy in your current role, don&#39;t neglect your LinkedIn.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t actively looking when Apple reached out, but my profile was up to date. That&#39;s what made it easy for them to find me.</p><p>Make sure to:</p><ul><li>Update your job title and responsibilities with clear impact statements.</li><li>Add results and metrics instead of just listing your tasks.</li><li>Keep your location updated &mdash; recruiters filter by location, and missing or outdated information can mean you don&#39;t show up in searches.</li></ul><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67daa89369253ccddf99a915?format=jpeg\" height=\"748\" width=\"1612\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Theresa Park&#39;s LinkedIn Apple role description\"/><figcaption>Theresa Park&#39;s LinkedIn Apple role description.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Theresa Park</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"822730aa-13d7-4cfd-9ad3-7136ebe8ed45\" data-toc-id=\"822730aa-13d7-4cfd-9ad3-7136ebe8ed45\">Stay active on LinkedIn</h2><p id=\"822730aa-13d7-4cfd-9ad3-7136ebe8ed45\">Engaging on LinkedIn doesn&#39;t mean posting every day, but sharing industry insights and interacting with professionals in your field can help you get noticed.</p><p>As a job seeker, you can advertise yourself through posts about industry trends, challenges you&#39;ve overcome, and lessons you&#39;ve learned. Visibility can lead to opportunities.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/67daaed9b8b41a9673fb0fc1?format=jpeg\" height=\"3452\" width=\"4602\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Theresa Park\"/><figcaption>Theresa Park shares free career advice on her business&#39; social media.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Theresa Park</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"4625df9e-fdb3-472c-8bc3-36d5a3d6f218\" data-toc-id=\"4625df9e-fdb3-472c-8bc3-36d5a3d6f218\">Leverage networking and referrals</h2><p>Back in 2021, when an Apple recruiter found me on LinkedIn, companies were hiring fast, and opportunities were everywhere.</p><p>Now, hiring has slowed down, and companies are much more selective. You can&#39;t just wait for recruiters to come to you.</p><p>When I post a job as a recruiter, I can get 300 résumés. I don&#39;t have time to go through every one and use keywords to filter candidates and may miss some of the best applicants.</p><p>If you know someone at a company you&#39;re interested in, reach out to them or a recruiter. It can make all the difference.</p><p>The recruiter who helped me get my job at Allergan also helped me land my role at Spotify.</p><h2 id=\"aa1366e1-2d74-403e-8e16-1526d2a052b2\" data-toc-id=\"aa1366e1-2d74-403e-8e16-1526d2a052b2\">Use LinkedIn as a tool, but don&#39;t rely on it alone</h2><p id=\"aa1366e1-2d74-403e-8e16-1526d2a052b2\">While LinkedIn is a powerful tool, different industries have different hiring strategies.</p><p id=\"aa1366e1-2d74-403e-8e16-1526d2a052b2\">When I was recruiting designers, I found candidates through portfolio sites like Behance, Squarespace, and Farmer. Instagram was an effective tool for finding social media managers or photographers. And for engineers, I used platforms like GitHub and GitLab.</p><p id=\"aa1366e1-2d74-403e-8e16-1526d2a052b2\">Many companies also post jobs in private Slack communities before making them public. Job seekers should join industry-specific Slack groups and engage in conversations there. It&#39;s an underrated way to network, especially in tech.</p><p id=\"aa1366e1-2d74-403e-8e16-1526d2a052b2\">Being intentional about where and how you present yourself, you can increase your chances of finding the right job.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-job-recruiter-reached-out-linkedin-profile-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

I&#39;m fully aware that one day soon he&#39;ll want to be doing his own thing, so I&#39;m enjoying his company while it lasts.

Eighteen months after its birth, Facebook acquired the company for $1 billion.</p><p>Krieger still remembers, and swears by, advice he received decades ago.</p><p>&#34;Advice that I got when I was 21 and I still think about to this day, is the companies change, the projects change, you know, the economy changes, but the relationships you build in your career will be the relationships that you have over and over again,&#34; he said.</p><p>He said that his experience interning at a startup only cemented the importance of building a strong network and enduring connections.</p><p>&#34;It was full of people who were in their late 30s who had worked together probably three or four times since they were 20, and it really stayed with me,&#34; Krieger said. &#34;Remembering that those relationships build on each other and recur, which means that it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s worth investing in that time.&#34;</p><p>As for young entrepreneurs looking to chart a similar path to success, Krieger suggests worrying less about what seem like distractions. Explorations outside your main project could help you build a vital knowledge base for the future, he added, and not every step &#34;needs to make logical sense.&#34;</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s definitely things that &mdash; side projects I did or explorations I did, where at the time I was like, &#39;Am I wasting my time here?&#39;&#34; Krieger said. &#34;But actually later, I find that it was connected to the next thing I did.&#34;</p><p>Progress can be non-linear, he added, but it&#39;s best to have patience with the process.</p><p>&#34;Just trust that if you&#39;re driving towards a direction, it might take some very strange routes to get there, but as long as you&#39;re learning, I think that that&#39;s fine,&#34; Krieger said.</p><p>For those looking to home in on a specific purpose, Krieger told BI that entrepreneurs should lean on their creativity.</p><p>&#34;The most compelling entrepreneurs possess an almost science fiction-caliber imagination,&#34; Krieger told BI. &#34;Ask yourself, &#39;What future world do I wish existed?&#39; and then consider, &#39;How can I create that with today&#39;s tools?&#39;&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instagrams-cofounder-has-some-advice-for-young-people-2025-3\">Business Insider</a></div>",

We loved the city and didn&#39;t want to leave, but we questioned whether an offer like this would ever come again.</p><p><em>&#34;</em>We&#39;ll move back if we hate it,&#34; we promised ourselves.

Most days, I could barely get out of bed.</p><p>It was about this time when my husband and I began fantasizing about moving back to Chicago. The world was still in the throes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-on-lockdown-coronavirus-italy-2020-3\">COVID lockdown</a>, but what if it weren&#39;t? Where would we be today, we wondered, if we still lived there?</p><p>We romanticized Cubs games, the gritty &#34;El&#34; train, and even our first apartment that blew a fuse every time we plugged in the toaster.

We didn&#39;t sit at home in front of the TV; we were out, moving, doing new things.</p><p>Our son had never experienced that kind of freedom, and depriving him of it weighed on our minds.

The order comes a week after Hanwha Aerospace announced the plan, the country’s biggest-ever secondary share issue, to boost local and overseas production amid growing demand. That filing “lacked information needed for investors to make rational investment decisions,” the Financial Supervisory Service said in a text message to reporters, without elaborating. On March 21, a day after the plan was announced, shares in Hanwha Aerospace posted their worst session since early November 2016, sinking 13%, as analysts raised questions over the intent and necessity for raising capital.

    "description": "Increased defense spending by Japan may persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to soften tariffs on the country, according to Kent Calder of&nbsp;John Hopkins University.&nbsp;(Photo by Konosuke Urata) Investment in U.S. also provides chance for trade-offs, says Johns Hopkins' Calder NAOYA YOSHINO March 27, 2025 21:33 JST TOKYO — As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to impose tariffs on Japan and other&nbsp;trading partners, Tokyo could negotiate a softening of the duties by offering to increase defense spending, Kent Calder, director of the Edwin O. Reischauer Center for East Asian Studies at John Hopkins University, told Nikkei. Edited excerpts from the interview follow. Q: How would you evaluate the meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump? A: I agree with the assessment [in Japan] that it went relatively positively. Relations with Canada and Mexico were not going well because of the 25% tariff issue that was raised. Relations with Europe were not going well because of the Ukraine problem, and relations with China were not going well, because the U.S. wanted to put pressure on China for a variety of reasons. Trump needed stable ties, sort of pillars of support from somewhere, and Japan was the most plausible place. Prime Minister Ishiba was also offering … positive indications on Japanese investment, particularly in the U.S. There is a number of positives. The [liquefied natural gas] issue, where the [Trump] administration’s under the impression, at least, that both Japan and Korea will cooperate — that was another positive. Amid strained relations with other allies, the Trump administration has sought a ‘[pillar] of support’ in its ties with Japan, said Kent Calder.&nbsp;(Photo by Nanami Sato) Q: How should we view Trump’s attitude toward allies, such as Japan and South Korea? A: President Trump, in my understanding, was rather interested in the U.S., Japan, Korea relationship in the summit, and this was one point that he reportedly was interested in. Where is it going? … There are shadows over the political prospects in Korea, whether the Koreans will be able to cooperate. In Korea, there’s a lot of consternation that their political process is crippled now and can’t easily deal with Trump, but it probably will disadvantage Korea, in the end. I think probably the Trump administration as well will be concerned by this. It may mean that there will be even more importance on cooperation with Japan. Q: Do you see the possibility of Trump pressing Japan to increase its defense budget? A: I think absolutely he will. Of course, both sides, Japan and the United States, have strong interest in stability, but in order to maintain stability, it’s important to be prepared for any eventuality. The possibility of instability in the region [Northeast Asia] is not zero and so preparing for that will require more defense spending. President Trump has shown that he’s quite transactional. Of course, it’s difficult to predict exactly what he will do, but I would think that there could be trade-offs between defense spending and things like the level of tariffs or investment in the United States. Q: Is there a possibility that Japan will be exempt from the tariffs, such as the reciprocal tariffs Trump is expected to announce on April 2? A: I would not be surprised if there’s somewhat more favorable treatment for Japan, but not zero. It’s important to note that Japan has gone a long ways in investing in the United States in automobiles. This is a conspicuous case, not only in automobiles, but recently downstream, in things like batteries. I hope that that sort of thing would be appreciated by the White House. I don’t know for certain. But&nbsp;as a general matter, there are still significant trade imbalances between Japan and the United States, and there are things that the United States would hope for that have not been achieved yet. From that point of view, I think [the U.S.] may want to retain some leverage. Q: What do you think will be the impact of dismantling the USAID program on U.S. foreign relations? A: China is stressing the Global South more and more and USAID is directed exactly at the Global South. So it’s not the ideal time to dismantle one of the few agencies that actually engages with the Global South in the United States.",

    "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attends a news&nbsp;conference at the White House in Washington on Feb. 7. © Reuters Trips would underscore growing emphasis on boosting Southeast Asian ties March 27, 2025 20:47 JST TOKYO (Kyodo) — Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is considering visiting the Philippines and Vietnam during Japan’s Golden Week holiday from late April, government sources said Thursday, as Tokyo seeks closer ties with the Southeast Asian nations amid China’s assertiveness in the region. Ishiba is expected to confirm the importance of ensuring a rules-based maritime order, with Beijing’s growing presence in the East and South China seas in mind, the sources said. The envisaged trips would be the first by a Japanese leader since Ishiba’s predecessor, Fumio Kishida, visited the Philippines in November 2023 and Vietnam between April and May in 2022. The Golden Week period runs through early May. The plans highlight Japan’s increased emphasis on strengthening ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, after Ishiba chose Malaysia and Indonesia as his first destinations to visit for bilateral summits after taking office in October. The Philippines is a recipient of official security assistance from Japan that is aimed at strengthening cooperation with like-minded partners through the provision of defense equipment. In January, Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya visited the Philippines, followed by Defense Minister Gen Nakatani in February. Ishiba’s trip would be an occasion to underscore the importance of cooperation bilaterally and trilaterally with their ally, the United States. China’s military buildup in the South China Sea has raised concerns in the region. While some ASEAN nations are much closer to Beijing than to Tokyo, the Philippines and Vietnam have been locked in territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. China continues to send patrol ships to waters around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. The uninhabited islets are administered by Japan but claimed by China.",

    "description": "Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are the dominant players in India's e-commerce market. © Reuters Product certification agency says items did not meet quality control standards March 27, 2025 19:53 JST NEW DELHI (Reuters) — India’s state-run product certification agency said it raided the Delhi warehouses of e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart this month, seizing items that did not meet quality control standards, as it increased its scrutiny of the two firms. Last week, the Bureau of Indian Standards conducted similar searches at the companies’ warehouses in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, saying they stored, sold and exhibited items that did not have a required standards label. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have said they comply with local laws. They did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on the Delhi raids. Both are the dominant players in India’s e-commerce market which, according to estimates by consultancy firm Bain, was worth between $57 billion and $60 billion in 2023, and could top $160 billion in value by 2028. The agency said on Thursday it has seized items including geysers and food mixers worth about 7 million rupees ($81,561) in warehouses operated by an Amazon subsidiary in Delhi. The seized products either lacked the standard quality control mark, or carried fake labels, the agency said. It seized almost $7,000 worth of sports shoes from a Flipkart unit, which were ready for dispatch but did not carry necessary product certification marks. The warehouse seizures are the latest troubles for Amazon and Flipkart in India. An antitrust investigation last September found the companies had violated local competition laws by giving preference to selected sellers on their shopping websites. A 2021 Reuters investigation, based on internal Amazon documents, showed the company had for years given preferential treatment to small groups of sellers, and used them to bypass Indian laws. Amazon denied any wrongdoing.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Gender/Japan-s-same-sex-marriage-ban-3-things-to-know",
    "description": "A gay couple poses&nbsp;with the rainbow flag in a Tokyo photography studio: A&nbsp;series of high court rulings are increasing the pressure on the Japanese government to extend marriage rights to LGBTQ couples. © Reuters Hopes for legalization rise as high courts slam 'unconstitutional' judgments SAYUMI TAKE SAYUMI TAKE March 27, 2025 18:55 JST TOKYO — Pressure is building on the Japanese government to extend marriage rights to LGBTQ couples after the Osaka High Court said Tuesday that failure to do so was unconstitutional, the fifth such ruling by a high court in a series of cases filed against the state by a campaign group. The judgments are expected to provide a tailwind when the legal battle is decided by the Supreme Court. Japanese lawmakers have been reluctant to codify marriage equality but would be obliged to act if the top court deems the current situation unconstitutional. Japan remains the only Group of Seven member yet to take such steps and lags behind Taiwan and Thailand in Asia. Here are three things to know about the fight to legalize same-sex marriage in Japan: How do Japanese courts view the status quo of same-sex couples? Today in Japan, same-sex couples are not granted the privileges that come with marriage as provided by civil law, such as inheritance rights, tax benefits, joint custody of children and access to a spousal visa in the case of a foreign partner. LGBTQ people are fighting to gain such rights under Japan’s Freedom of Marriage for All campaign , which began in 2019. Under the initiative, six lawsuits were filed by same-sex couples with five district courts, suing the state on the grounds that their inability to legally marry their partners obstructs their constitutional right to equality. The Osaka High Court was the 11th and latest to adjudicate cases brought before judges. The verdict on Tuesday recognized that marriage based on the legal system “has become an important option for the pursuit of happiness in life” due to the privileges that come with it. The current provisions disallowing same-sex marriage “seriously undermine the personal dignity of those whose sexual orientation is oriented toward the same sex” and “violate the principle of equality under the law as an unreasonable discrimination based on sexual orientation about the availability of the institution of marriage,” it said. The judgment is in line with those of the Sapporo , Tokyo , Fukuoka and Nagoya high courts, and reverses a ruling by the Osaka District Court, which had been the only one of the five district courts to rule that the lack of legal recognition is constitutional. The campaign group is appealing the rulings to the Supreme Court and expects a decision within a year or two. What is the government’s response? The government argues that the Constitution assumes marriage is between a man and woman. It will be “closely watching” the decision of the Supreme Court, chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters at a daily press conference on Tuesday. The issue of same-sex marriage “is closely related to the family values of each and every individual in the country. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to closely monitor the opinions across all levels of society, the debate in the Diet and the trend of lawsuits,” he said. Sota Kimura, a professor of constitutional law at Tokyo Metropolitan University, noted that the legal momentum is shifting away from the government. “It’s rare for the state to lose consecutively in the first and second trials,” he said. “It would be difficult for it to reverse the case in the Supreme Court.” Courts are increasingly issuing “harsh judgments” of the current situation, largely due to the spread of public understanding, Kimura said. In a 2024 questionnaire by research specialist Ipsos, 67% of Japanese respondents favored the legalization of same-sex marriage while 6% opposed it. The opposition figure was the lowest among the 26 countries surveyed. Nearly 500 local governments covering 90% of the population are now offering a special partnership certificate for same-sex couples, according to Marriage For All Japan, an advocacy group. While such arrangements cannot solve issues like the absence of inheritance rights, they reflect growing support in the nation. What happens next? Legalizing same-sex marriage will require an assortment of issues to be fleshed out, so the Diet and legal community need to start thinking about how to respond should the Supreme Court uphold the high court rulings, according to law professor Kimura. The government might also have to pay reparations to same-sex couples for not responding appropriately despite the string of court rulings. Its inaction so far is “somewhat incomprehensible,” Kimura said, as the state has the duty to taxpayers to act responsibly. “If it were a corporation, shareholders would be pressing as to whether it really thinks it can win.” Same-sex couples could also be granted marriage rights as a result of a political decision. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, known for its conservative stance on gender issues, lost a large number of seats in the lower house general election in October and is struggling to boost its public support . In the same election, the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party gained seats. In December, CDP leader Yoshihiko Noda met with Marriage For All Japan members and promised his party would “do its utmost” to legalize same-sex marriage.",

    "description": "Microsoft&nbsp;CEO Satya Nadella. The U.S. tech giant considers&nbsp;to develop&nbsp;its own generative&nbsp;AI. (Courtesy of Microsoft) Proprietary platform aimed at optimizing model for its business software NAOKI WATANABE March 27, 2025 18:21 JST TOKYO — Microsoft is considering the development of its own high-performance artificial intelligence platform model, CEO Satya Nadella said. While the tech giant has been using the technology of ChatGPT, a generative AI developed by OpenAI of the U.S., having its proprietary platform will make it easier to provide services optimized for its business software. Nadella unveiled the plan during an interview with Nikkei and its group company TV Tokyo. “We will build our own capability to complement all of what we’re doing with OpenAI,” Nadella said. Microsoft will offer such technology through its own business software if it determines that the service can bring added value to customers, he added. Microsoft partnered with OpenAI in 2019, positioning itself as the largest shareholder of the generative AI developer. It has incorporated functions using ChatGPT — including writing and summarizing documents — into its business software such as Word and Excel. The service is provided to businesses and consumers under the name Copilot. Microsoft has developed small platform models in-house. In 2024, it recruited personnel from a leading U.S. AI startup to strengthen its development team. Now the company is expected to aim for developing its own high-performance platform models that can match OpenAI’s cutting-edge products. As for Microsoft’s future investment in generative AI, Nadella said “We will all be governed by real demand,” adding “Where AI goes … all depends on what’s going to happen to global GDP growth.” Microsoft set up its first research center in Japan in 2024 to support the introduction and use of AI in fields of robotics and automobiles. “We want to partner deeply with Japanese companies and open source communities in order to advance state of the art [technology],” Nadella said. There is the risk that AI will spread answers containing errors or be misused for criminal purposes. Nadella pointed to the need to incorporate “a risk based approach” to endure safety of AI use. Having globally normalized standards to govern AI “only reduces, quite frankly, the costs for everybody and improves the efficiency for everybody,” he added. U.S. President Donald Trump, who started his second term in January, is opposing to diversity in American society and moving to raise tariffs, and some corporate leaders in the country are cozying up to him. As for Microsoft, “I think that we should just stay principled on what we always stood for,” Nadella said.",

Skoda Volkswagon India Managing Director Gurpartap Boprai at&nbsp;the launch of Skoda Kushaq in Mumbai in 2021. © AP $340m project is set to produce 120,000 of VW's Skoda cars annually MAI NGUYEN MAI NGUYEN March 27, 2025 17:18 JST HANOI — Vietnamese automobile maker Thanh Cong Group opened a $340 million car plant on Wednesday in northern Quang Ninh province. The plant, the first automobile factory in the province, will assemble 120,000 Czech internal combustion engine Skoda cars per year, the Quang Ninh provincial authority said in a statement on its website. It is the first Skoda Auto factory in Southeast Asia and is expected to churn out its first cars under the model Skoda Kushaq in the second quarter of this year, the statement said. Skoda is a Volkswagen Group brand. The company said Vietnam is its gateway to the Southeast Asian market. At the same time, its geographical proximity to India allows the company to import car parts from India to Vietnam for assembly. The project is expected to attract more nearby investments in engine and battery factories, research and development centers and ports, Quang Ninh provincial authority said in the statement. Thanh Cong, commonly known as TC Group, is the sole manufacturer and distributor of South Korea’s Hyundai cars in Vietnam. The company produces cars using knock-down production, which means importing car parts and assembling finished vehicles. This is the same business model used by the Truong Hai Group, known as Thaco, one of Vietnam’s largest car manufacturers along with VinFast. Thaco works with Japan’s Mazda and South Korea’s Kia. Thanh Cong said it sold 67,168 Hyundai units last year. Thaco sold 90,989 units in the same period, according to data from the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers’ Association . Thanh Cong said the Skoda car factory is its fourth automobile plant in Vietnam, and the company could add electric vehicles to its production in the future. Quang Ninh province borders China and last year received the fourth largest foreign direct investment in Vietnam at $2.9 billion, which was down 10% from a year earlier. Better known to the world with its UNESCO World Heritage Site Ha Long Bay, Quang Ninh has been trying to attract more investments in the industrial sector, a trend across Vietnam — already seen as a manufacturing hub for the region.",

    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House on&nbsp;Feb. 7, 2025, in Washington.&nbsp; © AP Move undermines his call for reciprocity as Japan charges no levy on cars shipped from U.S. Peter Coy March 27, 2025 17:05 JST Peter Coy is a freelance writer specializing in economics and business. He previously wrote for The New York Times opinion section and Bloomberg Businessweek magazine. When U.S. President Donald Trump proclaimed that he wanted reciprocity in tariffs, it seemed to bode well for Japanese automakers. Since Japan charges no tariff at all on cars imported from the U.S., Trump would have to cut U.S. tariffs on Japanese cars to achieve his objective. Trump had said he would announce tariffs on major trading partners on April 2, which he styled “Liberation Day.” But on Wednesday, Trump announced that the U.S. would impose a 25% tariff on cars, trucks and parts imported from any country. He said he’s still planning to announce country-by-country tariffs on Wednesday, so this isn’t over. Most likely Trump will use the two rounds of announcements as a cudgel to get concessions from trading partners. “The point will be to get countries to come in and grovel,” William Reinsch, senior adviser for the economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told me. Reciprocity in trade, which is what Trump says he wants, is a time-honored goal for the U.S., dating back at least to the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. But Trump has an odd way of defining reciprocity. The 25% tariff on car imports is clearly not reciprocal, since it’s higher than many countries charge on car imports from the U.S. As for the countrywide tariffs that Trump is talking about announcing next week, they would presumably be set based on an average of all tariffs that countries impose on the U.S. That turns a scalpel into a dull ax. All sectors of a nation’s economy are treated the same, regardless of whether one is crucial to its culture or security or not. Japanese automakers have been doing for decades what Trump is pressing them to do now, which is to move production to the U.S.&nbsp;They have 24 manufacturing plants in the U.S., not counting two battery manufacturing plants that are coming online this year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. In unit terms, the peak year for Japanese exports of autos to the U.S. was 1986. By contrast, only one vehicle made by the Big Three automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis — made the top 10 in Cars.com’s 2024 American-Made Index.

Also, few American-made vehicles are sold in Japan. Never mind that this mostly reflects consumer preferences. “This is a guy who has one narrative, one metric and one tool,” said Reinsch. The narrative, he added, is that the U.S. is being victimized. The metric is the bilateral trade deficit. And the tool is tariffs. In a Feb. 17 post on X, Trump repeated his long-held view that the value-added taxes used by most of America’s trading partners, including Japan, are a kind of tariff, and thus subject to U.S. reprisals under his definition of reciprocity. That is simply incorrect. A value-added tax, known in some countries as a goods and services tax, is simply a tax on consumption. The tax is the same regardless of whether the product is domestic or foreign, as the International Chamber of Commerce and various economists over the years have explained. Judging from Trump’s X post and a statement from the White House, Trump may also build a few percentage points into tariffs to punish countries for nontariff barriers, such as subsidies for domestic products or excessive regulation of American ones. Nontariff barriers used to be negotiated down through the World Trade Organization, but that group has been left by the wayside. I checked its website one day recently and saw no mention of the Trump-induced chaos in world trade. The top of the home page had four rotating headlines about low-level policy actions, including, “Pakistan formally accepts Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.” Trump believes he’s better off ignoring the WTO than working within its confines. Indeed, issuing ultimatums may work in the short run because trading partners will make concessions to preserve access to the American market. In the longer run, though, it could harm U.S. interests by isolating the country from global trade flows. “The U.S. has overestimated its leverage over the world economy. It accounts for just 13% of world imports,” Richard Baldwin, a professor of international economics at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland, told me. That’s for the future, though. Right now, the best Japanese automakers can do, along with other sellers of goods and services to the United States, is hunker down, because a storm is coming.",

    "description": "The inside story on the Asia tech trends that matter, from Nikkei Asia and the Financial Times March 27, 2025 16:54 JST Hello! This is Lauly, saying hi from the warm weather in Taipei. I can’t believe it’s already been weeks since I returned from Barcelona covering the annual Mobile World Congress, one of the biggest tech exhibitions in a year. As my colleague Annie Cheng Ting-Fang mentioned in her newsletter, we had to take cold showers for three nights at our hotel due to a plumbing issue, walked more than 10,000 steps at the expo and then had to endure subway disruptions for two straight days. And that was not all. I remember I was on my way back from the exhibition to the hotel when I was alerted that C.C. Wei, chairman and CEO of TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, was going to announce a major investment at the White House. My jaw dropped and I texted Annie, and hers dropped as well. I jumped out of the train when it arrived at the station, quickly bought two baguettes (important, as that would be our only food for the night), and ran back to the hotel to start writing. Meanwhile, Annie left a media gathering for a Chinese smartphone maker and hurried back to join me. It had already been such a long day, but thanks to the help of our U.S. colleagues, we were able to cover TSMC’s $100 billion investment announcement . Back in Taiwan, we spent two weeks talking to more than a dozen chip industry people and analysts to try to understand what this bold bet on the U.S. would mean economically and politically. The announcement has become a political saga at home . I was amazed to see politicians from both ends of the spectrum all suddenly becoming linguists, translating and deciphering each word of President Donald Trump when he said the U.S. would still have a “big part” in the chip industry should any conflict break out in the Taiwan Strait. From social networks to political talk shows, TSMC dominated the public discourse for more than a week. And then there was GTC, the annual tech event hosted by Nvidia, the world’s biggest AI chip company. I went to lunch with an executive of an Nvidia supplier a day before he flew to San Francisco for the event. We chatted about TSMC’s investments in the U.S. and Nvidia’s rather volatile stock performance since the emergence of China’s DeepSeek. Like many in the Nvidia AI server supply chain, the executive assured me that the robust demand from cloud service providers persists and that all AI server suppliers are hoping Nvidia will allocate more orders to them. “Lauly, do you know why I need to attend this year’s GTC, why every high-ranking executive from all of the suppliers attend the GTC? It’s like participating in the Matsu Goddess Pilgrimage to get closer to Matsu,” he joked. “If you go and pray, you will get the chance to be blessed.” TSMC’s biggest bet Taiwan, which boasts the second-largest semiconductor industry in the world, has long taken a measure of comfort in its “Silicon Shield,” the concept that its crown jewel chip economy makes it too important for the U.S. not to defend it should China ever invade. But what if the shield is weakened ? That question has been growing over the years, and it took on even more urgency when TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei stood alongside U.S. President Donald Trump and announced plans to invest an additional $100 billion to build more plants in the country, write Nikkei Asia’s Cheng Ting-Fang and Lauly Li . TSMC’s planned investment in the U.S. has ballooned from an initial $12 billion in 2020 to $40 billion in 2022, then to $65 billion in 2024 and finally to $165 billion, more than 10 times its original commitment and its largest overseas investment ever. The Taiwanese contract chipmaking titan is even busier expanding capacity at home, too, but this cannot disguise the fact TSMC and Taiwan more broadly are facing unprecedented levels of pressure from the U.S. and China. “We don’t see the tides turning overnight,” a longtime chip equipment executive told Nikkei Asia. “But in five to 10 years, if U.S. investments fully materialize, they will certainly weaken Taiwan’s role as the world’s top hub for advanced chips. You can’t expect TSMC to replicate these costly facilities in two places.” The DeepSeek effect DeepSeek released an update to its open-source model V3 this week, which ranked highly on independent benchmarks for assessing the model’s performance. Once again, developers praised the small startup for sharing its secret sauce with the AI community for free, write the Financial Times’ Eleanor Olcott , Ryan McMorrow and Zijing Wu . The research lab is shaking up the global AI competition with its powerful and free open-source models. Its success has prompted some soul searching among local rivals that have poured money into model training without the same results. Moonshot, owner of the popular Kimi chatbot, has slashed its marketing budget to focus on model training. Meanwhile, Baichuan laid off its sales team devoted to selling to financial institutions in February, opting to double down on its health care focus. Investors in Zhipu are questioning why the startup is burning through so much cash. Last year, Zhipu, once considered Beijing’s favored large language model startup, made 300 million yuan in sales and 2 billion yuan in losses. It has pinned its hopes on an IPO to sustain its cash-intensive growth, but DeepSeek’s newfound popularity may complicate its path to a listing. The Beijing-based 01.ai stands out from the crowd, having fully embraced what it calls a “DeepSeek Age.” The Kai-Fu Lee-founded startup stopped pretraining LLMs in late 2024 and, in recent weeks, has pivoted to focus on selling tailored AI business solutions using DeepSeek’s models. An AI for an AI In Mandarin, there is a saying similar to “a taste of your own medicine” in English. As scammers around the world use artificial intelligence to ensnare victims, companies like Apate.ai are giving them a dose of this, using AI to counter the scams , Nikkei Asia’s Shaun Turton writes. The Australian startup uses AI bot to create “victims” to soak up scammers’ time and gather insights into their activities. Their Apate Voice product creates AI personas that field calls and engage with scammers whose tactics range from impersonating bank staff and merchants to pushing fraudulent investment schemes. The company also created Apate Text, which does the same thing for text exchanges. The global scam industry has boomed in recent years. A 2024 Global Anti-Scam Alliance report estimated people around the world lost $1.03 trillion in 2023, with only 4% of victims able to fully recover their money. Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia and Myanmar have emerged as hot spots for scam operations, which are also linked to human trafficking. In this environment, Apate.ai sees many opportunities for its product, which can handle tens of thousands of calls and is already being used in Australia, the U.K. and Singapore, with collaborations with governments, cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions. An alternative to ASML Shenzhen SiCarrier Technologies, a Chinese chipmaking tool maker linked to Huawei, has been quietly developing a wide range of equipment to replace tools made by ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research as part of the national effort to unshackle the most painful supply chain choke point created by U.S. export controls, according to this scoop by Nikkei Asia’s Cheng Ting-Fang and Lauly Li . Founded in 2021 and backed by the Shenzhen government, the company has been developing machines involving lithography, chemical vapor deposition, measurement, physical vapor deposition, etching and atomic layer deposition, all fields that are currently dominated by companies from the Netherlands, U.S. and Japan, said multiple people familiar with the situation. SiCarrier has been working closely with Huawei’s growing team of specialists in chip production and chip equipment making, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter said. In a recent post on WeChat, SiCarrier said it will launch a wide range of chipmaking equipment machines during the SEMICON China industry fair this week, including a new atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool named Alishan, after a famous mountain in Taiwan.

    "description": "Brazil's President&nbsp;Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks to reporters in Tokyo on March 27, delivering a sharp critique of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy.&nbsp;(Photo by Tamayo Muto) President defends multilateral trading system and hopes for Mercosur-Japan deal TAMAYO MUTO TAMAYO MUTO March 27, 2025 16:35 JST TOKYO — Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva launched a defense of free trade and multilateralism in Tokyo on Thursday, while threatening to hit back at U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. “Multilateralism is significant,” Lula told reporters a day after he met Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. “The country that once advocated free trade is now advocating protectionism,” he said, referring to the U.S. Nevertheless, Lula said his government is willing to respond in kind and “impose reciprocal tariffs” on the U.S. His remarks came hours after Trump announced a new 25% tariff on foreign-made cars , and days before the White House is expected to unveil a flurry of new tariffs on global trade partners on April 2, dubbed “liberation day.” In their meeting, Lula and Ishiba had emphasized a shared commitment to free trade and laid out the “Strategic and Global Partnership Action Plan Japan-Brazil” for the five years through 2030. The document states that “Japan and Brazil reaffirm their commitment to a free, open, fair, rules-based, nondiscriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system.” On Thursday, Lula said he “cannot understand” what Trump hopes to achieve by imposing the 25% tax on foreign cars, including those from Japan. “It is also a disadvantage for the U.S.,” he said. “It will cause inflation. … President Trump may not yet understand, but time will tell everything.” Trump this month also slapped 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum . Brazil is a key exporter of the metals and Lula said his government would appeal at the World Trade Organization. Some observers have noted that Brazil could also benefit from the U.S.-China trade war, to an extent, becoming an even more competitive supplier of agricultural commodities such as soybeans. After Trump hit China with two rounds of blanket additional 10% tariffs, Beijing responded earlier this month with 10-15% tariffs on a range of U.S. farm goods, including soybeans. Still, Lula said he is “concerned about increased tariffs in any industries” and lamented that a cold trade war between the U.S. and China “should not be allowed.” “Trade should be free,” he said. Brazil’s Lula and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba hold a ceremony at the Akasaka Palace State Guest House in Tokyo on March 26. &nbsp; © Reuters Lula, who will also serve as the rotating president of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) from the latter half of this year, hopes to push that philosophy and tighten trade ties with Asia, with Japan in focus. “I will actively work to conclude an agreement between Mercosur and Japan, just like with the EU,” he said on Thursday. In December, the European Union and Mercosur signed a trade and cooperation pact after 25 years of negotiations. This is the only deal that Mercosur has with a major trading bloc, giving products from Europe an advantage over imports from Japan or the U.S. But Lula said he wants to launch negotiations with Japan during Brazil’s Mercosur presidency, although political considerations within Japan could make for an uphill battle. Likewise, Brazil is pushing Japan to restart beef imports, long frozen due to Tokyo’s cautious stance over safety, including concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). “We will let Japan send a delegation to inspect production sites in Brazil as soon as possible,” Lula said. “We can provide beef with higher quality and cheaper prices than any other country. We hope to find a solution within this year.” After serving two earlier terms as president, from 2003 to the end of 2010, Lula was jailed over corruption allegations that he denies. The convictions were annulled by a court and he was allowed to run again in the 2022 election, when he scored a narrow victory over a man many critics consider the “Trump of the Tropics,” then-incumbent Jair Bolsonaro. This week, Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled that Bolsonaro should stand trial for alleged involvement in an attempted coup plot against Lula — an accusation the former president called “baseless.” “I hope the Supreme Court will work in the way it should,” Lula said when asked about the case. Since returning to lead his divided country in January 2023, the former factory worker turned leftist politician Lula has sought to position Brazil as a key voice of the “Global South” emerging nations, alongside BRICS partners such as China and India. At Thursday’s news conference, Lula insisted that Washington should not be calling the shots on global affairs. “The president of the U.S. is not the boss of the world,” he said. “He should make a decision after exchanging opinions with partner countries.”",

    "description": "Japan's car industry employs 5.5 million people: Domestic employment will be impacted by any&nbsp;shift of production to the U.S.&nbsp;(Photo by Arisa Moriyama) Tokyo and Seoul to pursue exemptions through negotiations Nikkei staff writers March 27, 2025 15:02 JST TOKYO — Japan’s Prime Minister on Thursday sounded the alarm after U.S. President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts . “We need to consider appropriate responses,” Shigeru Ishiba told lawmakers during a parliamentary session. “All options will be on the table.” The move appears to have come as a surprise to Japan, where it is seen as undercutting a bilateral agreement made in September 2019 between Trump and then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. That limited trade deal opened Japan’s market to more American farm goods. It says the two countries will “refrain from taking measures against the spirit of these agreements.” Japanese automakers responded cautiously to the announcement. Toyota, Subaru, Mazda and Honda issued brief statements, saying they were assessing the potential impact. The industry’s muted response reflects its delicate position: Companies need to side with the American public as major business operators in the U.S. while being concerned about the tariffs’ impact on their domestic operations. Tariffs of 2.5% and 25% are already levied on imported cars and trucks. When the new tariffs come into effect on April 3, they will go up to 27.5% and 50%, respectively. The 25% tariffs will also apply to automotive parts such as engines and transmissions and will take effect by May 3 at the latest. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the government intended to negotiate exemptions. Economists said it was not clear how exemptions could be secured, but there are several options. Among the options Japan is likely to consider are voluntary export curbs, a pledge to increase imports for such items as natural gas, grain and meat, and replacing Russian natural gas with that from the U.S., according to economists. In 2023, 8.9% of Japan’s natural gas imports came from Russia compared with 7.2% from the U.S. “Japan is likely to be looking at all these options,” said Koichi Fujishiro, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. South Korea is similarly expected to seek exemptions. Analysts said its negotiating position would be helped by South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Group’s announcement of a $21 billion U.S. investment earlier this week, which was hailed by Trump as a “clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work.” “The U.S. imposed the 25% tariffs on all imported cars by principle,” said Esther Yim, a senior analyst at Samsung Securities. “Washington may negotiate with each country later, and I think the investment can be used as a leverage.” South Korea’s industry ministry promised an emergency response by April, to assist the country’s automakers which are expected to face “considerable difficulties” when the tariffs take effect. Over the years, global carmakers have shifted toward local production to avoid trade friction. As such, 60% of Japanese cars sold in the U.S. are made in the U.S., according to Mitsubishi Research Institute. The share drops to 40% for Korean cars. The share is as high as 70% for European brands. Despite Ishiba insisting all options are on the table, few analysts expect Japan to resort to countervailing measures, at least not at this point. “There would be very little Japan would gain from retaliating against the U.S. tariffs,” Fujishiro said. During a summit with Trump in February, Ishiba made a point of Japan being the biggest investor in the U.S. and a major job creator, and promised to work toward increasing the balance of Japanese investment to $1 trillion from $783.3 billion in 2023. Autos are Japan’s largest export item to the U.S., totaling 6 trillion yen ($40 billion) and accounting for 28% of Japan’s total exports in 2024. The amount is equivalent to 1% of Japan’s nominal gross domestic product. Nomura Research Institute’s Takahide Kiuchi estimates that 25% tariffs would reduce Japanese auto exports to the U.S. by 15% to 20%, lowering Japan’s GDP by 0.2%. If Japanese automakers try to respond to this by shifting production to the U.S., that would reduce domestic employment and hollow out the nation’s economy in the long term. “[Car] exports from Japan are essential to complement Japanese automakers’ local production, and to provide a line up of attractive cars … to meet the various needs by American customers through auto dealers in each state in the U.S.,” said Masanori Katayama, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, during a press conference last week. When the U.S. implements the tariff, Katayama said, “it is expected that there will be significant production adjustment. “The Japanese automobile industry is not just made up of carmakers, but also includes parts suppliers and 5.5 million people.” Katayama insisted that the industry and Japanese government should team up to take action and keep domestic supply chains intact. “We hope that the U.S. government will continue to develop policies and a business environment that provide high levels of predictability and allow Japanese automakers to invest with confidence,” he added. The tariffs are expected to hurt American automakers as well, as they too procure parts and carry out production on a global basis to keep costs down and make their cars competitive in the marketplace. General Motors could fall into an operating loss on an annual basis because of its reliance on factories in Mexico, Nomura analyst Anindya Das said. Toyota could see a 30% decline in operating profit, he added. “The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S.,” said Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, an industry group representing international automakers with operations in the U.S. including Toyota, Honda, Nissan and others.",

    "title": "Taiwan’s new civil defense drill prepares for worst, from nature or China",
    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Taiwan-tensions/Taiwan-s-new-civil-defense-drill-prepares-for-worst-from-nature-or-China",
    "description": "Participants in Taiwan's civil defense drill tend to a \"patient\" in Tainan on March 27. (Photo by Cheng Ting-fang) Diplomats from U.S., Japan, Europe observe first test of 'whole society' resilience CHENG TING-FANG and LAULY LI March 27, 2025 14:25 JST TAINAN, Taiwan — Over 1,500 people gathered in Taiwan’s southern city of Tainan on Thursday to test the ability of civil society — as opposed to the military — to respond to disasters amid deteriorating relations with China. President Lai Ching-te hosted the drill — the first live, civilian-based exercise of its kind under his concept of “whole of society” resilience. Participants ranged from local and central government officials to volunteer firefighters and police officers, as well as about 500 regular civilians, according to a senior Taiwanese government official. The military was not directly involved, apart from providing medical aid and tents for logistical support. The absence of the armed forces was intended to provide a clearer picture of the resilience of local officials and civilians. Ambulance sirens blared as the “injured” were brought to temporary medical centers for treatment, part of preparations for a cyberattack that disrupts hospitals. The scenario simulated a series of complex disasters: a massive explosion at the Port of Anping, followed by a powerful 8.0-magnitude earthquake originating in the Manila Trench, and a devastating tsunami expected to strike southern Taiwan. But the elephant in the room was China, which has stepped up military pressure on the island with its own large-scale drills and incursions, raising fears that it could one day attempt to assert the Communist Party’s territorial claim to the island democracy by force. Both President Lai and Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim attended Thursday’s exercise. “I saw a wife really crying as she reported to the police, I saw a person pretend he broke his bone, and I saw doctors seriously treating the patients,” Lai said. Praising participants’ cooperation, he continued, “I saw massive strength coming from civilians.” It was also a demonstration to the world, as foreign diplomats including Raymond Greene, director of the American Institute in Taiwan — Washington’s de-facto embassy — donned vests as they watched the proceedings. The international observers included representatives from 13 democracies, also including Japan and European countries. Observers from Finland, Israel and other countries known for civil resilience were among them. Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te, center, attends the Tainan exercise. Raymond Greene, the de facto U.S. envoy, looks on behind him.&nbsp;(Photo by Cheng Ting-fang) The civil defense drill came a week after the Lai administration held an “immediate combat readiness” exercise, simulating a scenario in which China unexpectedly pivots from a military exercise into a real attack. Recently released plans for this summer’s annual Han Kuang military exercise also mentioned, for the first time, 2027 as a potential year for a Chinese invasion. Tensions rose further this month after Lai publicly referred to China as a “foreign hostile force” for the first time and warned about increasing threats of Chinese infiltration. This was met with an angry response from Beijing and fresh military drills near Taiwan. Ian Chen Tsung-yen, director of the Institute of Political Science at National Sun Yat-sen University, said the civil exercise is crucial for the island’s defensive capabilities in light of escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait. “China’s harassment via air and sea is getting worse,” Chen told Nikkei Asia. “It is very important to increase the Taiwanese public’s awareness over Beijing’s aggression.” The professor added that “if a military conflict breaks out, followed by disasters, our military won’t have the capacity to conduct rescue missions. It will rely on our civil defense capability.” A middle school doubles as an emergency center.

The committee aims to bolster civilians’ preparedness and training for all types of incidents, from natural disasters to military attacks, and to strengthen the resilience of strategic supplies, critical infrastructure, medical care and other vital areas. Unlike previous drills that were based on scripted settings and planned responses, the exercise on Thursday had no staged plans. Instead, participants were tasked with acting out scenarios and responding on the fly. “We can’t afford to not prepare, due to current geopolitics,” Lai said. “If we prepare well, we can protect our safety. … We need to demonstrate that we are prepared and ready so that we can have peace and stability.”",

    "description": "Consumers in China are reining in spending, dragging down earnings at&nbsp;some consumer goods companies. © Reuters Food, household goods makers looking for overseas growth face price-dumping claims WATARU SUZUKI and KENJI KAWASE March 26, 2025 20:19 JST Updated on March 27, 2025 13:55 JST HONG KONG — China’s top food and household product companies said they would step up efforts to seek growth overseas after weak demand at home dented earnings last year. China Mengniu Dairy, a leader in the country’s dairy product industry, reported a 10% decline in revenue to 88.67 billion yuan ($12.21 billion) for 2024, with a 98% drop in net profit to 104.50 million yuan. On Thursday, the day after the numbers came out, CEO Gao Fei told reporters that the double-digit shrinkage of the top line was mainly due to “industrywide” price declines, amid what management described as “lower-than-expected consumer demand.” The company’s chief financial officer, Zhang Ping, stressed that the problem “was not about quantity but about price.” Mengniu’s main liquid milk business was hit especially hard, as revenue from this segment, which makes up over 80% of total sales, fell by 11% on the year. Cost cuts partially softened the blows, but profit was nearly wiped out by impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets, including Bellamy’s, an Australian subsidiary acquired in 2019. Still, despite the risks of managing international businesses, Gao vowed to “accelerate the expansion abroad,” mainly eyeing Southeast Asia, as the company’s Aice ice cream as become a leading brand in Indonesia and the Philippines.

He blamed&nbsp;price declines as&nbsp;the main cause of a double-digit fall in&nbsp;last year’s revenue.&nbsp;(Photo by Kenji Kawase) Hengan International Group, a major producer of tissues and disposable diapers, reported on Tuesday that net profit fell 18% from a year ago to 2.3 billion yuan in 2024. “We’ll be looking for more opportunities overseas,” Hengan International Group CEO Hui Ching Lau told reporters on Tuesday. Lau said the company will be “promoting the development of overseas business as an important strategy this year more than before,” although he did not specify targets. Lau noted that “competition is extremely fierce” in China and the company is suffering the impact of a price war between e-commerce operators such as Pinduoduo and Douyin. For example, Hengan’s 24-box tissue pack is sold for just 33 yuan on Pinduoduo compared to 62 yuan on Taobao, which is owned by Alibaba Group. Higher raw material prices and increased spending on promotions also eroded Hengan’s profit margin. “If everyone were to operate at a loss continuously, a company wouldn’t be able to keep going,” said Lau, projecting that such a trend would persist until the market undergoes consolidation. He added that China’s tissue market remains extremely fragmented, pointing to the “several hundred” small factories operating in just the one city of Baoding, in northeastern Hebei province. Meanwhile, bottled water maker Nongfu Spring’s annual revenue and net profit grew less than 1%, dragged down by a slump in the second half of the year. In particular, its packaged water business took a sharp hit, falling 21% from a year ago to 15.95 billion yuan. The company blamed the decline on “a surge of online attacks and malicious defamation” since February last year after Chinese nationalists hurled accusations at its red-capped water bottles for resembling the Japanese flag when held up against a piece of white paper. The company later introduced a new bottle with a green cap.

Results at both Hengan and Nongfu missed analyst estimates published on FactSet. China faces deflationary pressures on the back of a property market downturn and as consumers reined in spending due to weak job prospects. The consumer price index for the first two months of 2025 slipped 0.1% annually, bogged down by declines in food and consumer goods prices. Given weak demand at home, some companies are expanding abroad but such moves have led to accusations by other countries, including the U.S., that China was dumping excess capacity overseas. Premier Li Qiang has acknowledged the issue, saying in a government work report released earlier this month that China will “take comprehensive steps to address rat race competition.” WH Group Chairman Wan Long, right,&nbsp;told reporters in Hong Kong on Tuesday that the U.S.-China tariff war will “not have a significant impact” on the meat processing company.&nbsp;(Photo by Wataru Suzuki) Other companies that have a presence overseas fared better. The world’s largest pork producer WH Group, said stronger earnings in Europe and the U.S. helped offset lower packaged meat and pork sales in China. WH Group reported an 8% decline in packaged meat sales in China, which it attributed to a “lack of effective demand from the market.” Sales in Europe, however, grew by 25%, thanks to its acquisition of Spanish meat producer Argal which was completed in March 2024. In January, WH Group listed its U.S. meat processing subsidiary Smithfield on the Nasdaq exchange. Chairman and CEO Wan Long said the company would “continue to accelerate expansion in the U.S. and Europe” through acquisitions and would not be as active in China. When asked about the impact of the intensifying trade war between the U.S. and China, Wan said the additional tariffs would “not have a significant impact” on its business due to resilient demand in the U.S. and the group’s global footprint. WH Group said it would adjust its product mix to minimize the impact. On a positive note, higher spending for collectible toys propelled Pop Mart’s net profit by 189% annually to 3.1 billion yuan. Known for its animated characters made of vinyl, the group’s revenue in mainland China grew 52%, while overseas sales jumped nearly fivefold. Pop Mart CEO Wang Ning said during an analyst meeting on Wednesday that the company aims to increase its total revenue by 50% in 2025. Part of the strategy is to raise the ratio of its overseas revenue from 39% in 2024 to over 50%. He added that domestic performance in the first quarter has “exceeded our expectations,” thanks to hugely popular figurines from blockbuster movie “Nezha 2.” The company’s Hong Kong-listed shares climbed over 11% after his remarks.",

    "description": "North Korea is also supporting Russia's war in Ukraine by shipping weapons. © KCNA via Kyodo Amid concerns of Russian tech transfers, Kim Jong Un observes attack drone tests March 27, 2025 13:32 JST SEOUL (AP) — North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February in continued support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, South Korea’s military said Thursday in its latest assessment. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea has also been sending more missiles, artillery equipment and ammunition to help Russia and that North Korea could increase its weapons supplies further depending on the war situation. Russia and Ukraine recently agreed on a limited ceasefire, though both sides have accused each other of violations. The military equipment North Korea has sent to Russia includes a “considerable amount” of short-range ballistic missiles, 170-millimeter self-propelled howitzers and around 220 units of 240-millimeter multiple rocket launchers. North Korea has sent approximately 11,000 military personnel to fight in the war against Ukraine in its first involvement in a large-scale conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War, and the Joint Chiefs assessed that around 4,000 of them have been killed or injured. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service previously attributed the high North Korean casualties to the troops’ likely struggles in adapting to drones and other elements of modern warfare. North Korean troops are further disadvantaged by the crude tactics of their Russian commanders, who have sent them into assault campaigns without providing rear-fire support, the spy agency told lawmakers in January. Still, Ukrainian military and intelligence officials have assessed that the North Koreans are gaining crucial battlefield experience and have been key to Russia’s strategy of overwhelming Ukraine by throwing large numbers of soldiers into the battle for Kursk. The South Korean military report came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last week in Pyongyang expressed his unwavering support for Russia’s war in Ukraine during a meeting with Sergei Shoigu, a top Russian security official. State media reports said Kim and Shoigu reaffirmed their commitment to uphold a major mutual defense treaty agreed upon last year. Kim’s military support of Russia has raised concerns that he may receive Russian technology transfers in return, further strengthening the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military. Experts say drones are among the potential areas where North Korea might seek to acquire Russian technology and know-how. North Korean state media said Thursday that Kim observed tests of newly developed reconnaissance and attack drones this week and called for their increased production. Kim in recent months has been emphasizing the development of drones, and the tests were the latest display of his country’s growing military capabilities. Photos released by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency show Kim observing what appears to be a large reconnaissance drone roughly resembling Boeing’s E-7 Wedgetail airborne warning and control aircraft. Other images show exploding drones crashing into military vehicles used as targets. The agency said the test demonstrated the reconnaissance drone’s ability to track multiple targets and monitor troop movements on land and at sea, potentially enhancing North Korea’s intelligence-gathering operations and ability to neutralize enemy threats. The report said the new exploding drones are designed for various attack missions and feature unspecified artificial intelligence capabilities. Kim expressed satisfaction with the drones’ performance and approved plans to expand production, emphasizing that drones and AI should be “top” priorities in efforts to advance his armed forces and adapt them to modern warfare, KCNA said. The agency said the tests took place as Kim visited a drone technology complex and an electronic warfare research group on Tuesday and Wednesday. Kim in August and November also inspected demonstrations of drones that explode on impact. When asked about the new reconnaissance drone, which North Korean state media unveiled for the first time, Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the North likely modified an existing aircraft to create an early-warning drone and may have used certain components from Russia. He said North Korea was possibly exaggerating the drone’s capabilities. “As you can see, it looks quite cumbersome, and we assess that it’s likely vulnerable to interception,” Lee said during a briefing, without elaborating further on the assessment.",

    "description": "Following Trump's Wednesday&nbsp;announcement on auto tariffs, Japan automakers underperformed the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average and the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index on Thursday, which were both down around 1%. (Nikkei montage/Source photo by Kaisuke Ohta) The day's drop is just the beginning, if Trump keeps policy: Jefferies LISA KIM LISA KIM and JAEWON KIM March 27, 2025 12:50 JST TOKYO/SEOUL — Shares of Japanese and South Korean automakers slid Thursday morning after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all cars shipped to that country in his latest trade salvo. Smaller Japanese automakers dependent on the U.S. for sales but&nbsp;behind in onshore production were hit hard. Subaru dropped 6.3%, and Mazda Motor lost 5.8%. Toyota, the country’s largest automobile manufacturer, was off 3.3%, and Honda was down around 2%. Automakers underperformed the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average and the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index, which were both down around 1%. The yen weakened to the mid-150 level after the dollar strengthened on the tariff announcement. “Markets will observe the sustainability of these tariffs, or whether Trump, often referred to as a deal maker, will roll back them when offered incentives,” said Shrikant Kale, senior quantitative strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong. “In the absence of that, This is just the beginning of a multi-month story.” Subaru, Mazda Motor&nbsp;and Mitsubishi Motors are among Japanese manufacturers with a market capitalization of more than $2 billion that have a greater U.S. sales exposure than U.S. production, according to a report Kale published in February. Subaru, for instance, generates around 73% of its sales in the U.S. and manufactures 29% of its products there, according to the report. While more time is needed to see how the auto tariffs play out, Kale said his analysis from earlier in the year that assumed 10% levies and a 30% absorption rate showed auto earnings would drop by 3.4%. The auto tariffs will take effect on April 3 , a day after Trump is expected to impose reciprocal tariffs , much of which is still unknown. Goldman Sachs, whose baseline scenario called a 25 percentage point increase in tariffs on all car imports, said the levies would have a “significant” impact on Japanese autos and auto parts makers. Autos account for more than 30% of Japan’s exports to the U.S. and 7% of total exports, according to a report economists led by Tomohiro Ota wrote Wednesday. The 25% tariffs on autos would also drag Japan’s gross domestic product by more than 0.1 percentage points, the report said. In the near term, “the decline in auto exports could be larger,” the report said, “due to factors such as consumers postponing purchases in anticipation of an early end to the tariff increase and a pullback from front-loaded demand ahead of the tariff.” Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea’s largest carmaker Hyundai Motor and its sister firm Kia Motors slid 4% and 3%, respectively, on Thursday morning. The firms together ship around 1 million autos from South Korea to the U.S. U.S. auto tariffs are a setback for Hyundai Motor Group, whose executive chairman Chung Eui-sun stood beside Trump just two days ago as the president&nbsp;referred to the firm’s $21 billion investment in the U.S. as “a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work.” The South Korean automaker on Thursday held an opening ceremony for its new plant in Georgia. The vehicle assembly and battery plant has the capacity to initially produce 300,000 electric and hybrid vehicles per year for its Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and Hyundai’s luxury brand Genesis, the company said. “With the rich history of craftsmanship and manufacturing in this community, together with the talented workforce at Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, we are building the future of mobility with America, in America,” Chung said at the ceremony.",

    "description": "A mobile crane carries a container to stack it at Thar Dry Port in Sanand in the western state of Gujarat, India. © Reuters Delhi speeds up talks with U.S., while reaching out to EU, U.K. and New Zealand KIRAN SHARMA KIRAN SHARMA March 27, 2025 12:40 JST NEW DELHI — India has stepped up efforts to strike trade deals with other countries in an apparent bid to minimize the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s looming tariffs, even as New Delhi and Washington are finalizing the framework for a “mutually beneficial” bilateral trade pact. Ahead of Trump’s April 2 deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on countries, Brendan Lynch, assistant U.S. Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, and other American officials are in India on a five-day visit through Saturday for meetings with Indian counterparts as part of ongoing trade talks. “This visit reflects the United States’ continued commitment to advancing a productive and balanced trade relationship with India,” a U.S. embassy statement said earlier this week. While the specific agenda of the talks has not been shared, officials in New Delhi said that the shape and scope of the proposed bilateral trade agreement (BTA) would be confirmed by both sides. “Contours of the BTA will be finalized,” one of them said on condition of anonymity. Randhir Jaiswal, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesperson, said on Friday that the two sides “are actively working to build a framework for the BTA, which would aim to expand trade, enhance market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration.” The two sides have announced that they plan to negotiate the “first tranche,” or phase one, of the BTA by the fall. While officials have not disclosed what the first phase would entail, local media reported that it is expected to cover issues concerning goods trading, while the second tranche, which is likely to be the final one, may involve topics like technology transfer. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February visited Washington where he and Trump resolved to deepen ties and expand trade to $500 billion by 2030, from around $200 billion now. U.S. President Donald&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;and Indian Prime Minister Narendra&nbsp;Modi&nbsp;shake hands as they attend a joint press conference at the White House in Washington on&nbsp;Feb. 13. &nbsp; © Reuters According to India’s Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal, the two sides are negotiating a “multi-sectoral” agreement. Brokerage Nomura sees the ongoing BTA negotiations as an encouraging sign for India. “It signals that, while India is in the direct line of fire on U.S. reciprocal tariffs, the BTA could reduce the impact of any such tariffs on India,” it said in a recent note. By the Modi-Trump meeting, it added, India had already cut duties in sectors like textiles, motorcycles and bourbon whiskey. “India has also avoided any tit-for-tat response to provocations from Mr. Trump,” the brokerage said. While India lowered import duties on certain items as concessions to the Trump administration, New Delhi more broadly “appears to have redoubled efforts to strike trade deals” with other countries, “most likely in an effort to strengthen its export base beyond the U.S.,” Capital Economics said in a note on March 20. India and the European Union announced late February they were aiming to conclude a trade agreement by the end of this year. Days before, New Delhi resumed trade talks with London after they were paused in May last year. India and New Zealand in mid-March also announced the resumption of trade talks that fell apart in 2015. However, India must exercise caution while negotiating the BTA with the U.S., said Ajay Srivastava, founder of New Delhi-based Global Trade Research Initiative think tank. The deal faces “congressional scrutiny, possible amendments, delays, or outright rejection,” without the application of a special power known as the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), Srivastava said. This power must be given by Congress to the president and will help speed up and simplify trade negotiations with other countries. However, the TPA has not been renewed since it lapsed in 2021. In addition, after signing a trade agreement, the U.S. often uses its own certification or review process to judge if the partner country has been implementing all aspects of the deal, “sometimes using this to pressure for more changes or new terms,” said Srivastava. The one-sided certification and absence of TPA will “give the U.S. room to change the deal later or ask for more than what was originally agreed,” he added. World Trade Organization data from 2023 showed that India’s simple average tariff rate was 17%, compared with 3.3% for the U.S. Trump has repeatedly singled out India for its high tariff rates even though he enjoys warm personal rapport with Modi. The U.S. trade deficit with India in goods was $45.7 billion in 2024, a 5.4% increase over the previous year, an issue that the Trump administration would be looking to address in trade negotiations with New Delhi.",

    "title": "How Alaskan energy can power the U.S.-Japan relationship",
    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/How-Alaskan-energy-can-power-the-U.S.-Japan-relationship",
    "description": "A U.S.-Japan partnership to deliver affordable energy to Japan and our other friends in the Pacific should be a no-brainer. © Reuters Partnership can secure reliable, stable and affordable energy for generations to come March 27, 2025 12:05 JST Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, is governor of Alaska. At the U.S.-Japan summit on Feb. 7, President Donald Trump noted that “Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas in record numbers,” hinting at “a joint venture of some type between Japan and us having to do with Alaskan oil and gas.” This is a proposal both the U.S. and Japan should rally behind. Japan is one of America’s closest and most important allies, and Alaska is a major reason why. Natural gas from Alaska’s Cook Inlet played a crucial role in Japan’s postwar recovery and economic rise. Indeed, Tokyo’s partnership with the city of Juneau helped transform Japan into a manufacturing and technological powerhouse. Meanwhile, Japan’s dynamism, innovation and industrial output have enriched the American people and cemented Tokyo as a critical Western ally. At the White House summit, President Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba did not solidify a deal to expand Japanese access to Alaskan energy. But with a U.S. administration that prioritizes energy production and security as well as economic growth — with threats to freedom and prosperity multiplying around the globe — the time is right to take the historically vital Alaska-Japan relationship to a new level. The case in point is the Alaska Gasline, an 800-mile pipeline that will deliver LNG from Alaska’s energy-rich North Slope to global markets, including Japan. The North Slope holds 35 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas, with another 200 trillion in potential deposits. Pipeline access to these deposits would offer Japan a reliable, affordable and strategically sensible power source while strengthening American energy security and the U.S.-Japan relationship. America learned early in its history that economic ties have a huge impact on a nation’s strategic prospects. Henry Clay saw U.S. dependence on goods from the British Empire as a hindrance to our independence — and he was right. As Europe’s struggle to wean itself off Russian energy demonstrates, maintaining reliable and stable energy partnerships is more important than ever. Alaska&nbsp;Gov.&nbsp;Mike Dunleavy speaks&nbsp;in Houston, Texas, on March 14, 2025.&nbsp; &nbsp; © Reuters Currently, Japan — the world’s second largest net energy importer — relies largely on Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates for oil. While these are credible energy partners, they neither share Japan’s moral and strategic interests nor its commitment to security and prosperity in the Pacific. Alaska, on the other hand, shares these core values. A U.S.-Japan partnership to deliver affordable energy to Japan and our other friends in the Pacific should be a no-brainer. It would ensure that the free world is fueling the free world. Alaska sits at the crossroads between Asia and North America, and U.S. companies lead the world in clean and efficient energy extraction. We are uniquely positioned to supply Japan and other Indo-Pacific partners with natural gas and clean hydrogen for decades to come. Japan, for its part, can use its unique expertise in the LNG sector to help distribute American energy to the rest of the Indo-Pacific. Japanese companies are the largest LNG plant builders, the largest gas turbine providers, and have the largest LNG shipping capacity in the region. Japan’s world-class carbon-capture technology will also be critical to assuring the carbon neutrality of this project. As America seeks to rebuild manufacturing capacity to compete with China, we will need to invest in strong, reliable allies like Japan. A new LNG pipeline project would help Tokyo secure this mutually beneficial investment. For maximum benefit, the Trump and Ishiba administrations should build on their productive engagement and ensure this project gets started soon. Japan and America align on the values of representative government, trade, security, and a world order that supports prosperity and freedom. We have worked together for decades to build a better future. Let us build on this tradition by securing reliable, stable and affordable energy for the next generations.",

    "description": "As scammers use AI to ensnare victims, companies like Aparate.ai are using the technology to counter scams. Apate.ai bots keep swindlers tied up while eliciting information SHAUN TURTON March 27, 2025 10:13 JST SYDNEY — A man calling himself Dayton phones saying he’s from Amazon. He informs the person on the line there has been suspicious activity on his account: someone paid $999.98 for a MacBook Pro to be delivered to San Diego, California. “You for real, mate?” comes the response. “I’m in Sydney, not bloody California. I mean, no, I definitely didn’t buy anything like that. Are you serious?” “Dayton” is not from Amazon, but a scammer in a global illicit industry estimated to have stolen more than $1 trillion from people around the world, according to one study. In this attempt, however, Dayton is the one being tricked. His Australian-accented intended victim — whom he chats with for seven minutes — is not a real person, but one of the AI bots created by Australian company Apate.ai. As scammers turn to AI to supercharge their swindles, the tech startup is wielding AI in the global fightback against the illicit industry, creating “victims” to soak up scammers’ time and gather insights into their activities. Their Apate Voice product creates AI personas that field calls, engaging with scammers whose tactics range from impersonating bank staff and merchants to pushing fraudulent investment schemes. The company also created Apate Text, which does the same thing for text exchanges. For the voice bots, the company’s fake victims vary in age, accent and the languages they use. Their dispositions can shift from wary and confused to agreeable and amazed to bored and distracted. Their goal is to keep the scammer tied up while gathering information on the type of scam and any details, like bank accounts. In another call, a scammer impersonates a representative from Australia’s National Broadband Network and at one point asks, “Do you know where your router is?” The bot appears to fumble about. “Sorry, hang on a minute, yeah, umm, it’s near, umm, the TV,” it says, conceding it’s not great with technology. Apate.ai currently has 10 employees, four members of the founding team and six developers. Its founder, Dali Kaafar, is a professor at Macquarie University, where he’s executive of the institution’s cybersecurity hub. The idea’s genesis came when Kaafar was interrupted by a scam call during a family picnic. The company’s chief commercial officer, Brad Joffe, said Apate.ai is “creating the perfect victim.” The power of AI learning means their bots continually get better at leading on scammers, whose frustration is a keenly monitored metric. “We might be one of the only startups in the world that celebrates when people swear using our product,” he said. The global scam industry has boomed in recent years. A 2024 Global Anti-Scam Alliance&nbsp;report estimated people around the world lost $1.03 trillion in 2023, with only 4% of victims able to fully recover their money. Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia and Myanmar have emerged as hotspots for scam operations, which are also linked to human trafficking. Meanwhile, banks, utilities and financial payment providers are responding to pressure to improve protections for customers. In the U.K., telecom company O2 found that 1&nbsp;in 5&nbsp;people report a scam call every week, with the company also turning to an AI bot solution. Unveiled last year, the AI “granny” named “dAIsy” wastes scammers time with rambling answers, including references to its cat “Fluffy.” In this environment, Apate.ai sees many opportunities for its product, which can handle tens of thousands of calls and is already being used in Australia, the U.K. and Singapore with collaborations with governments, cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions. Between December 2020 and September last year, Australian telecommunication providers blocked more than 2.2 billion scam calls and 788 million scam text messages. Apate.ai is collaborating with Australia’s Commonwealth Bank and is currently in trial with one telco in the same country, which diverts its blocked scam calls to the company’s bots. Joffe said the system could detect within the first five to 10 seconds whether a call was legitimate or not. Those wrongly screened are forwarded back to the telco. From the scam calls, the company generates data that is fed back to a dashboard as part of its Apate Insights product, showing things like types of scams and what companies are being impersonated — information which can then be used to generate real-time warnings. It can also flag any personally identifiable information disclosed by the scammer — like bank account details or websites — and create alerts. Joffe warned scams were getting increasingly sophisticated, noting AI-powered technology could now clone voices with only 10 seconds of material, leading to swindles like the “Hey Mum” scam, where the fraudsters pretend to be children in trouble that need money quickly. In such an AI-driven cat-and-mouse game, it made sense to develop a strong defense. “If they’re using it as a sword, we need it as a shield,” he said.",

    "description": "Indonesian bank notes. The rupiah has weakened by about 3% this year against the U.S. dollar, making it among the poorest performing emerging market currencies. Investors are skeptical about President Prabowo Subianto's economic agenda © Reuters Exporters benefit while importers and consumers contend with higher prices ISMI DAMAYANTI and NANA SHIBATA March 27, 2025 09:24 JST JAKARTA — The Indonesian rupiah fell on Tuesday to its lowest level against the U.S dollar since the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis, exceeding its depreciation during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has weakened 3% this year, making it one of the poorest performing emerging market currencies. Indonesia’s economy is deeply reliant on exchange rate stability, from corporate transactions to the importing of industrial supplies, and Bank Indonesia, the central bank, has intervened to prevent further weakening. While exporters of key commodities like palm oil are reaping windfall gains from the weakening rupiah, the other side of the coin is more troubling. Importers and consumers will have to contend with rising costs that threaten to erode purchasing power and strain the broader economy. Here are five things to know about the rupiah’s depreciation and what it could mean for Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. Who gains from a weakened rupiah? Traders and exporters of commodities such as coal, palm oil, fisheries and other raw materials who earn revenue in foreign currencies are benefiting from the rupiah’s depreciation. Coal miners are particularly enjoying a windfall, as most of their production costs are denominated in rupiah. “We will remain cautious as expanding into new global markets for coal remains a challenge,” said Gita Mahyarani, acting executive director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association (ACMI). Local coal miner Indo Tambangraya Megah is seeing a positive impact from the weakened rupiah, as the majority of its revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. “We do have some expenses in U.S. dollars, but they make up a much smaller portion compared to our overall earnings,” said Yulius Kurniawan Gozali, the company’s Director of Risk, Strategy, and Communication. Palm oil producers are also seeing gains from the stronger U.S. dollar, although they cautioned that the benefits may be short lived. “If the U.S. dollar remains strong in the long term, we’ll eventually feel the pressure on the cost side, especially for imported fertilizers,” said Eddy Martono, chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association. Benny Soetrisno, chairman of the Indonesian Exporters Association, said the depreciating rupiah was a blessing for exporting companies. “For those whose production costs are in rupiah, they will get additional benefit,” he said. Who suffers from the rupiah’s depreciation? Importers and businesses that depend on imported goods and raw materials are feeling the pressure from the weakening currency. This particularly includes those in the manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors. According to Soetrisno of the exporters association, even manufacturers with export products remain vulnerable: “Around 45% of players in Indonesia’s manufacturing sector still rely on imported raw materials.” Indonesian pharmaceutical giant Kalbe Farma said it is facing mounting pressure from rising import costs and the limited availability of locally sourced raw materials. “About 60% to 70% of our imports are transacted in U.S. dollars,” said Hari Nugroho, the company’s head of external and stakeholder relations. To mitigate currency risks, Kalbe Farma has benefited from a previous joint venture with a Chinese partner, which allows for payments in yuan for materials sourced from China. “In addition, the company has also set aside U.S. dollar reserves to cushion against further exchange rate volatility,” he said. Companies with U.S. dollar liabilities are also facing rising loan repayment costs, which could squeeze profitability. Among the most high-profile businesses are a state-owned construction company, Hutama Karya, which holds $600 million in global bonds that mature in 2030. What is the likely consumer fallout? Consumers are already starting to feel the pinch, with rising prices of goods affecting household spending and economic sentiment. “Imported goods and services are becoming more expensive, potentially driving up inflation and reducing purchasing power,” said Hosianna Situmorang, a Bank Danamon economist. For Firna Ramdani, a Jakarta-based officer worker who cares for a diabetic sibling, the rupiah’s decline is a growing concern: “We might soon be told by the pharmacist that the price of my brother’s medication is going up because the medicine is imported.” Last month, the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) reported that prices fell 0.09% year on year, the first annual deflation since 2000. But inflation is expected to return this month due to the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Meanwhile the economic downturn has already resulted in tens of thousands of layoffs in several manufacturing sectors. How have the authorities reacted? Coordinating Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto remains confident that the rupiah’s depreciation is temporary, citing strong domestic fundamentals. “Our economy is fundamentally strong, the market has rebounded and there are positive sentiments from the Bank Rakyat Indonesia and Bank Mandiri shareholders meetings,” he said on Wednesday, referring to two of the largest publicly-listed, state-owned lenders. Hartarto noted that external factors continue to pose challenges to stabilizing the rupiah. “Bank Indonesia will take measures to maintain [rupiah] stability,” he said. Bank Indonesia’s head of macroprudential policy, Solikin Juhro, said on Wednesday that the current situation is very different from the 1997-1998 financial crisis. “We’ve learned a lot since then. Back in 1998, we couldn’t detect the vulnerabilities in time,” he told a press briefing. He said that recent robust performances at most corporations mean financial capacity remains strong: “This helps keep household risks in check and incomes remain within a relatively safe zone.” How and when might the situation turn around? Situmorang of Bank Danamon said that in the short term, BI’s intervention could help stabilize the currency. “But the large amount of DNDF maturities will keep rupiah under pressure,” she said, referring to BI’s intervention measures in the derivative foreign exchange market. Situmorang said a potential rebound could occur in early April after the upcoming end-of-Ramadan holiday, once capital inflows resume, “particularly if global uncertainty eases and investor sentiment improves.” But she projected that the rupiah will continue to remain weaker than 16,300 if the U.S. dollar remains strong and external risks persist.

    "title": "Books: Huawei’s origin story probed, but no smoking gun",
    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Books/Books-Huawei-s-origin-story-probed-but-no-smoking-gun",
    "description": "The most revealing insight of \"House of Huawei\" is how the company has merged the organizing principles of its Silicon Valley peers and the Chinese Communist Party and used both to achieve global success.&nbsp; © Getty Images Portrait of Chinese telecoms group distinguishes it from the Chinese state Ross O'Brien ROSS O'BRIEN March 27, 2025 08:00 JST Earlier this month, reports emerged that the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies had bought 2 million semiconductors from Taiwan’s Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. through shell companies, circumventing U.S. restrictions aimed at blocking Chinese access to advanced chips. That Huawei needs to jump through hoops to buy its chips speaks as much to the globally interconnected nature of telecoms equipment manufacturing as to the fact that it is struggling after nearly a decade-long technology cold war, in which the U.S. sees Huawei as its primary adversary. In many ways, though, it does not seem that the company, or China’s technology markets, are struggling at all: Huawei shocked the world recently with the release of the Ascend 910C, an advanced AI accelerator chip that the company plans to mass-produce this year. Huawei was established in Shenzhen, southern China, in 1987 as a contract manufacturer of telephone switches, and swiftly built a vast and integrated portfolio of telecoms network solutions, including latest-generation 5G mobile networks, in which it is the world’s largest holder of patents. By 2012 Huawei had become the world’s largest telecoms gear maker, overtaking Sweden’s Ericsson, its chief rival, and reporting 869 revenues of 869 billion yuan ($110.2 billion) in 2024. The company owes much of its success to the same ingredients found in many other high-performing high-technology startups: a business strategy focused on building world-class foundational technologies, and the leadership of a relentlessly hardworking (if somewhat obsessive) entrepreneur. But Huawei was also different from Western tech companies: a new and uniquely Chinese company, driven by a nation-building sense of urgency and patriotic self-sacrifice. Huawei has successfully merged the organizing principles of its Silicon Valley peers and the Chinese Communist Party and used both to achieve global success. This is the most revealing insight of “House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company,” by Washington Post technology reporter Eva Dou. Written by Washington Post technology reporter Eva Dou, right, “House of Huawei” is a rare and vital account of one of the world’s most influential global technology companies. (Source photos courtesy of Penguin Random&nbsp;House, Denis&nbsp;Largeron) Dou presents a comprehensive, deeply researched and insightful look into China’s largest and most infamous tech giant. In presenting the case for what Huawei has become, Dou does not stray beyond the facts, and rarely speculates about whether the company is (as the U.S. government and others claim) the pointy tip of the CCP’s cyberespionage spear. This sober examination is probably why the book has not received more attention. “House of Huawei” provides a brisk history of China’s telecoms manufacturing industry, from its early days in a market dominated by foreign joint ventures to its leading place in the current international array of domestic national champions. Dou links Huawei’s rise to the drive and earlier experiences of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, who began his career at an army base in Guizhou, on the Chinese border with Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. Ren’s army service has, as Dou notes, long served as his “original sin” in the eyes of Huawei’s detractors, but she points out that he spent his first two years as a cook and has claimed never to have worked in a signal intelligence capacity. Dou writes that Ren’s army days “helped shape his worldview,” but she does not believe that this period was the central ingredient in Huawei’s formation, nor its enduring success. Other places and moments in China’s economic transformation were more important: Ren’s fortuitous move to the entrepreneurial hotbed of Shenzhen, and his successful talent hunting in such centers of engineering excellence as the cities of Wuhan and Chongqing. “House of Huawei” portrays Ren and his colleagues as strivers, driven by a militaristic sense of purpose, tirelessly promoting and marketing the company to a fast-growing global list of clients. At the same time, the book provides several examples of the company’s attempts to control its public image, though these do not add up to a “secret history,” as the book’s subtitle suggests. These include sly revisions of its creation myth to minimize and in some cases obscure the participation of initial shareholders other than Ren. This comes off as slightly dodgy, but not overly so when compared to the early shareholder shenanigans of U.S. tech giants such as Facebook (now Meta). Huawei&nbsp;founder&nbsp;Ren Zhengfei, right, is pictured with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015. In “House of Huawei,” the company’s&nbsp;links to the Chinese Communist Party&nbsp;are well documented and placed in their proper context. &nbsp; © Getty Images Huawei is portrayed as a stalwart partner of the People’s Republic of China — an enterprise devoted to helping to modernize the country and burnish its fast-growing reputation as a global powerhouse. Ren’s company — and it is always Ren’s company, though he now owns only about 1% of the company’s shares — is shown to be politically bulletproof, but not a proxy actor of the Chinese state. This conclusion may have dampened the book’s reception. Many reviewers have expressed disappointment that Dou does not definitively tell us how much influence the Ministry of State Security wields over Huawei, or whether its overseas sales of switches and base stations have enabled signals intelligence for China’s international espionage efforts (as the U.S. has long claimed). That she does not speculate is a credit to Dou’s journalistic instincts, although it seems she felt compelled to do so in recounting the career of Sun Yafang, a former chairwoman with links to the MSS, of whom Dou tantalizingly writes that “perhaps that has something to do with her rapid rise through Huawei’s ranks, or perhaps not.” Huawei’s links to the CCP are well documented and placed in their proper context. A CCP party branch has been part of the company’s makeup since 1996, as was expected of any Chinese enterprise at the time, particularly one full of such commercial and technological promise. Dou looks closely at the career of Huawei’s first party branch secretary, Chen Zhufang, a retired engineer who is portrayed as a “stern grandmother” rather than an ideologue, who reinforced Huawei’s corporate culture rooted in hard, humble work. This balanced view is a tribute to solid research and reportage, despite Huawei’s lack of cooperation. Few of the quotes and anecdotes used from Dou’s interviews are insightful, however, giving the impression that they were included to show her authorial legwork. This is also true of an overlong account of the events following the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, Ren’s eldest daughter and at the time Huawei’s chief financial officer, by Canadian authorities in December 2018. Meng Wanzhou, eldest daughter of&nbsp;Huawei founder Ren, exits her vehicle after her court appearance in January 2020 in Vancouver, Canada. After a long legal saga, the U.S. dropped its fraud case against her in 2022. &nbsp; © Getty Images At the request of the U.S. Justice Department, which sought her extradition to stand trial for her alleged role in misleading Huawei’s banks about its business with Iran, which contravened American sanctions. This never happened: Canada released Meng in September 2021, and she returned to a hero’s welcome in China. The case was dropped by the U.S. in 2022. The tale of Meng’s trials and tribulations fizzles out anticlimactically at the end of “House of Huawei,” and it is a shame that Dou does not offer deeper insights about what the history of the episode means for the company’s future. But it does illustrate the lengths to which the U.S. has gone to isolate Huawei internationally, which have also included barring it from selling 5G and other network gear in the U.S., and convincing allies to do likewise. As Dou carefully documents, the underpinning rationale for the ongoing U.S. attempts to isolate Huawei was not based on clear evidence that the company was helping Chinese spymasters, but rather on the knowledge that U.S. companies were doing so for their own government. Dou’s failure to provide smoking guns may disappoint some, but “House of Huawei” does provide a clear picture of the forces that have underpinned and driven Huawei for decades. It is a rare and vital account of one of the world’s most influential global technology companies — which just happens to operate, as Dou concludes, in a way that is “strikingly similar to how the nation operates as a whole.” That fact is integral to its survival. The book does not shy away from Huawei’s provable bad deeds, from supplying surveillance gear to the Chinese government for use in Xinjiang province to building so-called smart cities for despotic regimes in Africa and the Middle East. But it is careful to portray Huawei as a technology company that operates like the Chinese state, not for it. That is a distinction the rest of the world should also make. “House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company” by Eva Dou (Penguin Random House, 2025) Ross O’Brien is a contributing writer. He has previously acted as a consultant to Huawei.",

    "description": "Tokyo Gas had cut back on its previously high shareholder returns to fund long-term growth investments. (Photo by Kosuke Imamura) Utility readies $800m buyback as battery, shale gas investments raise profit concerns SHINO KATAYAMA March 27, 2025 07:05 JST TOKYO — Tokyo Gas will repurchase up to 120 billion yen ($800 million) in stock during the first half of fiscal 2025, the utility said Wednesday, in a shift back toward shareholder returns as major growth investments have struggled to&nbsp;bear fruit. The full amount would match the record 120 billion yen in buybacks the Japanese utility&nbsp;conducted in all of fiscal 2024, and do so in half the time. Tokyo Gas said it will consider further buybacks in the second half “based on company performance,” and raised its annual dividend for fiscal 2024 by 10 yen per share to 80 yen. “Though long-term growth is important to us, we cannot meet stakeholders’ expectations unless we focus to some extent on short-term economics,” President Shinichi Sasayama said in a briefing, adding that the company will “sincerely face” skepticism about its ability to achieve its fiscal 2025 target of 8% return on equity. A disclosure released last fall showed Elliott Investment Management owned&nbsp;more than 5% of Tokyo Gas. The&nbsp;activist investor has been pressuring the company to sell assets and return money to shareholders, a source familiar with the situation said. Once known for its high returns for shareholders, Tokyo Gas changed tack over the past few years, with Sasayama saying “we want to give back to shareholders through sustainable growth.” In fiscal 2020, the utility changed its shareholder payout ratio policy, lowering the target from around 60% to roughly 40% by fiscal 2023. Meanwhile, the company&nbsp;has outlined plans to spend 650 billion yen on growth investments in the three years through fiscal 2025, up from 475.8 billion yen in the preceding three years. During this pivot, Tokyo Gas invested in areas such as storage batteries and North American shale gas development, but has yet to see notable successes. Its return on assets, based on adjusted ordinary profit, came to 4.2% last fiscal year, 3.8 percentage points lower than in fiscal 2012. “Investment in fossil fuels makes money in the short term, but there’s a lot of uncertainty over the medium to long term,” an analyst said. “Investments in renewable energy and decarbonization are likely to become profitable in the medium to long term, but don’t make money now — they’re tough.” Tokyo Gas has pared its shareholder returns to keep funding investments with a long time horizon. Its domestic city gas business, which generates steady profits, has become a smaller part of the portfolio. S&amp;P Global Ratings in November downgraded its outlook on the company’s long-term bonds from “stable” to “negative,” citing concerns about the possible impact of that shift on earnings and cash flow. Tokyo Gas is considering ways to boost profit&nbsp;while limiting outlays, such as acquiring usage rights to power generation and storage facilities owned by other companies. The utility plans to boost return on assets by divesting at least 100 billion yen in assets between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2028.",

The tariffs will be charged in addition to ones that are already in place.

    "description": "Uchida will become the first GPIF head to hail from one of Japan's top banks. (Source photos by Nikkei) Kazuto Uchida has experience managing funds, working overseas Nikkei staff writers March 27, 2025 05:33 JST TOKYO — Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) will have a bank veteran with extensive experience on the front line of fund management as its new chief next month. Former Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Director Kazuto Uchida will assume the top post at GPIF on April 1. “He has ample specialized knowledge and experience,” said Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare Takamaro Fukuoka at a Tuesday press conference announcing the appointment. Uchida will be the first GPIF head to hail from one of Japan’s top banks since the fund was established in 2006. GPIF, one of the world’s largest institutional investors, manages premiums paid to the country’s National Pension and Employees’ Pension Insurance system, with managed assets reaching 258 trillion yen ($1.71 trillion) at the end of 2024. It is often called a “whale” due to its investments’ sway on the market.&nbsp; Uchida joined Mitsubishi Bank — now MUFG Bank — in 1985 and has long been involved in fund management. He was head of the section responsible for investing in yen assets, mainly Japanese government bonds. He also served as head of the market department, overseeing fund investment both at home and overseas for two years. He also served as chairman of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “He provides balanced and neutral analysis of the market and the economy in general,” said Nomura Research Institute’s executive economist Takahide Kiuchi, who knows Uchida well. “He is knowledgeable about banking in general and has management experience.” SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Hidenori Suezawa noted that Uchida “has an international background, having worked in the U.S.” He is expected to tackle two goals: securing investment returns and strengthening the organization. GPIF’s investment returns have been strong, with assets under management increasing&nbsp;50% in the five years from the end of 2019 to the end of 2024. Success in pension asset management is judged by the effective yield — the difference&nbsp;between the rate of returns and the pace of nominal wage increases. GPIF’s stated target is 1.7%, with its actual results from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2023 averaging 4.24% per year. The welfare ministry will raise the effective yield target to 1.9% from fiscal 2025. Many companies have announced wage increases, and nominal wage growth is expected to accelerate. As Japanese interest rates rise above zero amid inflation, GPIF is expected to produce higher returns. Securing workers is also an issue. As assets under management increase, the skills required for investment and risk management also become more advanced.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Asia-needs-to-ensure-power-grids-are-in-step-with-renewables-growth",
    "description": "Technicians work to install a high voltage electric&nbsp;transmission&nbsp;line at the substation of Gujarat Solar Park in Gujarat, India on Sept, 12, 2024. © Reuters Upgrades are needed to unlock the full potential of wind and solar power projects Vandana Hari Vandana Hari March 27, 2025 05:05 JST Vandana Hari is founder of Vanda Insights, a Singapore-based global energy market intelligence provider. The recent boom in wind and solar power generation capacity has been hailed as a promising low-carbon solution to the world’s growing demand for energy, with governments doubling down on renewables as part of their net-zero emission targets. But a gaping hole has opened up in the execution of this strategy. Electricity grids around the world are struggling to integrate new solar and wind power projects — and the continued rapid growth in the latter will only make the situation worse. About 1,650 gigawatts of wind and solar projects in advanced stages of development around the world were waiting for grid connections as of July 2024, the International Energy Agency said in a February report. To put that in context, that figure is equivalent to around 52% of the current wind and solar capacity installed across the globe. Major developing economies in Asia are especially vulnerable to the downside of the growing disconnect between renewable power generation capacity and grid capacity due to multiple factors: A relatively high rate of urbanization spurring strong demand growth for power; the need for affordable, stable and accessible universal supply; rapidly growing reliance on oil and gas imports; and grid systems that are mostly government dominated. Investment in power transmission — the network of high-voltage power lines, substations, transformers and other infrastructure that moves electricity from power plants to the distribution networks that reach the final consumers — is woefully inadequate around the world, according to the IEA, but especially faces major funding gaps in developing economies. Countries looking to expand and upgrade their grids are also facing steep price hikes and long waits to get the critical components. On the supply side, there are limited equipment manufacturers globally, who in turn are struggling with supply chain bottlenecks, cost escalations and a shortage of skilled labor, leading to massive backlogs. Lead times for power transformers have doubled to four years and prices have rocketed 75% since 2019, while the waiting time for high-voltage cables has risen to three years and prices have nearly doubled since 2019, the IEA found. Grid integration is challenging for wind and solar projects because they are typically located in remote or rural areas, selected on the basis of access to land and sunlight or strong wind flows. As a result, they need the setting up of long-distance transmission networks — with the added complexity of underwater sea cables in the case of offshore wind — to deliver electricity to the grid. In contrast, coal- or gas-fired power plants are typically built near consumption centers, making them relatively easier to connect with existing high-voltage transmission networks. Intermittency in wind and solar projects — the loss of power output when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine — needs balancing mechanisms such as battery storage or pumped hydro, and “smart grid” systems that can allow grid operators to anticipate and manage the fluctuations, all of which also needs considerable investment. China has built an industry to produce the full array of transmission and distribution system components but is using much of its manufacturing capacity to serve galloping domestic demand, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. China added about 277 GW of new solar capacity in 2024, a 45% jump from 2023, and 80 GW of wind capacity for an increase of 18%. Southeast Asian countries, endowed with rich wind and solar power resources, need to avoid the trap of pursuing only one part of the renewables build-out equation while increasing their import dependency on an already stretched grid components sector. Workers install&nbsp;solar&nbsp;panels on Tseng Tien-fu’s vanilla&nbsp;farm&nbsp;in Taoyuan, Taiwan on&nbsp;May 30, 2022. &nbsp; © Reuters As the IEEFA puts it, solar panels and wind turbines are “the most identifiable symbols of the energy transition,” and Southeast Asian governments have encouraged and even mandated local production of these components. At the same time, downstream policy incentives have stimulated fund inflows into construction of wind and solar power plants. But the electricity grid appears to have been neglected. Governments in the region need to heed growing calls from prominent energy policy and research organizations to create fully grid-integrated supply projects and localize grid equipment supply chains. “Investment in transmission equipment production could be pivotal in ensuring energy security, reliability and availability,” according to the IEEFA. The International Renewable Energy Agency has urged Southeast Asian countries to invest in modernizing and expanding grid infrastructure, with a focus on adopting advanced technologies for grid flexibility and energy storage systems needed to accommodate the growing share of wind and solar power generation. In most countries in the region — with the exception of the Philippines — state-owned enterprises control power transmission and often also have a monopoly or dominant role in power generation and distribution, with governments regulating electricity tariffs. Policymakers need to quickly figure out ways to manage the dichotomy between power grids as a legacy state-owned and state-managed part of the electricity ecosystem and the demands of private sector-led, fast-growing wind and solar generation. Whether it is done through state funding or with the help of private investment, the expansion, upgradation and modernization of power grids through digitalization needs to be prioritized. On the flip side, not doing so in time may spur an irreversible exodus of investors from wind and solar projects. Policymakers need to find ways to catalyze local manufacturing of power grid components. It could be done at a national level, or through overseas joint ventures with existing players and financing from multilateral development banks. A good starting point would be to bring the boring but critical backbone of power grids to the fore in policymaking and industry discussions, regionally and internationally. While renewables and other forms of “green” power generation have become common on the agenda of oil and gas conferences in recent years, the grid has remained in the shadows. It’s encouraging to see the second-ever edition of the Astana International Forum in Kazakhstan, planned for May 29 and 30, which aims at finding solutions to the challenges of climate change, food shortages and energy security, dedicating a session exclusively to nations ensuring power supply stability amid the intermittency of renewables and supply chain issues. More conferences and seminars focused on the entire power sector ecosystem from generation to distribution are needed to facilitate the exchange of know-how and spur collaboration opportunities among industry players, policymakers, investors and think tanks. This has become critical if we are to prevent the wind and solar power bandwagon from decoupling and derailing.",

    "description": "Industry-based alliances working toward&nbsp;reaching net-zero emissions face headwinds as the Trump administration rolls back climate initiatives. © Reuters Industry climate initiative loses steam amid Trump rollbacks OKI HIDAKA and HARUKI KITAGAWA March 27, 2025 05:00 JST TOKYO — Tokio Marine Asset Management left an environmentally focused investor group at the end of February, Nikkei has learned, marking the first exit by a major Japanese player amid growing headwinds on global efforts to combat climate change. Tokio Marine Asset said it made the decision after reviewing the purpose of its membership, including whether participation in the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative was helping solve societal challenges. Tokio Marine Asset said it will not abandon contributions toward a creating decarbonized society. Other major Japanese asset managers, including Nomura Asset Management, Daiwa Asset Management and Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management, remained part of NZAM as of Wednesday. Sompo Asset Management, which like Tokio Marine Asset is a subsidiary of a nonlife insurance group, is still also part of the framework. Overseas, U.S.-based BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, exited NZAM in January, saying its membership “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” BlackRock has played a leading role in the sector’s efforts to address climate change risks. But Republican lawmakers have accused it of forcing green strategies on U.S. businesses. With U.S. President Donald Trump rolling back climate-related initiatives, BlackRock may be wary of drawing further criticism or losing business opportunities. Following BlackRock’s departure, NZAM said it would suspend activities while it reviews objectives and operations. It has also taken down its roster from the website. “Unless NZAM settles on its direction, we can’t decide on how we will respond as a company,” said an executive at a leading asset manager. Whether other Japanese players will follow Tokio Marine Asset remains to be seen. “We know there have been some departures overseas, but we can’t make the decision on our own since we manage assets belonging to other owners,” an industry insider said. “Depending on the situation, we may need to consider an exit,” said the head of one asset manager. In related fields, all three leading Japanese insurance groups, including Tokio Marine Asset’s parent, Tokio Marine Holdings, have exited the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Insurance Alliance. Six U.S. banks, including Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, as well as major Japanese players like Sumitomo Mitsui Banking , have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, another U.N.-backed group, since December.",

    "description": "Tesla&nbsp;sells in other Middle Eastern countries, but not in Saudi Arabia. © Reuters Sales start in April, five years after feud with PIF over taking automaker private March 27, 2025 04:11 JST RIYADH (Reuters) —&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;will start sales in Saudi Arabia next month, the electric carmaker said on its website, signaling CEO&nbsp;Elon Musk&nbsp;and the kingdom have healed a rift that dates back to the billionaire’s short-lived bid in 2018 to take the company private. Tesla&nbsp;sells in other Middle Eastern countries, but not in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf region’s largest market, where EVs only account for 1% of total car sales. The brand has had considerable success in neighboring United Arab Emirates, where most ride-hailing apps offer electric vehicles. The dispute started when Musk tweeted in 2018 he had “funding secured” to take&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;private after a meeting with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. That tweet eventually led to a lawsuit from investors when a bid failed to materialize, during which tense text messages between Musk and PIF head Yasir al-Rumayyan were made public. Tensions have eased since the autumn, when Musk took a high-profile role in U.S. President&nbsp;Donald Trump’s election campaign and then new administration. Trump said this month he would likely make his first trip abroad to Saudi Arabia, after asking the kingdom in January to spend upward&nbsp;of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy&nbsp;over four years, including military purchases. EVs from China’s BYD&nbsp;and PIF-backed Lucid&nbsp;are already available in the Saudi market. EV sales have been slow in Saudi Arabia, with a 2024 report from consultants PwC putting them at just 1% of all car sales. Tesla’s launch event in Riyadh, scheduled for April 10, will display its EVs and products powered by solar energy, the post said. “Experience the future of autonomous driving with Cybercab, and meet Optimus, our humanoid robot, as we showcase what’s next in AI and robotics,” it added. On April 11, it will open pop-up stores in Riyadh, Jeddah&nbsp;and Dammam,&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;said in a later statement, adding it would announce further details of its plans for Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks, with investment planned for 2025 and beyond. Invitations to the launch event asked guests to indicate which&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;car model they were interested in. A month after the feud with Musk went public, the PIF announced a $1-billion-plus investment in Lucid, becoming the majority investor in one of the EV startups looking to challenge&nbsp;Tesla. PIF, which has assets under management of $925 billion, has also invested in a domestic EV brand that is yet to launch called Ceer. Yet large, gas-guzzling vehicles remain the norm on Saudi roads where fuel is cheap and&nbsp;EV&nbsp;charging infrastructure remains a rarity, making traversing its long desert roads almost impossible in an EV. The launch comes as&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;has seen EV sales&nbsp;slump&nbsp;in Europe, blamed on Musk’s support for far right politicians, and the brand has been targeted by protesters in the United States over his spearheading of sweeping cuts to the federal government. In one of the first signs of improving relations, Musk appeared alongside Rumayyan and Trump in ringside seats at a UFC mixed martial arts match in New York in November. A few weeks earlier, Musk had made a surprise appearance at Riyadh’s Future Investment Initiative summit via video link. A U.S.&nbsp;jury&nbsp;found in 2023 that Musk was not liable for misleading investors when he tweeted funding was secured to take&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;private. Musk testified it was the PIF that had wanted to take&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;private when he posted that tweet, and a series of tense text messages between him and Rumayyan emerged during the case. “You are throwing me under the bus,” Musk wrote in a text to Rumayyan, according to court documents. Tesla’s sales in Europe are down 42.6% so far this year, data&nbsp;showed&nbsp;on Tuesday, even as demand for EVs rises. Activists across the U.S. have staged “Tesla&nbsp;Takedown” demonstrations over Musk’s role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which has cut&nbsp;thousands of jobs, frozen foreign aid and canceled thousands of programs and contracts.",

    "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Panama-port-deal-puts-prophet-Li-Ka-shing-to-the-test",
    "description": "Li Ka-shing might look like he is caught in the middle of a Donald Trump-Xi Jinping feud, but history shows he has a knack for maneuvering around&nbsp;politics and ahead of economic trends. (Nikkei montage/Source photos by Reuters and Yusuke Hinata) The Hong Kong tycoon's move comes as the U.S. and China ratchet up tensions KATSUJI NAKAZAWA KATSUJI NAKAZAWA March 27, 2025 04:00 JST Katsuji Nakazawa is a Tokyo-based senior staff and editorial writer at Nikkei. He spent seven years in China as a correspondent and later as China bureau chief. He was the 2014 recipient of the Vaughn-Ueda International Journalist prize. CK Hutchison founder Li Ka-shing has made his way back into the global spotlight by deciding to sell the rights to operate ports on either side of the Panama Canal, which has become a pain point in U.S.-China tensions. While the Hong Kong tycoon’s move might win him points in Washington, it has put him in Beijing’s crosshairs. But Li might not even feel the pressure. The 96-year-old billionaire has a well-established reputation for his ability to see what is likely to happen in the future and to take appropriate action. He is known to have correctly predicted a dramatic change in the Chinese real estate market and sold off many mainland assets before the country’s property bubble started to collapse in 2021. So has the man who has witnessed decades of fierce power struggles within the Chinese Communist Party made another prediction, one about U.S.-China relations? Li Ka-shing made inroads into China in the first half of the 1990s by deepening relationships with companies affiliated with the Ministry of Transport. &nbsp; © Reuters Exactly 30 years ago, Li learned firsthand the dark side of Chinese politics through his involvement in a huge development project in Wangfujing, a busy shopping district in central Beijing. Wangfujing is not far from Zhongnanhai, the country’s political nerve center where party leaders have their offices. On April 4, 1995, gunfire rang out in a suburb of Beijing, and Wang Baosen, Beijing’s then-most senior vice mayor, was found dead. It is said he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. Wang’s shocking death developed into a major corruption scandal that rocked Chinese politics. Shortly afterward, Chen Xitong, who was Beijing’s top official and a key member of the “Beijing faction,” was purged for corruption. Chen, who was a member of the party’s powerful Politburo, was eventually sentenced to 16 years in prison, and questions were later raised about whether his corruption charge had more to do with a serious crime. After the deadly Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy students in 1989, Jiang Zemin, then Shanghai’s top official, was suddenly tapped as the party’s general secretary. Jiang replaced Zhao Ziyang, who was purged in the wake of Tiananmen Square for showing a sympathetic attitude toward the protesting students. Jiang was “a new face” in Beijing. Although he had the backing of then-supreme leader Deng Xiaoping, his own political base was extremely weak. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng join a news conference at The&nbsp;Great Hall of the People in&nbsp;Beijing on Sept.&nbsp;26, 1989. Jiang became&nbsp;the party’s general secretary that year. &nbsp; © Reuters In essence, Chen’s downfall was the result of a dog-eat-dog power struggle within the party. Jiang, who led the “Shanghai faction,” drove Chen out to consolidate his power as the influential Beijing faction member had stood in his way. Chen’s corruption case involved Li’s massive development project in Wangfujing. Li must have felt his blood freeze as he was seen as being at the center of the case. But the case — in essence an outgrowth of a party power struggle — only impacted the Hong Kong tycoon temporarily. Li made inroads into China in the first half of the 1990s, after Tiananmen Square sparked harsh Western sanctions. He deepened his relationships with companies affiliated with the Ministry of Transport, including in the port and terminal business. Around the time of the 1995 corruption scandal involving Chen, Li began to forge an even closer relationship with Jiang, who won his power struggle and cemented his position as successor to the aged Deng. Connections to Jiang and those close to him who controlled China’s transport-related sectors were a tremendous asset for Li. They paved the way for China to support one of CK Hutchison’s subsidiaries to acquire the rights to operate the two Panama ports. Li was indebted to Deng and Jiang for helping his business expand in China and beyond. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tours the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City on Feb. 2. After the U.S. made the canal a point of contention between itself and China, Panama announced it would withdraw from the China-led Belt and Road Initiative in 2026. (Pool photo/Reuters) The CK Hutchison subsidiary acquired the rights from the Panamanian government in 1997. The handover of Hong Kong from the U.K. to China also took place that year. The ports in question are the port of Balboa on the Pacific side of the canal and the port of Cristobal on the Atlantic side. In 2021, four years after the U.K. handed over Hong Kong, China joined the World Trade Organization under Jiang, and U.S.-China trade quickly expanded. As a result, CK Hutchison’s profits from operating the Panama ports grew. This trend accelerated during the era of Jiang’s successor, Hu Jintao, as the Chinese economy grew rapidly. But China, its economy and the world it exists in have drastically changed since Xi Jinping took over from Hu as party general secretary in 2012. The change in U.S.-China relations has been especially dramatic. When Donald Trump, who in January was inaugurated for a second term as U.S. president, declared he would take back the Panama Canal, CK Hutchison faced the possibility of becoming a direct target. Despite Trump’s threat coming suddenly, it was not long before Panama announced it would withdraw from the China-led Belt and Road Initiative in 2026, when its memorandum of understanding with China to cooperate on the global infrastructure drive is due to expire. With Panama more or less bowing to Trump, suddenly the threat to CK Hutchison became all the more real. Li moved quickly. On March 4, his conglomerate signed an agreement to sell its non-Chinese port assets, including the two Panama Canal ports, to a consortium led by U.S. asset management firm BlackRock. An unhappy Xi administration responded to the announced deal, albeit indirectly, after the National People’s Congress, China’s national legislature, ended its annual session on March 11. The Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the party’s Central Committee reposted on its website a harshly critical article published in Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese government-affiliated Hong Kong newspaper. This commentary published by Ta Kung Pao suggests it is “understandable” that many would view the Panama deal as&nbsp;a betrayal of the Chinese people. (Photo by Kenji Kawase) The article lashed out at the deal, claiming it would undermine China’s national security and interests. Ta Kung Pao also published a commentary calling for CK Hutchison to halt the transaction and suggesting the deal would violate the national security ordinance, which took effect in Hong Kong a year ago. It remains unclear whether Beijing’s indirect pressure could lead to CK Hutchison reconsidering its decision. CK Hutchison is a private company, not state-owned. The conglomerate is huge but does not have the power to shrug off the political risk that comes from being caught between the world’s two largest economic foes. Although the Xi administration often stresses the need for “patriotism” and “national security,” there is no way it could protect CK Hutchison from the pressure that would be piled onto it by a determined U.S. Three decades ago, with the handover looming, Hong Kong companies began moving closer to mainland China under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised “a high degree of autonomy” for the former British colony. Deng firmly pledged to keep the formula unchanged for 50 years after the handover. Jiang and Hu maintained the guarantee, which has since disintegrated. In the new political reality, it is only natural for Hong Kong merchants to behave differently. Li was born in China’s Guangdong province, adjacent to Hong Kong, in 1928. His long life has allowed him to observe many chapters of Chinese history. The lessons he has taken away have taught him how to be quick to seize an opportunity. Li Ka-shing, chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings, waves goodbye to journalists as he formally retires after the company’s annual general meeting in Hong Kong on&nbsp;May 10, 2018.&nbsp;Li would burnish his&nbsp;reputation as “a prophet” some three years later. &nbsp; © Reuters He has also gained the ability to correctly predict where China’s economy and politics — and the international political and economic situations surrounding China — are headed. He demonstrated his foresight by gradually selling off many of his mainland property holdings after Xi became China’s top leader. Prominent Chinese real estate moguls were paying attention to the Hong Kong billionaire’s low-profile asset sell-off, and some of them also escaped the implosion unscathed by following Li’s example. As a result, Li’s reputation as “a prophet” became rock-solid. This time, Li has decided to divest CK Hutchison’s operating rights for many overseas ports even as they generate profits. Will this also prove prescient?",

    "description": "Japan's banks are rushing to bolster their foundations with the country's interest rates finally rising. (Photo by Yutaka Miyaguchi) Chiba Bank would become Chiba Kogyo's top shareholder in $130mn deal RYUTA MINAMIHATA March 27, 2025 00:08 JST TOKYO — Japanese regional lender Chiba Bank is finalizing plans to acquire&nbsp;a nearly&nbsp;20% stake in peer Chiba Kogyo Bank for an estimated 20 billion yen ($133 million), Nikkei has learned, looking&nbsp;to bolster its foundation&nbsp;as interest rates rise. Chiba Bank, the largest regional bank&nbsp;in Chiba prefecture, just east of Tokyo, will purchase the shares from Ariake Capital, an investment company that targets regional lenders and other entities. Under the share transfer agreement&nbsp;expected soon, Chiba Bank&nbsp;will acquire 19.9% of the shares in Chiba Kogyo, the prefecture’s third largest regional bank, on a voting rights basis. Ariake Capital began making substantial investments in Chiba Kogyo around 2022, providing&nbsp;advice on improving management. It became the largest shareholder in January 2025. Chiba Kogyo’s market capitalization stands around&nbsp;90 billion yen, making the stake to be acquired by Chiba Bank worth about 18 billion yen. Chiba Bank is expected to become the largest shareholder. Several large regional banks have been able to coexist in Chiba, given the prefecture’s large population and numerous&nbsp;companies stemming from its location in the greater Tokyo metro area. But population decline in southern Chiba has led to consolidation of some branches. With the Bank of Japan moving last year to reverse its longtime negative interest rate policy, and with further rate hikes on the horizon, banks are rushing to solidify their foundations in order to acquire deposits and support business partners. Chiba Kogyo was established in 1952. When Japan’s economic bubble burst, the bank&nbsp;was left with many bad loans and received public funds in 2000. Even after paying off its debt, the lender&nbsp;had to deal with the redemption of preferred shares, which carried a heavy dividend burden. Japan’s Financial Services Agency requires companies that acquire a 20% stake or more of banks and other institutions to obtain authorization for such reasons as ensuring management stability. Chiba Bank and Chiba Kogyo will discuss their future structure and cooperative relationship. Chiba Bank appears to be considering acquiring more than 20% to strengthen the relationship further. As the two banks deepen their relationship, the response of major Japanese lender Mizuho Bank, which holds 12.6% of Chiba Kogyo’s shares, also will be a focus. Mizuho’s predecessor, the former Fuji Bank, took on&nbsp;Chiba Kogyo’s capital increases. Mizuho counted&nbsp;Chiba Kogyo as an equity method affiliate for many years, until 2023.",

But her artistry, not just her athleticism, may be what changes the sport When Amber Glenn takes the ice for the free skate on Friday night at the world figure skating championships in Boston after a disappointing short program , fans will be holding their breath. Undefeated this season, she was seen as the one to beat. The Grand Prix final Champion , two-time US champion , the only woman to regularly land a triple Axel in competition (on which she suffered an uncharacteristic fall, landing her ninth place in the short on Wednesday afternoon), she had been tipped to become the first US woman to win the world title in nearly 20 years.

Slender, with blonde curled hair framing her perfectly made up face, she doesn’t overtly break the mold. But when the music starts, something else takes over. She’s explosive; her movements deliberate, and there’s a weight to her actions that not only enables her to drive across the ice like a hockey player, but to display exquisite musicality, showcasing a sensitivity and showmanship that has gained her a devoted fanbase (and 1.5m TikTok followers ).

Lawson has been dropped before next weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix after the New Zealander has completed just two races for the team. The decision to remove the 23-year-old, not the first time Red Bull have acted with such emphatic purpose towards an underperforming driver, was blunt even by the team’s previous standards and an indication that they demand the capability to compete for the Formula One constructors’ championship as a priority. Lawson will revert to race for RB for the rest of the season. Continue reading...",

For the world’s greatest player, it wasn’t the best penalty. More an untidy scuff into the bottom corner. But it was enough for Pelé and his Santos team to open the scoring in a 3-0 friendly win over lowly Botafogo da Paraiba. More importantly, it marked the great man’s 999th senior goal. Or did it?
