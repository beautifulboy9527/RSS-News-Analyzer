    "description": "萨姆·卡布拉尔（Sam Cabral） BBC新闻，华盛顿 15 分钟前 蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Walz） 蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Walz）起初是卡马拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）的潜在副手人选中名不见经传的一位。但随着他在电视节目上的一句“这些人就是怪”走红，他一跃成为民主党副总统候选人。 现年60岁的蒂姆·沃尔兹以接地气、坦率和犀利回应共和党反对派发起的进攻。 他还拥有一份引人注目的履历——在从政前，他曾担任过公立学校教师、美式橄榄球教练和国民警卫队队员。 他曾在国会代表一个倾向共和党的选区，后来又在明尼苏达州州长任上通过了左翼政策。在美国政治两极分化的今天，他的从政经历可能具有广泛的吸引力。 教师、教练和议员 沃尔兹出生于内布拉斯加州乡村，曾在夏天务农和打猎，17岁时加入美国陆军国民警卫队。他在这支志愿部队服役长达24年。 沃尔兹的父亲是一名公立学校行政人员，曾鼓励他参军。19岁时，他的父亲因肺癌去世。 这位明尼苏达州州长曾谈到他的母亲靠社会保障遗属津贴维生，而《美国军人权利法案》帮其支付了大学学费。 凭借教师学位，沃尔兹在1989年“六四”天安门镇压事件发生前后，赴中国担任了一年教师。 后来，他与妻子格温·惠普尔（Gwen Whipple）前往中国度蜜月，还组织美国学生暑期到中国游学。 回到内布拉斯加州家乡后，沃尔兹当上了老师和美式橄榄球教练，直到他的妻子（学校另一名教师）带他回到了明尼苏达州的家乡。他们现在育有两个孩子。 作为曼卡托西高中（Mankato West High School）的教练，沃尔兹帮助学校建立了美式橄榄球项目，并带领学校首次获得州冠军。 他还因同意担任学校同志与非同志联盟的指导老师而赢得赞誉，当时同性恋在很大程度上受到人们的排斥。 他最初在明尼苏达州南部一个以农业为主的地区竞选公职，这个地区非常乡村，倾向于共和党。 但沃尔兹因在竞选中表现得温和及关注公共服务和退伍军人权益而爆冷。 图像来源， Getty Images 2007 年众议院伊拉克投票后，蒂姆·沃尔兹和南希·佩洛西等一众的留影。 观点和信仰 在沃尔兹12年的国会生涯中，很难给他的意识形态贴上标签。 他投票支持《平价医疗法案》，共同发起了包括提高最低工资法案在内的有利于劳工的措施，并支持一项未获成功的减少碳排放的限额交易措施。 但他也找到了与共和党人的共同点。 他投票支持继续为伊拉克和阿富汗战争提供资金，支持对进入美国的难民进行更严格审查，并试图阻止奥巴马时代在2008年金融危机后对银行和汽车公司的救助。 支持拥枪权的全国步枪协会曾为他的竞选活动捐款。但在2018年佛罗里达帕克兰校园枪击案发生后，他公开表示支持禁止攻击性武器，因此失去了该协会的支持。 2018年，沃尔兹在明尼苏达州州长竞选中以超过11个百分点的优势胜出，但他的首个任期因新冠疫情和明尼阿波利斯警察杀害乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）事件而蒙上阴影。 共和党人严厉批评沃尔兹在抗议活动愈演愈烈时，仍迟迟没有部署国民警卫队。 但这名州长赢得了连任。在民主党以一个席位的优势控制着州议会的情况下，他的第二个任期相当忙碌。 该州民主党人将堕胎权奉为圭臬、制定了带薪事假和病假、加强了枪支法、为学校普及免费膳食提供资金，并对经济适用房进行投资。 这一系列紧锣密鼓的活动引起了前总统贝拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）的注意，他写道： “ 如果你需要一个实例证明选举是会产生影响的，看看明尼苏达州正在发生什么。” 图像来源， Getty Images 蒂姆·沃尔兹在从政之前是一名公立学校教师、橄榄球教练和国民警卫队成员。 “这些人都很怪” 沃尔兹在全国范围内知名度并不高，但最近几周，他对共和党人的尖刻描述迅速引起了热议。 “ 另一方都是怪人。 &quot;他最近在美国媒体MSNBC上说出这个频繁使用的标签。 “ 他们想要禁书。 他们想进入你（医生）的检查室。” 但共和党人很快就攻击他在明尼苏达州的所作所为，称其对普通美国人来说过于激进。 美国众议院排名第三的共和党人汤姆·埃默（Tom Emmer）指责沃尔兹试图 “ 把明尼苏达州变成卡马拉·哈里斯的家乡加利福尼亚州。” 但包括劳工领袖在内的盟友认为，沃尔兹可以扩大卡马拉·哈里斯对农村和工人阶级选民的吸引力。 众议院民主党人安吉·克雷格（Angie Craig）正在为连任展开激烈的竞争，她称赞沃尔兹是 “ 久经考验的领导者。” 她告诉BBC，沃尔兹是 “ 公认的赢家，在许多艰难的竞选中从未失败过”，她相信他将是卡马拉·哈里斯的最佳副手人选。",

    "description": "2024年7月29日 一场由变装艺术家演绎的宴会场景引来了基督教团体的批评，认为这一幕戏虐性地模仿了重要的圣经场景“最后的晚餐”。 巴黎奥运开幕至今，尺度较大的开幕式上若干细节成为遭到热议的话题，在各项赛事开始之后，赛场上也有争议现象出现。国际奥委会、巴黎奥组委甚至已对一些事件进行解释和道歉。 以下是BBC整理的本届奥运会截至目前的几大争议场面，以及其发酵讨论过程。 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 2024年巴黎奥运会有什么独特之处？ 奥组委为开幕式冒犯感“道歉” 一场由变装艺术家演绎的宴会场景引来了基督教团体的批评，认为这一幕戏虐性地模仿了文艺复兴时期著名画家达芬奇的名画“最后的晚餐”。 这幅名画描绘的是一个重要的圣经场景。 批评者之一法国天主教会（Catholic Church in France）表示，开幕式突出了“嘲弄、蔑视基督教的场景”。 图像来源， EPA 巴黎奥运开幕式上的表演包括演绎一场晚餐，以及模仿希腊神话酒神狄俄尼索斯，引发了批评。 美国电讯公司C Spire表示，在“被开幕式上对最后的晚餐进行的嘲弄震惊”后，正在撤下奥运会的周边广告。 意大利副总理萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）、美国众议院议长约翰逊（Mike Johnson）也提出批评，认为对《最后的晚餐》的嘲弄，令全球基督徒感到震惊及侮辱。 开幕式艺术总监若利（Thomas Jolly）表示，绝没有故意嘲弄或蔑视任何人，存在争议的场景是为了代表异教徒诸神。 “很明显，从来没有故意不尊重任何宗教群体的意图。”巴黎奥组委发言人德尚（Anne Descamps）周日（7月28日）对记者表示。 她说，“与之相反，我认为若利努力歌颂社区包容。我们相信这雄心壮志已经实现，若有任何人感到被冒犯，我们真的非常抱歉。” 若利也对法国媒体表示，“这个创意是为了展示一场和奥林匹斯众神有关的、盛大的多神的派对。” “在我的作品中你看不到嘲笑任何人的意图。我想要的是把人们团结在一起、调和各方的开幕式，同时展现自由、平等、博爱的法国大革命精神。” 错将韩国当朝鲜 国际奥委会道歉 图像来源， Reuters 在韩国代表团乘船参加开幕式时，法语及英语播报员介绍他们时都用的“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国”（Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea），毫无疑问这正是朝鲜（北韩）的官方名称。 这个名字稍后又被播报，不过这次用对了地方，介绍的是入场的朝鲜代表团。 南北朝鲜自从二战结束后分治，双方的紧张局势近日还有所升温。 不过，电视字幕上提供的名字是正确的。 韩国文化体育观光部随后表示，会就此过失向法国政府进行强烈抗议和投诉。该声明说，对于这一播报表示遗憾，因为韩国代表团被介绍为了朝鲜队。 该国文化体育观光部副部长张美兰（Jang Mi-ran）还要求就此事和国际奥委会主席巴赫进行会谈。 国际奥委会已经在其官方X（前推特）账号里称，“我们要就韩国代表团在开幕式上被错误介绍一事表示深深的道歉。” 前强奸犯参赛被嘘 图像来源， Getty Images 曾经犯下强奸儿童罪的荷兰沙滩排球运动员史蒂文·范德费尔德（Steven van de Velde）首次出现在奥运赛场，收获了掌声和嘘声。 2016年他因强奸一名12岁的英国女孩被判四年监禁。一年后获假释出狱，有犯罪纪录。 他和搭档目前世界排名第10，在埃菲尔铁塔体育场的首秀中败于一对意大利组合。他们将于31日出战下一场比赛。 范德费尔德在比赛前被介绍给观众时，赛场同时出现掌声和嘘声。 在首场比赛前，一份网络请愿呼吁禁止他参加奥运会，这份请愿书获得了9万签名。 有观众对BBC体育说出了自己的观点。 一位英国观众说，“他表现出了开放和诚实……但我个人觉得他们做出了一个艰难的决定。” 另一位英国观众说，“他们应该选择其他人，以避免引起争议。如果这是一个英国人，我可不愿让他出现在我们的队伍中。” 但一位荷兰观众说，范德费尔德参赛是对的，“他已经受到了惩罚，都结束了。他可以像其他人一样继续生活。” 范德费尔德此前接受荷兰媒体采访时说，“我无法改变（观众），因此我必须承受后果。这是我人生中的最大错误。” 国际奥委会表示，运动员的选择权在国家奥委会。 范德费尔德2017年重回赛场，荷兰奥委会说，他已经满足了荷兰排球联合会关于运动员犯罪后重返赛场的标准。",

    "description": "24 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 巴黎奥运会的金银铜牌 在巴黎奥运会的拳击和田径两个项目中，夺冠的运动员获得的不仅仅是奖牌。 1896年，现代奥运会在雅典拉开帷幕，当时这是一项严格意义上的业余赛事，既没有职业运动员，也不允许提供奖金。 然而，在今年夏天的巴黎，运动员中既有年收入数亿美元的超级富豪，也有艰难负担比赛费用的参赛者。 奥运选手的收入来源多种多样：赞助商、国家给予的经济奖励，以及本届首次在奥运会上发放的奖金。 由于并非每个项目都有奖金，这一决定引发了争议，即如何最好地分配奥运会带来的财富。 2024巴黎奥运奖牌榜 张家朗、江旻憓巴黎奥运夺金 拆解香港如何成为剑击之城 仅限拳击和田径 图像来源， Getty Images 朱利安·阿尔弗雷德 (Julien Alfred) 在赢得女子 100米冠军后将获得 50,000 美元奖金以及金牌。 朱利安·阿尔弗雷德（​Julien Alfred）在夺得女子100米冠军后，将获得5万美元奖金和金牌。 在2024年巴黎奥运会的32个体育项目中，只有田径和拳击两个项目可以获得奖金。 今年4月，国际田径管理机构世界田联（World Athletics）出人意料地宣布，2024年巴黎奥运会金牌得主将获得5万美元（3.94万英镑）的奖金。 一个月后，国际拳击协会（IBA）表示，该机构也将向奥运冠军发放10万美元（7.87万英镑）的奖金，不过其中四分之一将归运动员所在国的拳击协会所有，另外四分之一归教练所有。 在这两项运动中，银牌和铜牌获得者的奖金较少。而拳击比赛中，排名前五的选手都将获得奖励。 这些奖金并非直接来自奥运会主办方，而是来自这两个项目的管理机构。 世界田联正在使用从国际奥委会（IOC）获得的部分资金，这些资金是奥运会收入的一部分。而这笔钱以前被用于更广泛的运动员培养，有人质疑设立奖金是否是明智之举。 考文垂大学（Coventry University）社会商业中心的汤姆·巴森（Tom Bason）博士专门研究大型体育赛事。他说：“奖金流向获胜者，这或许强化了顶级运动员是有偿（竞技）的事实。” “在田径项目上夺金的人，很可能已经是那些拥有巨额赞助和代言合同的人了。” “其中一种批评声是，这笔钱可以更好地用于培养运动员，把钱花在年轻运动员身上，而不是那些在比赛中名列前茅的人。” 不过，考虑到一些奥运冠军曾陷入经济困境，他们亦能从额外的收入中受益。苏联体操传奇人物奥尔加·科尔布特（Olga Korbut）在其奥运生涯中获得了四枚金牌和两枚银牌。但在2017年，她不得不以33.35万美元的价格出售了自己的三枚奖牌。 拳击比赛奖金的来源则不太清楚。国际奥委会最近断绝了与国际拳击协会的一切联系，理由是后者的运作“缺乏财务透明度。” “与以往国际拳击协会的资金一样，这笔钱的来源尚不清楚。”国际奥委会在一份公开声明中说。 巴森博士补充说：“也许有人会说，国际拳击协会这样做是为了让自己成为奥运会的一部分，并与其保持密切联系。” 民族自豪感 图像来源， Getty Images 运动员在奥运会上获得奖牌后，还有很多其他方式可以获得经济奖励。 许多运动员会因为能登上领奖台，而获得所在国家的奖励。 新加坡被认为是在支付奖金方面最慷慨的地方之一，每位巴黎的金牌得主将获得75万美元的奖金。 东道主法国的奖金为8万欧元（8.7万美元），而摩洛哥运动员的奖金更高，为20万美元。 美国则更少，该国的“黄金行动”（Operation Gold）基金向运动员发放3.75万美元。 英国等国则完全不向奖牌得主提供经济奖励。 取而代之的是，英国国家队在奥运会前会向运动员提供一定数额的资助。被认定有很大机会夺金的选手每年最多可获得2.8万英镑。 虽然这些钱绝非小数目，但与世界上最著名的运动员所能赚取的巨额财富相比，还是相差甚远。 “（参加奥运会的）运动员中，既有像美国篮球队那样拿着高薪的球员，也有靠兼职工作养活自己的运动员。”巴森博士说。 明星的力量 图像来源， Getty Images NBA 巨星NBA 巨星勒布朗·詹姆斯是奥运会上收入最高的运动员之一。 根据《福布斯》发布的年度体育富豪榜，西班牙高尔夫名将乔恩·拉姆（Jon Rahm）是2024年巴黎奥运会收入最高的运动员。据这本财经杂志估计，拉姆去年的收入为2.18亿美元，其中大部分收入来自备受争议的由沙特资助的LIV高尔夫巡回赛。 意料之中的是，收入排名第二的是美国明星篮球运动员勒布朗·詹姆斯（Lebron James）。据信，他的收入为1.28亿美元。 由于高尔夫和篮球在国际上的影响力巨大，参加奥运会可能对拉姆和詹姆斯本已丰厚的收入影响不大。 但对于知名度较低的运动员来说，赢得奖牌可以帮助他们增加收入，这是他们所急需的。 他们通常会在代言合同中写入一项条款，规定如果他们登上领奖台，就可从赞助商那里获得奖金。 这些条款一般都是保密的，但2016年耐克（Nike）和新百伦（New Balance）的一场法律纠纷披露，如果美国长跑选手鲍里斯·贝里安（Boris Berian）在奥运会上夺金，将获得15万美元的奖金。 “我想很多人看到美国顶级运动员或为欧洲球队效力的国际足球运动员，就认为每名运动员都可以动辄每周挣10万、20万美元，但事实远非如此。”巴森博士说。 “有许多运动员都在为生计而挣扎。几年前，澳大利亚曾做过一项研究，他们发现目前在为2032年奥运会进行训练的运动员中，有40%的人都有一份兼职或全职工作。” 即使是在拥有许多世界上最富有的体育明星的美国，许多选手的生活也依然不易。​ 美国奥委会和残奥委会最近的一项研究发现，26.5%的现役运动员年收入低于1.5万美元。 跳过 YouTube 帖子, 1 允许Google YouTube内容 此文包含Google YouTube提供的内容。由于这些内容会使用曲奇或小甜饼等科技，我们在加载任何内容前会寻求您的认可。 您可能在给与许可前愿意阅读Google YouTube 小甜饼政策 和 隐私政策 。 希望阅读上述内容，请点击“接受并继续”。 Accept and continue 告知：第三方内容可能包含广告 结尾 YouTube 帖子, 1 无内容 继续浏览 YouTube BBC对外部网站内容不负责任。 未来的变化 2024年巴黎奥运会颁发的每枚奖牌上，都有一小块取自埃菲尔铁塔的铁片。 向顶级运动员发放奖金是否是体育协会资金的最佳用途，这一激烈的辩论将继续，很可能会扩大到田径和拳击以外的领域。 “（各运动的）体育协会肯定会面临支付奖金的压力。”巴森博士说。 不过，这可能会给媒体曝光率较低的体育项目带来问题，从而导致资金短缺。 “田径和国际拳击是世界上最受瞩目的两项运动。&quot;巴森博士说。“这两项运动将更容易从赞助和代言中获得额外资金。” “而其他运动项目，比如皮划艇，如果它有支付运动员奖金的压力，可能就不那么容易了。” 2024年巴黎奥运会的冠军们至少可以安慰自己，他们将至少获得一枚金牌。 那金牌价值几何？ 今年的奥运金牌含有505克银和6克金——自1912年以来金牌就不是纯金的——其原始价值为950美元。 但巴黎的奥运冠军们希望，他们的夺金记忆是无价的。",

    "description": "22 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 周一日本股市盘中跌幅已经超过了1987年的“黑色星期一”。 日本股市坐上“过山车”——周一（8月5日）暴跌，经历“黑色星期一”，周二则大幅反弹。 本周一，日经225指数跌12.4%，收报31506点，已抹去今年以来所有涨幅。其盘中跌幅已经超过了1987年的“黑色星期一”，收盘跌幅12.4%则是日本股市历史上第二大跌幅。 不仅日本，亚洲股市普遍暴跌，韩国综合指数盘中跌幅一度扩大至10%，为2008年以来最大跌幅，收跌8.77%；台湾股市方面，台湾证交所加权股价指数收跌8.35%，为历史最大单日跌幅，其中台积电领跌大盘，股价跳水9.8%。此外，印度、澳洲、新加坡股指都在不同程度大跌。 到美国开盘时间，股市重挫，尤其是科技股。纳斯达克指数崩跌超过1000点，达6.34％；标普500跌3.65％。 这一轮大跌中，中国A股和香港股市躲过一劫，仅小幅下跌。 周二，日本股市又大幅反弹。开盘后一度涨幅超过10%，收复前一天大部分跌幅。韩国开盘上涨4%，台湾上涨3%。 三点原因导致暴跌 周一暴跌的原因何在？ 穆迪分析（Moody’s Analytics）列出了三点原因： 暴跌很大程度上反映了人们对美国可能走向衰退的担忧； 尽管经济数据不佳且通胀放缓，但日本央行上周三却意外上调了短期政策利率，并表示未来还将上调更多利率，日元因此飙升，而此举削弱了日本制造业的出口竞争力，因此日本股市受到打击尤为严重； 与人工智能相关的科技股也受到冲击，影响了台湾和韩国的股票估值，这些地区的芯片制造商生产了全球大部分用于人工智能应用的高端半导体。 换言之，恐慌情绪的源头来源于美国最近经济数据带来的担忧；日本因为恰好上调利率，导致日元飙升，连锁反应下，受伤尤为严重；而韩国、台湾受到连累，科技股受伤较重，而上述两国股市科技股成分较高，与美日市场关联也大。 上周五，美国公布就业数据，7 月份美国经济新增就业岗位 11.4 万个，低于投资者预期的 17.5 万个。失业率升到三年来最高水平，加重了市场对美国经济衰退的担忧，再加上中东动荡加剧，使市场抛售情绪在周一开盘时爆发。 受伤最终的日本股市更为独特。过去一年半，美联储维持高利率，日本央行则没有跟着升息，而是按兵不动。 因此，日元对美元不断贬值，投资者借机进行大量的套息交易。即投资者以日元进行廉价借贷，以美元或欧元进行高收益投资，同时拿到利息差和投资收益，这种交易蓬勃发展，使日币进一步走低。 对于日本公司而言，也乐于见到这种情况，因为日本企业有大量投资在海外，赚取美元，在日本的财报则用日元结算，使其收益增加，国际投资者在过去一年涌入日本股市，推高市场。 图像来源， Getty Image 美国纽交所交易员 但是，上周日本央行意外加息，将政策利率上调了15个基点。此举让投资者担忧；随着日本加息，日元可能升值，那么规模巨大的套息交易可能难以为继。 本周一，在美国经济预期的低迷情绪下，叠加日本加息的影响，全球投资者开始进行“套利交易逆转”（unwind）的操作，即卖出美元、港币等高利率资产，买回日元。而此前因为利差导致对日企收益的乐观情绪也不复存在，抛售就此展开。 美国经济真的要衰退了吗？ 有这种担忧，来自上周五公布的美国就业数据，7月份创造了11.4万个就业岗位，远低于预期的17.5万个，失业率也升至 4.3%，创下近三年来的新高，这触发了一个被称为“萨姆法则”（Sahm rule）的经济学法则。 该法则以美国经济学家克劳迪娅·萨姆（Claudia Sahm）的名字命名，它指出，如果三个月的平均失业率比过去12个月的最低水平高出半个百分点，那么这个国家就处于经济衰退的初期。 由此测算，美国7月份的失业率有所上升，因此三个月的平均失业率为4.1%。而去年的最低水平为 3.5%，高出0.6%，符合“萨姆法则”中衰退初期的条件。 更令人担忧的是，美国联邦储备委员会上周投票决定不降息。而其他发达经济体的中央银行，包括英格兰银行和欧洲中央银行，最近都降低了利率。 美联储维持利率不变，但其主席鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）称，9 月份降息是可以考虑的。这一表态引起了市场担忧——美联储采取行动的等待期是否太长了。 降息意味着借贷的成本更低，这在理论上应该会对经济起到促进作用。但如果就业数据表明经济已经开始下滑，那么人们就会担心美联储即便降息也为时已晚。 除此之外，还有科技公司及其股价。科技公司的股价长期上涨，部分原因是对人工智能（AI）的乐观情绪。上周，芯片制造巨头英特尔宣布裁员15，000人。与此同时，市场传言称竞争对手英伟达（Nvidia）可能不得不推迟发布新的人工智能芯片。 随之而来的是科技重镇美国纳斯达克指数（Nasdaq）的血洗。纳斯达克指数在几周前创下高点后，周五暴跌 10%。 这助长了整个市场的恐惧因素，而这正是危险所在。如果股市恐慌持续，股价继续暴跌，美联储有可能在9月份的下次会议之前介入，并降低利率。 图像来源， Getty Image 美国马里兰州一个地产项目 凯投宏观（Capital Economics）首席经济学家尼尔·希林（Neil Shearing）认为，“如果市场失调加深并开始威胁到具有系统重要性的机构和/或更广泛的金融稳定”，这种情况就可能发生。 但也有些好消息。“萨姆法则”的提出者本人在周一告诉美国媒体，“我们现在并没有陷入衰退。” 她补充说，“经济衰退并非不可避免，还有很大的降息空间。” 其他人则对就业数据持模棱两可的态度。 “虽然报告很糟糕，但并没有那么糟糕。”希林认为，最近席卷美国的飓风贝里尔可能是造成 7 月份薪资数据疲软的原因之一。其他数据显示劳动力市场正在降温，但并未崩溃。 希林补充说：“解雇人数似乎没有增加。” 而 7 月份平均每周工作时间的小幅下降并不意味着经济衰退， 他说。",

    "description": "33 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 中国官方一封文件称，要实施“网证”，这可能意味着中国网民可能未来要持证上网；此文件一出，即便在信息管理严格的中文互联网上，也引起巨大的反响，包括清华大学教授在内的学者也质疑此举监管过度。 不过，学者和大量网民的反对意见很快在中文社交媒体微博上遭删除。 该文件名为《国家网络身份认证公共服务管理办法（征求意见稿）》，由中国公安部，以及中国政府实施网络监管的主要机构“国家网信办”两部门共同起草。 值得注意的是，虽然该征求意见稿明确，意见建议反馈截止日期为8月25日，但“国家网络身份认证试点版”App已在中国多个手机应用商店上线，用户已可以通过身份核验，获得一张带有“网号”的电子网络身份凭证。同时该App试点应用已涵盖10个政务APP和71个互联网APP，包括淘宝、微信和小红书。 征求意见稿解释，网号，是指与自然人身份信息一一对应，由字母和数字组成、不含身份信息的网络身份符号；网证，是指承载网号及自然人非明文身份信息的网络身份认证凭证。网号、网证可用于在互联网服务及有关部门、行业管理、服务中非明文登记、核验自然人真实身份信息。 征求意见稿说明称，基于国家网络身份认证公共服务，自然人在互联网服务中依法需要登记、核验真实身份信息时，可通过国家网络身份认证APP自愿申领并使用“网号”和“网证”进行非明文登记、核验，无需向互联网平台等提供明文个人身份信息。“由此，可以最大限度减少互联网平台以落实‘实名制’为由超范围采集、留存公民个人信息。” 简而言之，该文件称，通过该系统，用户只需通过政府推出的App进行身份核验，而不需要把关键的个人信息交给淘宝等互联网平台，从而可以减少互联网各平台超范围采集和留存公民的个人信息。 图像来源， PA 反对意见：越权之嫌 对于征求意见期还未过，就已经开始试行。有微博网友称，征询意见的期限还没到就急吼吼地实行了，那还征询什么意见，与政府自己制定的《行政管理法》的法律法规都相冲突。 对于此征求意见稿持反对意见者众多，其中最受关注的是清华大学法学教授劳东燕。她发帖分析称，指出了其中三个问题：缺乏“上位法”，架空“自愿原则”，越权之嫌。 劳东燕称，《办法》的核心意思是准备推行网号与网证制度，但这样的举措不仅蕴含极大的社会风险，而且完全缺乏上位法的依据。《办法》虽提到自愿原则，却未对自愿原则的实现提供基本保障，考虑到自愿原则在中国语境下易于被架空的现实，该原则同样难以为网证制度提供正当依据。她说，保护个人信息只是一种幌子，目的是让社会控制变得常规化和规范化。 “我认为，以部门规章的形式推出网证制度缺乏正当性，明显存在越权之嫌，有必要提交全国人大宪法与法律委员会对《办法》进行合宪性审查。”劳东燕称。 对于上述“自愿原则”被架空的可能，北京大学法学院教授沈岿也提出担忧称，通常在鼓励推广之下，统一“网号”“网证”的使用会越来越普遍、越来越广泛。甚至，不排除实行实名制的网络平台将来直接要求用户使用“网号”“网证”登记，而不给用户选择的机会。 一篇流传颇广但已被删除的评论文章《我担心哪天我的上网证被吊销了》称，“网证”变成了一种白名单制度，即凭证才能上网，被许可后才能上网；它的危险性在于，任何人被处罚或者监管后，可能会吊销“网证”，那么是否就剥夺了个人的上网权利，而且以疫情管控为例，中国监管往往层层加码，那么这种级别的监管，终将“祸国殃民”。 图像来源， Getty Images 官方辩解：减少信息泄露 征求意见稿中有三点设置，似乎为了减少可能的争议：自愿原则、“最小化和必要性原则”、减少信息泄露。 征求意见稿提出，鼓励互联网平台按照自愿原则接入公共服务，用以支持用户使用网号、网证登记、核验用户真实身份信息，依法履行个人信息保护和核验用户真实身份信息的义务。 “最小化和必要性原则”，即公共服务平台处理个人信息不得超出为自然人提供“网号”“网证”相关服务所必需的范围和限度。 减少信息泄露。对于用网号网证通过验证的用户，互联网平台不得要求用户另行提供明文身份信息，法律、行政法规另有规定或者用户同意提供的除外。 中国政法大学副教授朱巍对中国官媒称，国家推出了统一认证的机构、统一的信息存储平台，俗称eID的“网号”“网证”制度，也可以理解成每个人在互联网上也有身份证。在统一的“网证”制度下，单个平台无法获取用户个人信息，能大幅减少信息泄露的风险。在统一的身份认证制度下，对于电信诈骗者可以全网封禁其网证，杜绝其更换平台、手机号复活的机会，有利于打击电信诈骗。 另有自媒体发文辩解称，“为社会公众统一签发‘网号’和‘网证’，实际上不是为了管理公众，而是为了治理平台。以我们现在的网络建设水平，个人的上网痕迹信息，哪怕你是匿名的，其实也被记录、可追踪，网号、网证制度不会强化既有能力。我国实行电话卡实名制已经有十一年了，我们用任何软件都需要手机号注册才能发布内容和评论，发布什么违法言论是会被查到的。我们的个人信息早已被掌握，但只要你遵纪守法，谁会去查你呢？”",

    "title": "BBC专访朝鲜“脱北”外交官李日奎: 金正恩希望特朗普当选美国总统",

    "description": "珍妮·麦肯锡（Jean Mackenzie） BBC驻首尔记者 5 分钟前 图像来源， BBC / Hosu Lee 李日奎曾经是朝鲜驻古巴大使馆参赞，于去年11月带着妻儿投奔韩国，成为自2016年以来逃往韩国的最高级别外交官。 投奔韩国的前朝鲜外交官李日奎（Ri Il Kyu 音译）认为， 平壤希望特朗普（Donald Trump 川普）当选美国总统。 因为若他重新入主白宫，那将是朝鲜（北韩）“千载难逢的机会”。 这位有着独特地位并了解平壤的外交官曾经是朝鲜驻古巴大使馆参赞。它于去年11月带着妻儿投奔韩国，成为该国自2016年以来逃往韩国的最高级别外交官，最近接受了BBC的访问。 今年52岁的李日奎曾经七次面对面与金正恩会面。当他去年与家人从古巴逃亡到首尔时，李日奎接受采访。他当时坦承，自己在平壤第一次见到金正恩时“浑身发抖，紧张不安。” 但之后的每次会面中他发现金正恩总是“微笑，心情愉悦”。 “他常常称赞别人，还会大笑，看起来像是一个普通人！”李日奎告诉BBC。 不过，李日奎又强调称他毫无疑问地认为金正恩会不惜一切代价确保自己的生存，即使这意味着要他杀了2500万朝鲜人民：“他本可以成为一个好人和好爸爸。但将他塑造成神话却使他成为了一个怪物。” 在他首次接受国际广播媒体的采访中，李日奎罕有分享他的观察，以助人们了解到这个世界上最神秘和最专制的国家想要实现的目标。李日奎强调，尽管2019年金正恩与特朗普的会谈破裂，但朝鲜仍然视这位前美国总统为可以就核武器计划与平壤谈判的人物。 朝鲜外交官为何叛逃？经济困难可能是重要原因 普京访朝：中国才是普京与金正恩背后的真正力量 闯入传说中“不存在”的朝鲜地标 历史性会面：特朗普“三八线”握手金正恩 过去，特朗普曾称赞与金正恩的关系是其任期内的一项重要成就，并还曾出了名地表示他们“敬爱对方”并互相写信。就在上个月的一场集会上，特朗普对支持者称，金正恩“想念”他,并希望他重新入主白宫。 据此，李日奎表示平壤希望利用这一亲密的个人关系来谋取利益，虽然这与平壤上月发表的一份官方声明相矛盾。该声明称朝鲜“不在乎谁当选美国总统。” 他又对BBC特别提到，称这个拥核国家永不会放弃核武，并可能寻求达成一项协议以冻结其核计划作为换取美国解除制裁之条件。但他补充称平壤不会真诚地进行谈判，而平壤同意冻结其核计划“是一个诡计，百分之百的欺骗”，与平壤在核武谈判是一种“危险的做法”,只会“协助朝鲜更强”。 图像来源， Handout 2019年特朗普跨越三八线的历史性时刻 “生死赌注” 在叛逃8个月后，李日奎现在与家人一起生活在韩国。在韩国警察保镖和两名情报人员的陪同下，他解释了自己决定背弃平壤之原因。 他表示，在朝鲜多年的生活要面对腐败、贿赂和缺乏自由。最后的导火线是他的颈椎滑脱需要动手术，但申请后被拒绝了。“我在朝鲜享有顶层阶级1%的生活，但那仍比韩国中产阶级家庭的生活还要糟糕。” 作为朝鲜在古巴的外交官，李日奎说他每月只赚500美元，因此他非法在中国贩售古巴雪茄来维持家计。当他最初告诉妻子想要逃亡的念头时，妻子吓得心脏出现问题，进了医院。之后他只在飞机起飞前6小时告诉妻子和孩子他的逃亡计划。他形容这是一次“生死赌注”。 在朝鲜，被抓的脱北者，如果是平民通常会被审问数月后获释。但对于像他这样的精英人士来说只有两种结局：被关进政治犯集中营或枪决。“担忧和恐惧让人无法承受。我可以接受自己的死，但我无法承受家人被拖进劳改营的想法！”他说。 李日奎称，尽管他从未相信上帝，但在机场门口焦急等待时他还是开始祈祷。 2016年以来，平壤最有名的高级别叛逃者是太永浩（Tae Yong-ho），他曾是朝鲜助英国副大使，最近被任命为韩国总统顾问委员会下“统一事务委员会”的新任主席。 谈到朝鲜最近与俄罗斯的更紧密关系，李日奎又说，乌克兰战争对平壤而言是一种幸运。美国和首尔估计平壤已向莫斯科出售数百万发弹药以支援其入侵行动。作为交换，朝鲜获得了食品、燃料，甚至可能还有军事技术。他强调，这笔交易对平壤最主要的好处是能够继续发展其核武器。他还解释说，俄罗斯通过这笔交易制造了一个“漏洞”（loophole）使得金正恩能够“自由发展其核武器和导弹，加强其军事防御的同时无需向美国请求缓解制裁”。 图像来源， EPA 李日奎说乌克兰战争对平壤而言是一种幸运。美国和首尔估计平壤已向莫斯科出售数百万发弹药以支援其入侵行动。作为交换，朝鲜获得了食品、燃料甚至可能还有军事技术。 但他表示，事实上金正恩明白与莫斯科的这种关系是暂时的。乌克兰战争结束后，俄罗斯很可能会断绝这种关系。因此，金正恩并未放弃与美国正常化关系的计划。 “朝鲜明白其生存的唯一道路，亦即消除遭受入侵的威胁、发展经济的唯一方式就是与美国关系正常化。” 虽然俄罗斯可能协助朝鲜暂时缓解了经济痛苦。但李日奎表示，在新冠大流行期间完全封闭国境“严重破坏了该国的经济和人民生活。”当2023年边境重新开放，朝鲜外交官准备回国时，李先生称，家人们要求他们“带回任何和所有你拥有的东西，甚至是你的旧牙刷！因为朝鲜一无所有了。” 金正恩要求其公民绝对忠诚，哪怕是一丝丝反对的气息也可能导致入狱。 但他强调，多年的痛苦生活已经侵蚀了朝鲜人的忠诚。因为，现在没有人再指望从最高领导人金正恩那里得到任何东西：“对政权或金正恩的忠诚不再是真的。那是被迫的忠诚，因为要不是忠诚，就是面临死亡。” “最邪恶的行为” 朝鲜最近的变化，主要是由于大量走私进入朝鲜的韩国电影、电视剧和音乐。这在朝鲜是非法的。据此，李日奎表示“朝鲜人观看韩国文化内容不是因为有资本主义信仰，而只是试图在单调而灰暗的生活中打发时间。但随后人们会问：“为什么南方人过着第一世界国家的生活，而我们却生活在贫苦之中?” 你的器材不支持播放多媒体材料 脱北者讲述他们在朝鲜的生活 不过，李先生说，南韩文化产品正在改变朝鲜，但由于现有的控制系统，这些产品不可能导致朝鲜政权崩溃。“金正恩非常清楚，人民忠诚度正在下降，人们正在改变，这就是为什么他加强了恐怖统治的力度。” 平壤颁布了更严酷的法律用以惩罚那些消费和传播韩国文化商品的人。BBC去年采访了一名脱北者，他表示目睹有人因分享韩国音乐和电视节目而被处死。李日奎说，朝鲜去年年底放弃了数十年的最终与韩国统一的政策，这是进一步将朝鲜人民与韩国隔离的一次尝试。 李日奎将此描述为金正恩的“最邪恶的行为。”因为，所有朝鲜人都梦想着统一。他又向BBC解释说，,尽管过去的朝鲜领导人“偷走了人们的自由、金钱和人权”但金正恩却抢走了他们所剩不多的东西：希望。 在朝鲜之外，人们高度关注金正恩的健康状况。有人认为他可能过早去世，而这也许会导致政权的崩溃。 上一周，韩国情报机构估计金正恩的体重达140公斤，并面临心血管疾病的风险。但李日奎认为，朝鲜的监视和控制的系统已经建立得很牢固，以至于金正恩即便去世也不会危及这个专制政权。“会有另一个邪恶的领导者取代他的位置。” 还有人普遍猜测金正恩正在培养他年轻的女儿（据称名为金珠爱）作为他的继承人。但李先生驳斥了这种说法。他说，金氏家族用来证明其统治正当性是来自“神圣的白头山血统”，而且这被认为只能通过家族中的男性传承。因此，金珠爱缺乏成为朝鲜领导人的合法性和人气。他又说，起初人们对金珠爱很感兴趣，但现在已不再如此了。人民质疑她为什么要参加导弹试验而不是上学，为什么要穿奢侈的品牌服装而不是像其他孩子一样穿学校制服。 图像来源， Reuters 2019年特朗普与朝鲜领导人金正恩的历史性握手 李日奎认为，国际社会不应等待金正恩生病或死亡，而是要团结起来。包括朝鲜的盟友中国和俄罗斯“持续劝说平壤改变。” 他补充说这是唯一能结束朝鲜专制的方法。 最后，他说，希望他的叛逃能激励同伴，不是要他们也脱北，而是要他们从内部推动小的改变。他说，他并没有什么大的期望，比如朝鲜人能够投票或自由旅行。他只是希望人民能选择自己的工作，有足够的食物吃并能在朋友间自由地表达自己的言论。 不过，目前李日奎的优先事项是帮助家人适应在韩国的新生活，让孩子融入社会。 在采访结束时，他向我提出了一个假设情境说：“假如我提供你一个机会，如果成功我们会大赚一笔但失败就得死。你不会同意加入这个计划吧？这就是我强加在我妻儿身上的选择，而他们默默地同意并跟随我。” “这是一笔我必须终生偿还的债。” BBC韩语组权赫（Jake Kwon）和李浩水（Hosu Lee ）共同参与了此报导。",

    "description": "阿格尼娅（Aghnia Adzkia）, 武珍（Tran Vo） BBC国际部 56 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 自去年中柬“金龙”联合军演以来，柬埔寨的云壤海军基地迅速发展，并且有两艘疑似中国“江岛级”护卫舰的船只在此驻扎七个月，这引发了对该地区稳定的担忧。 根据BBC在军事专家的帮助下对BlackSky公司的实时卫星图像的分析，几乎整个190英亩的区域现在都被建筑物、道路和码头占据，仅有约8%的区域被树木或草地覆盖，而两年前这里绿色区域占了一半。 时任中国驻柬埔寨大使王文天在2022年6月举行的开工仪式上确认。中国“援助”了云壤海军基地升级改造项目。 中国官宣柬埔寨云壤海军基地“升级改造” 时间线与战略意义 两名军事专家对BBC称，卫星图片上两艘停靠在这里的护卫舰看起来像是中国护卫舰。 “它们是‘江岛级’护卫舰，长90米，最大宽度11、14米，”一位要求匿名的军事情报分析师对BBC表示。 自2023年12月至2024年6月，这两艘船只一直在此停泊，比战略与国际研究中心（CSIS）早些时候记录的5个月时间更长。 战略与国际研究中心东南亚项目主任格雷戈里·B·波林（Gregory B Poling）表示，云壤基地将裨益中方。 “云壤基地的雷达跟踪系统可以帮助中国人民解放军在马六甲海峡和印太地区的行动，”波林在接受BBC采访时说。 在冲突情况下，该基地可以支持燃料补给、弹药和部署。 专家表示，如果中国护卫舰在基地的隐秘访问和隐藏任务继续下去，可能会引发“灾难性失败”。 位于柬埔寨西南的云壤海军基地距离新加坡只有1000公里。该基地位于重要战略位置，它靠近泰国湾的入口以及柬埔寨政府计划建设的该国最大运河的深水港西哈努克市。该基地还靠近马六甲海峡——国际航运路线的咽喉要道。 图像来源， Getty Images 地理位置示意图 基地的迅速扩建 柬埔寨雲壤海軍基地2022年以來的變化 2022年6月18日 來源：BlackSky @-moz-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-moz-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-moz-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-webkit-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-ms-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-ms-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-ms-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes gel-spin{0%{transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.bbc-news-visual-journalism-loading-spinner{display:block;margin:8px auto;width:32px;height:32px;max-width:32px;fill:#323232;-webkit-animation-name:gel-spin;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-webkit-animation-timing-function:linear;-moz-animation-name:gel-spin;-moz-animation-duration:1s;-moz-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-moz-animation-timing-function:linear;animation-name:gel-spin;animation-duration:1s;animation-iteration-count:infinite;animation-timing-function:linear} ﻿.bbc-news-vj-wrapper{font-family:\"Heiti SC\", \"黑体\", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif} 根据BlackSky给BBC提供的卫星图像分析，从2022年6月到2024年6月，两年内这里已经建成了14座大型建筑、一座码头和一片填海区域。 随着建设速度的加快，专家们认为中国帮助了柬埔寨政府。 “如果没有中国在资金、物流和建筑专业知识方面的大力援助，柬埔寨政府不可能建成这些设施，”朱拉隆功大学政治学与国际关系教授提提南·蓬苏迪拉克（Thitinan Pongsudhirak）对BBC表示。 “云壤使柬埔寨更加靠近中国主导东南亚大陆的轨道。因此，云壤将使柬埔寨在东盟成员国中坚定地成为中国的座上宾。” 他还认为，云壤基地似乎“违反了柬埔寨宪法中关于禁止建立外国军事基地的规定”。 前美国海军军官、美国新安全中心高级研究员托马斯·H·舒加特三世（Thomas H. Shugart III）也持有同样的看法，他表示，中国给予了柬埔寨的海军基地全力支持。 托马斯对BBC说：“我认为这是中国建造的，因为这些建筑让我想起我在中国海外基地吉布提和东南亚人工岛上看到的建筑。以目前的建设速度和规模，柬埔寨没有足够的能力完成。” 托马斯指出，云壤西部新建码头看起来与中国人民解放军在非洲吉布提的保障基地码头相似。 中国人民解放军驻吉布提保障基地和柬埔寨云壤海军基地对比图 “关于基地的其余部分，据传，属于中国部分的规模也与中国人民解放军在吉布提的基地规模大致相当，”托马斯补充说。 观察：中国在吉布提设军事基地干什么？ 然而，托马斯指出，他没有足够的证据向中国政府证实他的分析，因为这些只是通过卫星图像得出的。 BBC已联系中国国防部、中国外交部和柬埔寨国防部进行评论，但尚未收到任何回复。 然而，在其它地方，中国和柬埔寨均否认云壤是中国专用的海军基地。 根据中国大使王文天在奠基仪式上的讲话，中国对云壤海军基地升级项目的援助“符合两国国内法律、相关国际法律和国际惯例，不针对任何第三方”。 “中国军队将继续向柬埔寨军队提供力所能及的援助，促进两国军事合作的不断推进，达到新的水平和新进展。” 柬埔寨当地媒体表示，允许外国长年在其领土上建立基地违反了柬埔寨宪法第53条。但柬埔寨前总理洪森和其长子、现任总理洪玛奈一直向当地媒体否认这一说法。 柬埔寨宪法第53条禁止外国在其领土上建立军事基地。 第55条还规定，条约或协议应保障柬埔寨的独立、主权、领土完整、中立性和国家统一。 BBC对基地的五个区域进行的观察发现：北部、中部、东部、东南部和南部每个区域都呈现出快速扩建的趋势 。 云壤基地新建筑群 在东部，从2022年6月到12月仅仅六个月的时间，柬埔寨政府清理了大约24英亩的土地，并开始堆放一些混凝土。一年后，已经建起了四栋大楼。 托马斯认为“这可能是营房（右边两栋）或行政建筑（左边两栋），中间有一个运动场，旁边的两栋直角形建筑似乎是停车场或车辆存储地/车库”。 2023年8月到12月期间，在同一区域他们还建造了四个油罐，然后在2024年4月底将它们涂成蓝色。 在基地的中部，他们从2023年3月开始建造一个新的码头，并于2023年10月完工。两个月后，上述两艘船只停靠在码头上，至少停留了七个月，直到2024年6月。 柬埔寨政府拆除了云壤海军基地北部的旧建筑 他们从东北部开始清理土地。自2022年6月以来的大约两年时间里，他们已经建起了四栋大楼、四栋小楼和一些未知设施。 从2024年2月到6月，柬方似乎在沿海地区拆除旧建筑，并计划建造其他建筑。他们还开辟一些新路径。 大规模整理土地并在云壤海军基地南面新建一座码头 2023年10月，他们在南部清理了一些土地，随后几个月进行了填海造地工作。一年后，混凝土被铺设在那里，一些驳船似乎在新建的码头处进行着什么工作。托马斯说：“可能是运送建筑材料或其他东西来回穿梭。”2024年6月，卫星图像显示出一个新的U形码头。 在东南部，一片清理过的土地上共建起了六栋建筑。随着建筑的扩建，新修的道路清晰可见。小楼扩建旁边还有一些小的单元。 “正在建造的东西与2019年 泄露给媒体的谅解备忘录 (MOU)显示了相似之处。借助中国的技术基础设施和工人，基地面积的三分之一将用于柬埔寨海军，基地北部的三分之二将留给中国独家使用，”波林说。 “他们希望我们关注基地的南部那三分之一，并忽略北部保留为中国独家使用的其余三分之二。” “中国军人可能驻扎在基地” 疑似中国军舰在该基地停留数月引发争议。波林告诉《日经新闻》称，有可能这些护卫舰搭载了士兵进行“轮换或长期驻扎”。 “这意味着在过去的五个月里可能有中国士兵驻扎在这个基地。” 上述匿名军事情报分析员告诉BBC，两艘中国江岛级护卫舰于2023年12月1日首次停靠在云壤，和亚洲自由电台（Radio Free Asia）报道的他们在2023年12月3日抵达参加军事联合演习比起来要更早两天。 2023年12月1日至2024年5月19日，这两艘护卫舰只离开云壤三次，它们总是成对移动，“在任何时候都不会有一艘船在场而另一艘不在”。 2024年6月12日，尽管中国和柬埔寨联合演习已于2024年5月底结束，这些军舰仍停留在那里。 “这些是江岛级护卫舰，长90米，最大宽度11.14米，”该分析员告诉BBC。 2023年12月初，柬埔寨国防部长在其 脸书帖子 上确认，这些船只帮助柬埔寨海军准备联合军事训练。然而，在5月的联合军演结束后，它们似乎待了更长时间。 江岛级护卫舰 根据《高棉时报》的 报道 ，早在2020年，即这些护卫舰出现之前，柬埔寨前总理洪森就有承诺，柬埔寨政府将允许所有军舰停靠新建的现代化海军云壤基地。 “关于对云壤基地的使用权，我想声明，我们欢迎来自所有国家的船只，包括美国、法国、加拿大、印度、英国、日本、澳大利亚，而不仅仅是中国，来港口停靠或与柬埔寨共同参加演习。声称柬埔寨已经授予中国50至90年独家使用权这一说法毫无根据。” 然而，就近期中国对该基地的独家使用权问题，值得注意的是根据《高棉时报》报道，2024年2月，两艘日本海上自卫队的驱逐舰在西哈努克港、而不是云壤基地的自主港口停靠了2天。 2023年12月到2024年6月雲壤基地出現中國江島級輕護衛艦 2023年12月1日 來源：BlackSky @-moz-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-moz-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-moz-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-webkit-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@-ms-keyframes gel-spin{0%{-ms-transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{-ms-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes gel-spin{0%{transform:rotate(0deg)}100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}.bbc-news-visual-journalism-loading-spinner{display:block;margin:8px auto;width:32px;height:32px;max-width:32px;fill:#323232;-webkit-animation-name:gel-spin;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-webkit-animation-timing-function:linear;-moz-animation-name:gel-spin;-moz-animation-duration:1s;-moz-animation-iteration-count:infinite;-moz-animation-timing-function:linear;animation-name:gel-spin;animation-duration:1s;animation-iteration-count:infinite;animation-timing-function:linear} ﻿.bbc-news-vj-wrapper{font-family:\"Heiti SC\", \"黑体\", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif} 为什么中国的存在对其他国家发出了警告？ 根据美国国防部丹尼尔·K·伊诺耶亚太安全研究中心（Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies of the US Department of Defense）的亚历山大·L·维文教授（Alexander L Vuving）的说法，通过在西部的云壤基地和东部的南沙群岛掌握双向通道，也就是在中国南部海域的纷争岛之间，中国可以完全控制一个非常广阔的区域，包括整个东南亚地区的中心。 “也就是说有了一个可以实时观测监控当下发生的所有事情的雷达，更别提还有一个基地来指挥船只和车辆来控制领空、海域或附近地区了。这也是一种可能性，”维文说。 中国解放军筹划打造“全球后勤补给网”令五角大楼担忧 中国一直在南海实施灰色地带战术——这是军事术语，指的是在战争和和平之间周旋的策略，在不实施武装力量的情况下实现在当地的利益最大化。 “南海冲突不符合中国的利益。如果发生南海冲突，美国可能会作为菲律宾的盟国介入，那么对中国来说事情将变得非常棘手。”维文补充道。 美国军队在菲律宾有外国军事基地。现在随着中国在云壤基地的存在，中国可以部署民兵、军力并拦截信息。 与此观点相同，东亚政治分析师、昆士兰大学讲师艾哈迈德·乌马尔（Ahmad Umar）表示，中国在该基地的存在可能激怒其它邻国。 “首先，中国可以干扰卫星传输消息，其次，这可能破坏该地区的稳定，无法和平解决南海冲突。这也可能引发灾难性后果，不仅威胁到地区的稳定，也威胁到中美关系甚至台湾冲突。”乌马尔告诉BBC。 乌马尔认为，中国决定不将云壤宣布为其海军基地是一种军事战略，目的是阻止美国在中台冲突爆发时支持台湾。 一种转变：从美国到中国 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion 在中国获得使用基地的权利很久以前，美国一直是柬埔寨军方的积极合作伙伴。自2010年以来，美国在军事设施的北部资助了两栋建筑，并与柬埔寨共同进行军事训练。 然而在2017年，就在两国联合协作的年度训练之前，柬埔寨突然宣布暂停这项已经持续多年的合作。 2019年，有关中国和柬埔寨关于云壤基地的协议文件被泄露给媒体，并被《华尔街日报》报道。根据文件，柬埔寨允许中国军队使用该基地北半部长达30年，并在此期满后自动续约。 2020年，日经亚洲报道称，一栋由美国资助的建筑被拆除，为中国的新建设让路。 2021年6月，美国副国务卿温迪·谢尔曼（Wendy Sherman）在访问柬埔寨时，他对中国军方的存在、美国资助建筑被强拆以及在云壤海军基地设施的情况表示高度担忧。 在美国政府网站上的一份声明中，谢尔曼表示，“中华人民共和国在柬埔寨设立军事基地将损害柬埔寨的主权，威胁地区安全，并对美柬关系产生负面影响。” 在会议之后，美国国防武官马库斯·M·费拉拉上校（Marcus M. Ferrara）被邀请到基地。然而，他没有完全访问权。对此，柬埔寨政府发言人菲·西潘（Phay Siphan）回应称，他们可以基于国家安全和领土完整的理由限制访问。 “问题在于柬埔寨的行动缺乏透明度。没有人知道哪些区域是为中国保留的，因为柬埔寨和中国都没有宣布。尽管柬埔寨方面总是说他们永远不会让外国在他们的国家建立军事基地，但关于这一点的真相是未知的，”维文在接受BBC采访时表示。 来自柬埔寨未来论坛的研究员安诚波（Chhengpor Aun）告诉BBC：“这种情况（柬埔寨承接外国海军基地）将需要柬埔寨宪法的改变，这可能会引起国内和国际的强烈反对。我不认为柬埔寨政府会冒这个风险，但我无法推测整个大背景下可能会存在的其他安排。” “如果成功升级和适当部署，云壤将在柬埔寨海军防御中发挥核心作用，以加强对泰国湾的海上主权，并为该国对海上安全日益积极的贡献提供支持。” 经过两年的快速发展，中国和柬埔寨一直在积极利用这一基地进行联合军事演习——在六个月内进行了两次。 根据柬埔寨国防部，最近的演习涉及2075名士兵和武器，包括来自柬埔寨的1315名士兵和中国武装部队的760名士兵。 中国和柬埔寨的关系越来越紧密。波林怀疑柬埔寨政府邀请中国到基地的隐藏议程是由腐败政府推动的。 “柬埔寨越来越倾向于中国这一现实源于柬埔寨人民党（CPP）领导的政权，现在洪玛奈基本上正在实行盗窃统治——他们正在寻找赞助商，需要资金来维持体系。如果资金耗尽，该党将崩溃，”波林对BBC说。 “中国是他们唯一可以赚钱的地方。只要中国继续向柬埔寨注入资金，不管洪森、洪玛奈喜欢与否，他们别无选择，只能继续成为北京的客户。” 然而，他补充道：“这并不意味着柬埔寨将永远被中国逼入困境。我认为柬埔寨人民越来越怀疑中国，并将中国视为腐败之源。” “因此，只有在洪森和洪玛奈掌权期间，这个网络才能生存下去。” 制图：Aghnia Adzkia, Andro Saini, Arvin Supriyadi and Ayu Idjaja",

    "description": "5 分钟前 图像来源， Peter Cziborra/REUTERS 中华台北队女拳手林郁婷 在巴黎奥运，女子拳击选手接连陷入性别争议风波，包括阿尔及利亚代表凯莉芙（Imane Khelif）及来自台湾的林郁婷。 她们去年曾遭国际拳击协会（IBA）取消资格，理由是未能通过性别测试，指她们有XY染色体。但国际奥委会（IOC）称，国际拳击协会作出相关决定时，没有任何正当程序。 国际奥委会主席巴赫（Thomas Bach）公開为两名选手辩护，呼吁停止仇恨言论。 “我们有两位拳击手，她们作为女性出生，作为女性成长，拥有女性护照，并作为女性参加了多年的比赛。”他説。“这就是女性的明确定义。她们作为女性的身份从未有过任何疑问。” 乔安娜·哈珀：运动员、科学家和致力保障女子体育的跨性别者 东京奥运：位于话题中心的跨性别举重选手哈伯德 巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间 赛场上发生什麽？ 28岁的台湾（以中华台北队名义参赛）拳击手林郁婷，周四（8月2日）在其首场奥运比赛中胜出。 她在欢呼声中进入赛场，并於女子57公斤级8强赛事赢了乌兹别克选手图尔迪别科娃（Sitora Turdibekova），现场传出一些嘘声。 图像来源， Ueslei Marcelino/REUTERS 这场赛事打满了三个回合，两人打完短暂握手，但在五名裁判一致判定林郁婷获胜后，她们没有再握手。 图尔迪贝科娃流泪离开赛场，没有停下来接受媒体采访，和她的团队迅速离开赛场。林郁婷则短暂停留，没有回答问题。 台湾媒体引述林郁婷的教练曾自强表示，希望林郁婷不要受外界打扰，不走进采访区，“外国媒体想问相关问题，她不知怎麽回答，有点吓到了”。 此前，阿尔及利亚选手凯莉芙（Imane Khelif）在女子66公斤16强赛事，赢了意大利选手卡里尼（Angela Carini）。 图像来源， YAHYA ARHAB/EPA-EFE 後者在比赛第46秒时宣布弃赛，她拒绝与对手握手，在赛场上跪地落泪，赛後表示“我必须保住自己的生命”。 但卡里尼翌日向对手道歉，称“如果国际奥委会说她可以比赛，我尊重这个决定”。 国际拳协与国际奥委会之争 这次性别风波背後，是国际拳击协会（IBA）与国际奥委会（IOC）之争。 去年3月，有俄罗斯背景的国际拳协在世界锦标赛称林郁婷和凯莉芙“不符合规则”，取消她们的资格。林郁婷的铜牌因此被剥夺。 国际拳协当时称，此举是“为了维护比赛的公平性和最高诚信度”。俄籍主席克里姆列夫（Umar Kremlev）对俄罗斯媒体表示，该会发现有关运动员有XY染色体。 但该判决引发外界质疑，国际拳协进行了“单独且公认的测试”，但一直没有说明是哪种测试，也没有让她们接受睾固酮素检查──睾固酮是男女都有的性激素，而成年男性的睾固酮水平约是成年女性的10到20倍。 到了去年6月，国际拳协因管理不善、贪污等指控，被国际奥委会取消其世界认可地位，奥运拳击赛事改为由国际奥委会自行主持。 不过，国际奥委会上周仍在其网站仍一度引述国际拳协对林郁婷的性别质疑，几天之后才删除相关内容。 上周初，国际奥委会在其媒体信息门户网站上表示，林未能通过“基于生化测试结果的资格要求”。该网站还提到：“这是自国际拳协开始使用新测试方法以来，首次有中华台北运动员被要求进行性别资格的生化测试。” 然而，国际奥委会在几天之后删除了这些信息。 国际奥委会在周四的一份声明中表示，凯莉芙和林成为了“国际拳协突如其来且武断决定的受害者”。 声明指出：“在2023年国际拳协世界锦标赛接近尾声时，他们在没有任何正当程序的情况下突然被取消资格。” “根据国际拳协网站上的会议记录，这一决定最初是由国际拳协秘书长和行政总裁单独做出的。国际拳协董事会仅在事后才批准了该决定，并随后要求在未来类似情况中制定和反映在国际拳协规章中的程序。记录还指出，国际拳协应该‘建立一个明确的性别测试程序’。 “对这两名运动员的当前攻击完全基于这一武断的决定，这一决定是在没有任何正当程序的情况下做出的，尤其是考虑到这些运动员已经参加高水平比赛多年。 “这种做法违反了良好治理原则。” 国际奥委会是根据运动员护照来定义性别。在争议声中，国际奥委会主席巴赫8月3日为两位拳手辩护，表示从没怀疑两人是女性。 图像来源， Carlos Perez Gallardo/REUTERS 巴赫说现在看到的是，有些人想要拥有女性的定义。“我只能请他们提出一个基于科学、新的女性定义。为什么一个出生、成长、参加比赛并拥有女性护照的人不能被视为女性？” 他强调国际奥委会愿意倾听，愿意调查，“但我们不会参与出于政治动机的文化战争”，又指社交媒体上一切“仇恨言论”和政治动机引发的辱骂完全不可接受。 一些台湾媒体去年报道称，林郁婷未通过测试是由于“体重控制和月经周期”药物影响了荷尔蒙水平。 “我男变女，喜欢女生，一点不柔弱”：专访香港罕有跨性别武术家 林郁婷是谁？ 28岁的林郁婷身高175厘米，至今取得40胜14负，曾三次获得世锦赛奖牌，两次获得亚洲冠军。 图像来源， Peter Cziborra/REUTERS 台湾媒体报道，林郁婷1995年出生於新北莺歌，小时候和哥哥一起观看日本知名拳击动漫《第一神拳》，主角幕之内一步本来是性格懦弱、受霸凌的高中生，後来转变成为职业拳王。林郁婷受啓发，从练田径转为练拳击。 而她的教练曾自强曾经透露， 林出身於家暴家庭，她希望保护母亲而学习拳击。 她留短头发、打扮中性，去年被国际拳协剥夺铜牌后曾形容，自己好像岳飞被冠上了莫须有罪名。 “我参与这个协会的比赛那麽多次，光世锦赛就七次，怎麽只有这次说我有问题。不能因为我的长相打扮不同於传统女性的样貌，就这样对我。他们也没有公布检测过程，直接给出一张纸就说结果不符合，这就是违反流程的事。” 凯莉芙是谁？ 25岁的凯莉芙身高178厘米，从2018年开始参加比赛，以9胜5负的战绩进入巴黎赛。 她上届在东京首次参加奥运会，在八强赛事中输给爱尔兰选手哈灵顿（Kellie Harrington），当时她并没有被质疑性别。 去年她进入新德里的世锦赛决赛，但开赛前一天被主办方取消资格。 图像来源， Ramzi Boudina/REUTERS 凯莉芙父亲 这次在巴黎奥运再被质疑性别，凯莉芙的父亲对天空新闻表示：“我的孩子是个女孩。” “她从小就被当作女孩养大。她是一个坚强的女孩。我教育她要勤奋勇敢。她有很强的工作和训练意志。” 他向路透社表示，女儿从六岁起就热爱体育运动，以女儿为荣，并展示凯莉芙的出生证明文件说：“这是我们家的官方文件，1999 年5月2日，伊曼-凯莉芙，女。这里写着，你可以看一下，这份文件不会说谎。”",

    "description": "李澄欣 BBC中文记者 30 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 江旻憓（左）的教练是罗马尼亚的塔维（右）。 香港剑击队在巴黎奥运三天内夺两金，30岁的江旻憓先反胜东道主法国选手在女子重剑（Épée）封后，紧跟着27岁的张家朗卫冕男子花剑（Foil）金牌，成为68年来该项目卫冕第一人。 根据国际剑击联会（FIE）最新排名，香港运动员占据两个单项排名世界第一——江旻憓以总分262分保持女子世界一姐地位，张家朗则以252分重返男子世界第一。 香港人口仅700多万，却能持续出现世界一流剑手，站稳世界顶尖队伍之位。圈内人士称，全港习剑人数保守估计多达2万人，主要来自大中小学校队以及香港剑击总会旗下近50间私人剑校。 BBC中文采访多名剑击队运动员、教练和学者，拆解香港剑击运动的崛起缘由，并回溯这项运动如何从殖民地贵族项目发展成为今天在中产阶级普及的运动。 香港奥运代表团历史佳绩和未能摆脱的政治阴影 香港赢得久违奥运金牌 张家朗获得男子花剑冠军 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间 东西合璧的训练体系 “她一定没问题的。”江旻憓决赛落后法国对手时，在电视直播节目以运动员身分当旁述的朱嘉望淡定地说。 图像来源， Getty Images 她没有说错，江旻憓最终逆转胜夺金。朱嘉望接受BBC中文访问时说：“我当时这么坚定地说，是因为我很相信Vivian（江旻憓）的实力。我看过她跟同一位对手打过很多次，每一次都是前段落后、后面追赢。” 29岁的朱嘉望是江旻憓的队友，上届东京奥运她们首次打入奥运女子剑击团体赛，两人都是香港体育学院（体院）的全职精英运动员，每周训练六天共25至30小时，上午炼体能，下午进行对打和技术训练。 该队以前由华人担任教练，2011年总教练郑兆康上任后大幅改革，聘请一批欧洲世界级教练，包括张家朗的法国人教练Gregory Koenig（Greg）和江旻憓的罗马尼亚教练Octavian-Petru Zidaru（Tavi）。郑兆康形容，十多年来打下的基础，现在是“收成期”，朱嘉望也表示这彻底改变了队内训练文化，给运动员全新的思维。 “Greg的风格是给运动员多一些放松时间，但一练习就很专注和高强度，这样才更加平衡，让人更加享受到练习和比赛。Tavi的风格也是不会把你逼得好紧，反而较讲究技术和细节。” 图像来源， Getty Images 张家朗的教练是法国人格雷各（Gregory Koenig，Greg） 她说教练团队也有来自香港本地、中国大陆和韩国的亚洲人，亚洲教练较重视基本功，因此港队成员都有“教科书水平”的标准手势和步法，打剑速度也非常快，在此基础上接受欧洲教练的训练就更上一层楼。 “不同国籍的教练互相配合很重要，以我们女子重剑为例，Tavi用欧洲模式做主，而中国教练姜海涛会配合他，他更了解亚洲人的身高、体型特性，知道如何把欧洲那一套改良和应用在我们身上。”朱嘉望对BBC中文说，“这样我们东西方的优点都兼备，而始终剑击是欧洲主导的运动，熟悉欧洲人的思维就更适合打欧洲对手。” 在巴黎卫冕金牌的张家朗也曾受访透露，法国教练格雷各加盟港队的第一法则是“你必须open-minded（思维开放）”，他要求运动员改掉“苦练就是好”的观念，鼓励他们了解自己而不是盲目遵守规矩，这启发了张家朗打剑时不只看招式的表面，还要思考每一个“为什么”。 图像来源， Moonie Chu 从左到右依次为中国教练姜海涛、江旻憓、余缮妡、陈渭泠、朱嘉望以及罗马尼亚教练Tavi 心态与海外经验 张家朗在决赛对战意大利的马基（Filippo Macchi），对方及其教练在整场赛事都被指十分“火爆”，失分时手舞喧叫及向裁判施压。“决一剑”时，双方曾两度刺中对方，裁判判定攻击无效，直到第三剑才判张家朗获胜，过程充满戏剧性。 而江旻憓决赛对阵东道主法国的剑手玛露比顿（Auriane Mallo-Breton）时，现场法国观众呐喊声沸腾，法国总统马克龙也亲自到场观战，她在巨大压力下初段落后，三个回合后追平并“决一剑”胜出。 图像来源， Getty Images 两人能在短时间内调整心态被视为致胜关键，没有受现场气氛或对手情绪干扰。对此，同为港队成员的朱嘉望认为，除了教练的启发，体院的运动心理中心也应记一功。 她说该院有数名心理学家，其中两位负责照顾剑击队，经常在训练期间观察运动员的心理状态，并会随队一同去亚锦赛、世锦赛、奥运等重要赛事。 “我们和他经常见，他很熟悉我们，我们也随时可以找他聊天，是他教会了我冥想，怎样在高压环境下把专注力放在当下，这些思想的练习对于比赛帮助很大。”朱嘉望说，“因为剑击好像下棋，不是斗体力，更多的是斗智、斗心、斗经验，心理质素是关键。” 另一方面，香港剑击队非常重视海外交流，运动员每年要到海外参加七、八个比赛，包括剑击世锦赛、亚锦赛和世界杯，教练会在赛事之间安排为期两周至一个月的海外集训，每年至少四次，让运动员适应时差和累积国际经验。 “所以我们经常去法国，每个剑击队成员都很熟悉巴黎。”朱嘉望笑道。 她说在海外集训也是跟着原有教练，但气氛会比平日更专注，也可以与各国对手切磋，并观摩其它国家教练的教法。“例如在去年世锦赛前的集训，一位日本教练带领了一个环节，教所有剑手脚法，我们学到以前从没学过的技巧。” 朱嘉望补充指，全世界的剑击队都有海外集训，是常态，但港队在这两届奥运前的预备时间里，明显投放了更多资源，“总教练安排给我们的集训多了很多，而成绩也反映出是值得的”。 殖民地时期的历史渊源 香港剑击队有今天的“收成期”，有赖过去几十年来播下的种子。而追溯剑击运动在香港的历史渊源，得回到港英时代。 图像来源， Getty Images 除了张家朗、江旻憓之外，香港还有年轻剑手崭露头角，例如19岁新星陈诺斯（前排右二）。 剑击是欧洲运动，香港作为前英国殖民地，二战前已有剑击爱好者，主要是洋人，一批葡藉剑手在二战期间移居澳门并接受前葡萄牙奥运选手训练，战后回流香港，其后在港的英军剑手也开始参与本地剑击活动，促成1949年成立香港业余剑击总会，并获加入英联邦剑击协会。 上世纪五十年代，这项运动慢慢打进华人精英阶层，喇沙、拔萃等由教会办学的传统名校陆续成立剑击校队，1960年举办第一届校际剑击比赛，带动其它名校的剑击风潮。 “英国人到海外拓展殖民地，都会把英国的运动文化输出去，包括剑击、足球、羽毛球等，而这些变成英联邦体育文化，香港受影响很深。”香港教育大学健康与体育学系高级讲师雷雄德博士对BBC中文说。 这些传统名校可说是香港第一代剑击运动员的摇篮，以剑击闻名的前财政司司长曾俊华，就是60年代初中就读喇沙书院时首次接触剑击。 他高中移居美国后继续学剑，大学时曾任麻省理工学院读书剑击队队长，80年代回港后到母校喇沙担任义务剑击教练，一教就是30年，不少港队现役剑手都曾是他的学生，包括曾出战上届东京奥运、目前世界排名第20的男子花剑运动员蔡俊彦。 时至今日，会剑击的小孩报读名校时仍可获加分，足见剑击在香港精英阶层的传统地位。 而剑击从上世纪六七十年代的名校小圈子运动，到八十年代逐渐普及化，转捩点也跟殖民地政策息息相关。 “二战前后，各国把体育纳入国家政策，关乎教育、生产力、军事训练和国家荣誉。但香港不是一个国家，殖民地政府也不重视体育，情况在六七暴动后改变。”雷雄德博士说。 1967年“六七暴动”后港英政府改变治港方针，引入多项社会改革，开始重视青年政策并注重体育发展，举办包含竞技比赛在内的“香港节”，1973年成立康乐体育局。 “政府认为年轻人太多‘剩余精力’无处发泄才会参与暴动，所以开始推广体育。英国政府在处理英国本土青年犯罪问题时也是这个思维。”雷雄德博士说，“在学术上，体育本身就有凝聚社会的功能，可以净化社会不安。” 两万剑手的城市 1982年，港英政府与赛马会合资在沙田成立银禧体育中心，即香港体育学院前身，负责培训精英运动员及推广体育活动，成立之初剑击已是九个重点项目之一，正式把剑击带到社区。 图像来源， Getty Images 雷雄德忆述，他上世纪八十年代初刚从师范学院体育系毕业，曾参加教育司署与银禧合办给体育教师的课程，进修冷门项目如剑击、独木舟、射击等。“教师学会了，带回一般的中小学，基层学生才接触到，造就年轻人有兴趣。现在的剑击总会高层当初也是这样学剑的。” 与此同时，银禧训练出一批精英剑击运动员，九十年代退役后成为教练人才，纷纷在民间开办私人剑击学校。 53岁的前剑击港队成员李永强就是其中一人，他1998年曾代表香港出战亚运会，退役后担任教练，2012年开办私人剑校香港剑击学院，见证着剑击社群壮大。“我30年前玩剑击，全香港才500多人，现在只是一个小学学界比赛已经有两三千人。” 他对BBC中文指出，以前剑击是贵族活动，但随着香港经济起飞、中产阶级崛起，可负担的家庭越来越多，小孩也越来越早开始学习，从中学阶段逐渐提前至小学、幼稚园，最早的甚至3岁就开始学。他说以中小学学界比赛分别有两三千人参加，加上幼儿、大专和成人，保守估计目前全港习剑人数多达2万人。 “张家朗也是这样出来，基层越多人玩、越早开始玩，我们选材基础就越扩大，选出来的精英就越强。体院集中训练精英，私人剑校负责基层推广，这30年来做了很好的分工，建立了整个系统——所以金牌不是突然冒出来的，是三代人的努力。” 新一代剑手 香港剑击运动的成就能否持续，要靠第四代人的努力。张家朗在巴黎奥运卫冕后受访时说，香港是个很小的城市，但“只要相信自己，不要因为（生于）一个很小的地方而放弃”。 图像来源， Getty Images 和他同代学剑的年轻教练贺扬则认为，正正是香港地方小，有很大优势，参加比赛很方便。 “外国地方大，小孩要去别的剑会比赛，可能要整个家庭一起出行、去好几天，但香港胜在够密集，一个尖沙咀已经有六七间剑校，就算去澳门或内地也很近，可以当天来回，这样我们的比赛经验相比其他国家的人更丰富。” 三年前东京奥运后的张家朗效应，让香港剑校如雨后春筍，目前香港剑击总会旗下属会有近50家。 贺扬也是在两年前创办剑校英汇剑击学院，他说他这一辈人棒做社区推广，开始革新教学模式，“不想像以前那种高压教育，把小孩逼得很紧，反而是营造快乐打剑的气氛”。他又认为新一代的剑校文化已经改变，更愿意互相合作，相信可吸引更多人投身剑击运动。 “我小时候学剑的体验很差，你愿意给钱他都未必肯教，就算教也是挤牙膏式，山头主义很严重。但我们这一代，成长于网络时代，所有资讯都很透明，更加愿意分享资源和合作，这样对整个剑击界都有好处。” 除了私人剑击学校，一般的中小学也对剑击持更开放态度。 本身是剑击教练的何莉恺在新界沙田区一家中学任教，她一年前在校内成立剑击队，目前有13人。她说当初向校长提出建议后，校方爽快答应。 图像来源， AFP “首先要多谢张家朗效应，让所有香港人认识了剑击。”她笑道。 “其次是用成本说服校长，其实剑击没有大家想像中那麽贵，教练费跟篮球队差不多，场地一个羽毛球场已经符合要求，只是买个裁判器，一般学校都可以承担。” 她补充指，自从国际剑联认可中国制造的服装和器材，市面上已有大量平价装备可供选择，投身剑击的门槛大大降低，现在背景较基层的南亚裔学生也积极参与，种族更多元化。 对此，学者雷雄德和前港队成员李永强都表示乐见，相信随着基层选手人数增多、种族更多元，香港剑击队将一代胜过一代。 “其实现在的学生，已经比张家朗小时候更厉害，以后的成绩非常令人期待。”李永强说。",

    "description": "12 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 拜登看着格什克维奇在抵达美国后给母亲一个大大的拥抱。 包括《华尔街日报》记者伊凡·格什科维奇（Evan Gershkovich）在内的三名美国人在与俄罗斯进行的囚犯交换协议中获释。美国囚犯都已安全返回美国领土。美国总统拜登（Joe Biden）和副总统卡马拉·哈里斯（kamala harris）亲自前往机场迎接他们，获释囚犯每个人都与家人拥抱。 32岁的格什科维奇是从俄罗斯监狱被交换的16名囚犯之一。俄国并接回了8名在美服刑的俄罗斯囚犯。 此次被称为冷战结束以来美俄两国最大规模的换囚行动。 这个在土耳其机场进行的换囚行动释放了前美国海军陆战队员保罗·惠伦（Paul Whelan）以及拥有俄美双重国籍的另一名记者阿尔苏·库尔马谢娃（Alsu Kurmasheva）。 在抵达马里兰州的美军安德鲁联合基地后，格什科维奇等三人从飞机上走下来，受到现场人员的热烈欢呼。 他们在机场跑道上停留拍照和交谈，不到一小时就离开了空军基地。拜登的车队也随后离开。 在他们返回美国之际，拜登在机场欢迎他们获释归来，并称“他们受的残酷折磨已经结束了”。 拜登在现场说：“想像一下，若你被不公平地扣押而你的孩子就在家里，你会有什么感受？” 他又补充称“想像在监狱里，不知何时才能回家。不知道孩子们的状况，他们晚上是否哭着入睡？每天你不在他们身边都是如何度过的？这些都很重要。” 拜登亦赞扬了美国盟友特别是德国和斯洛文尼亚所发挥的作用，并将格什科维奇等三人获释以及克里姆林宫批评人士弗拉基米尔·卡拉-穆尔扎（Vladimir Kara-Murza）的释放称为“外交成就”。 三名获释的美国公民将被送往德州的布鲁克陆军医院进行健康检查。 美伊完成换囚：美国解冻60亿美元伊朗资金，五名被押美公民飞离伊朗 美俄换囚 女篮明星与“死亡商人”各自获释返国 普京80年代的东德特工证件在德国曝光 澳大利亚华裔记者成蕾获释回国 曾遭“泄密”指控和判刑 图像来源， US Government 白宫发布的照片显示格什科维奇(左)、库尔马谢娃(右)和惠伦(右二)等人在从俄罗斯被囚中获释后登上飞机。 谈判历时18个月 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion 事实上，此次交换协议的谈判历时超过18个月。 关键在于莫斯科要求返还在德国服刑的俄国杀手瓦季姆·克拉西科夫（瓦迪姆·克拉西科夫）。他被指控曾在柏林市中心公园被毒杀流亡海外的前车臣叛军指挥官甘戈什维利（Zelimkhan Khangoshvili）。 克拉西科夫现已返回俄罗斯。 土耳其总统府则称，共有24名来自7个不同国家的囚犯在土耳其安卡拉交换，其中包括美国、德国、波兰、斯洛文尼亚、挪威、俄罗斯和白俄罗斯的囚犯。其中10人（包括2名未成年人）被遣返至俄罗斯，13名囚犯被送至德国，3人送抵美国。 在俄罗斯，普京在莫斯科机场亲自用花束迎接获释的俄罗斯人。他在红毯上热情地拥抱了他们，并表示他们将获得国家奖励。除了克拉西科夫，还有一对在斯洛维尼亚被判间谍罪的俄罗斯夫妇，他们和两个孩子一起返回俄罗斯。 北约和欧洲联盟都欢迎这次释放并称这是由土耳其斡旋达成的。德国公民李科·克里格尔（Rico Krieger）此前在白俄罗斯被判处死刑，但本周白俄罗斯领导人卢卡申科对他进行了赦免，他也已获释。 事实上，此前关于交换囚犯的讨论曾包括当时被监禁的俄罗斯反对派领袖阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexander Lukashenkoe）。但是当他在今年2月份于北极监狱以不明原因去世时，此交换方案濒临报废。他的遗孀尤利娅·纳瓦尔娜（Yulia Navalnaya）称此次换囚让她感到欣喜。 在换囚前几天就有消息传出各国即将进行的一次重大换囚。而且在此之前，数名在俄罗斯被监禁的异见人士和记者被从监狱转移到不明地点。尽管俄罗斯秘密转移囚犯较常见，但知名的囚犯大量失踪并不寻常。 过去最近一次高调换囚发生在2022年12月。当时美国篮球明星布兰妮·格莱纳（Brittney Griner）在阿布达比机场被交换回美国，莫斯科换回了在美监狱服刑12年的俄罗斯军火商维克多·布特（Viktor Bout）。 上一次类似的换囚发生在2010年的维也纳。当时10名在美国被捕的俄罗斯间谍与4名涉嫌在俄罗斯担任双重间谍的人交换。其中一人是前军事情报官员谢尔盖·斯克里帕尔（Sergei Skripa），他在2018年被毒杀于英格兰西南索尔兹伯里市（Salisbury）。 近年来莫斯科与西方的紧张局势不断升高，尤其是自2022年2月普京发动入侵乌克兰以来。 图像来源， Getty Images 2023 年 10 月在喀山被拘留的记者库尔马舍娃 (Alsu Kurmasheva) 在女儿们之间 分析：可能不会是最后一次 BBC俄罗斯事务编辑史蒂夫·罗森伯格（Steve Rosenberg） 这是自冷战以来最大规模的东西方囚犯交换。西方政府将欢迎国人获释，以及俄罗斯一些最著名的政治犯获得自由。莫斯科则将庆祝其特工的归来。 双方都会声称这是一笔好交易。 但如果俄罗斯像过去一样认定“人质外交”可行，令人担忧的是这种利用囚犯作为筹码的做法可能不会是最后一次。",

    "title": "巴黎奥运：为什么世界反兴奋剂机构感到被夹在中美之间",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-69236684",
    "description": "黄思琪（Kelly Ng） BBC记者 35 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Images 汤慕涵是征战巴黎奥运会的中国队31名游泳选手之一。 世界反兴奋剂机构（WADA）表示，由于中美两国的地缘政治紧张局势蔓延到奥运会舞台，该机构被“不公平地卷入”中美之间的争执中。 在遭遇一系列兴奋剂指控之后，中国的顶尖游泳运动员被置于聚光灯下，随后美国声称世界反兴奋剂机构掩盖此事，这引起了争议。 前往巴黎参赛的中国游泳运动员接受药检的次数是一些其他国家选手的两倍，这反过来又引发了对中国运动员受到阴谋干扰的指控。 世界反兴奋剂机构在周二的声明中说，它被卷入了“超级大国之间的地缘政治紧张局势，但却只能置身事外”。 “（美国）某些人纯粹是想通过这些涉事运动员是中国人来捞取政治筹码。”世界反兴奋剂机构媒体关系总监詹姆斯·菲茨杰拉德（James Fitzgerald）对BBC说。“结果是，这在反兴奋剂系统内部造成了不信任和分裂。” 贸易战、地缘政治对抗以及北京与俄罗斯的友好关系已经使中美这两大经济体的关系恶化。 在竞技体育中出现这样的紧张情势并不奇怪，但现在它们似乎正在引发一场更强硬和严厉的对立。 上周，世界反兴奋剂机构表示，它正在考虑就“诽谤性”指控对美国反兴奋剂机构（USADA）采取法律行动。 后者指责世界反兴奋剂机构和中国反兴奋剂中心（Chinada）是“掩盖阳性检测结果和压制勇敢举报人声音的黑手”之一。 美国议员也指责世界反兴奋剂机构未能妥善调查针对中国游泳运动员的兴奋剂指控。本周二，他们提出了一项法案，赋予白宫削减该机构资金的权力。 “当国会议员和参议员们把自己融入反兴奋剂这个技术性很强的领域时，这就不再是科学和法律分析的问题，而是滑向了政治领域。”菲茨杰拉德说。 受污染食品和营养补充剂 在世界反兴奋剂机构周二发表声明之前，《纽约时报》报道了一起此前未公开的案件，涉及两名中国游泳运动员，其中包括一名今年的奥运代表队成员，他们因涉嫌服用兴奋剂而受到调查。 他们在2022年被检测出体内一种禁用类固醇呈阳性，但他们被允许参加比赛。中国反兴奋剂中心的结论是，这两名运动员很可能是在食用受污染的汉堡时，在不知情的情况下摄入了类固醇。 美国反兴奋剂机构指责世界反兴奋剂机构让中国“在一套不同的规则下比赛，使赛场向他们倾斜”。 但世界反兴奋剂机构为这一说法进行了辩护。该机构称，运动员的营养补充剂和毛发检测结果均为阴性，两名游泳运动员在一次检测呈阳性前后几天提供的对照样本也均为阴性。 它补充说，这两名游泳运动员被禁赛一年多，然后便结案了。 该机构说，他们的案件是“涉及来自不同运动项目的（中国）运动员的一系列更广泛案例”的一部分，并补充称，“根据案例数量，显然在全球多个国家都存在污染问题”。 在6月的一份声明中，世界反兴奋剂机构指出，吃肉的运动员如果摄入了瘦肉精，有时会出现药检呈阳性的情况。瘦肉精是一种被禁用的物质，被用作家畜的生长促进剂。 在回答《纽约时报》的问题时，该机构表示正在调查中国以及墨西哥、危地马拉和其他国家的污染事件。 巴黎奥运2024：奖牌榜上哪个国家或地区领先？ 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 巴黎奥运会开幕式如何与众不同？这些是目前已知的要点 巴黎奥运：从性别平等、独特开幕式到俄罗斯运动员，你可能忽略的一些重要细节 图像来源， Getty Images 美国官员指责世界反兴奋剂机构“不公平地”偏袒中国游泳运动员。 巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？ 巴黎被指为奥运清理流浪者：“这对难民来说是一场噩梦” 该机构的负责人奥利维尔·尼格里（Olivier Niggli）当时指出，美国媒体“只问有关中国的问题，而肉类污染在许多国家都是个问题”，并提到“有人试图将反兴奋剂政治化”。 今年4月，《纽约时报》报道称，在2021年东京奥运会前几个月，23名中国游泳运动员在被检测是否服用提高成绩的药物时呈阳性，这掀起了轩然大波。 但在中国官员发现药检结果是由污染造成后，他们获准参赛。这支30人的队伍在东京奥运会上赢得了六枚奖牌，包括三枚金牌。其中11名药检呈阳性的运动员还被选入出征巴黎奥运会的中国游泳队。 美国游泳运动员、11枚奥运奖牌得主凯蒂·莱德基（Katie Ledecky）曾表示，在23名中国游泳运动员药检阳性的消息传出后，她对反兴奋剂监管机构的信心降到了“历史最低点”。 然而，世界反兴奋剂机构的调查发现，它“无法否认污染的可能性”是这种治疗心脏病的药物曲美他嗪（TMZ）的来源。 该机构表示，有鉴于受检运动员中，“曲美他嗪的浓度一直很低，且没有服用兴奋剂的模式”，这些因素都支持了污染的可能性。也就是说，运动员们几天的测试结果不一致，在阴性和阳性之间摇摆。 一项独立调查发现，世界反兴奋剂机构没有处理不当，也没有对中国游泳运动员表现出偏向性。 美中巨头间的冲突 这些丑闻加大了反兴奋剂官员的压力，当中国游泳队抵达巴黎时，他们接受的药检远远超过了标准。 据负责监管水上运动的世界泳联（World Aquatics）称，自今年1月以来，中国游泳队的31名队员平均每人接受了21次不同反兴奋剂组织的药检。 相比之下，澳大利亚的41名游泳运动员平均接受了4次药检，美国的46名游泳运动员平均接受了6次药检。 这一系列检测引发了另一系列指控。中国官方报纸《环球时报》指责西方大国“滥用兴奋剂检测扰乱中国游泳队”。 图像来源， Getty Images 张雨霏在100米蝶泳比赛中获得铜牌。 上海一位国际政治学教授在接受《环球时报》采访时，指责美国主导了反兴奋剂规则。 沈毅称，“苛刻和不道德的检测”扰乱了中国队的训练，并称这是“奥运会的耻辱”。 保持着男子200米蛙泳世界纪录的中国游泳选手覃海洋说，这些药检表明“近几年中国游泳队的成绩让欧美强队感受到了威胁”。 “一些小把戏意图扰乱我们的备战节奏，摧毁我们的心理防线。但我们不会惧怕。”他在中国社交媒体平台微博上说。 覃海洋曾在去年的世锦赛上夺得50米、100米和200米蛙泳金牌，他在周日的男子100米蛙泳决赛中获得第七名。 中国前跳水冠军高敏也提出了同样的批评。她说，苛刻的测试“干扰了我们中国游泳队”，并称覃海洋的表现是“这两年所有比赛中最差的一次”。 中国目前的奖牌总数为一金两银两铜。 中国的“蝶后”张雨霏在东京奥运会上获得了100米蝶泳银牌。在周一，她为自己获得铜牌而流泪，但表示兴奋剂检测对她没有太大影响。 她说，虽然兴奋剂检测是“有点烦躁”，但更多的是“远远大于”想象的压力。 梁艳婷（Annabelle Liang）补充报道。",

    "title": "上半年经济形势堪忧 中共政治局会议传递了哪些信息",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-69234753",
    "description": "21 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 去年下半年尤其是四季度，中国经济增长较快，使今年下半年达到较高增速难度加大。 7月30日举行中共政治局会议主题是“分析研究当前经济形势，部署下半年经济工作”，中共高层表示要“坚定不移完成全年经济社会发展目标任务”。 对于中国经济而言，亟待回答的问题是，能否完成“5%左右”的全年经济增长目标？ 今年一季度，中国经济增长势头不错，GDP增速5.3%；第二季度却大幅低于各机构预测，仅为4.7%，使得上半年整体经济增速为5%，与全年目标持平。 专家表示 ，今年下半年的基数效应将有所减弱，使得通往5%的道路充满挑战，如果要实现这一目标，可能需要看到进一步的政策支持。 GDP增速是基于去年同期经济数据计算的增长速率，去年下半年尤其是四季度，中国经济增长较快，使今年下半年达到较高增速难度加大。 分析指出，这次政治局会议传递出的四个发力方向能否兑现，还需要进一步观察。 中国到底有没有“产能过剩”？为何事关欧美？ 欧盟打了中国最疼爱的“孩子”：对华电动车关税落地 最高48.1% 二十届三中全会：300多项改革出台 2029年中国人的生活将是什么样？ 宏观政策：刺激可能加力 宏观政策，通常指各国政府通过“货币政策”或“财政政策”来调节经济，通俗而言，就是“印钱”和“撒钱”。 对比4月30日的政治局会议，对下阶段宏观政策的表述明显不同：上次会议称“要靠前发力有效落实已经确定的宏观政策”；这次会议称“宏观政策要持续用力、更加给力”、“要加强逆周期调节”、“加大宏观调控力度”等。 安邦智库分析称，上次会议到这次会议之间，中国的宏观政策均处于观望期。这是因为此前美国尚未传递出明显的降息信号，中国降息空间没有打开。 但这一形势发生了变化，一方面二季度经济增速低于预期，中国需要在下半年切实提振经济以完成全年增长目标；另一方面市场估计美联储最近几月可能降息。 安邦智库认为，会议字里行间的表述意味着下半年积极的财政政策将通过发行更多的国债和地方债来完成，而在“防风险”和“稳增长”之间，财政政策真正能够“加力”的空间，仍需要依靠发行特别国债等“国债财政”来实现。 “外部压力的增加，包括特朗普的潜在回归，凸显了刺激国内经济的紧迫性。”经济学人智库（EIU）首席中国经济学家苏月向BBC中文表示，假定其它因素保持不变，特朗普上台后如果中国对美出口额外增加 10%的关税，会使中国2025和2026年的GDP 增长率平均下降0.3-0.4个百分点。那么更果断的国内政策和财政扩张才可减轻部分影响。 图像来源， Getty Image 中国经济形势发生了变化，一方面二季度经济增速低于预期，需要在下半年切实提振经济以完成全年增长目标；另一方面市场估计美联储最近几月可能降息。 安抚民营企业 2020年底，习近平在一次企业家座谈会上提到“弘扬企业家精神”。但之后新冠疫情中实施的严厉封控，以及政府先后对对房地产、互联网、教培等行业的强力监管，让很多民营企业的日子不好过，信心严重受损。 今年7月15日的二十届三中全会的文件中再次出现“企业家精神”，本次政治局会议则试图强调民营企业的重要性： 比如，防止和纠正一些地方利用行政、刑事手段干预经济纠纷；要有力有效支持发展瞪羚企业、独角兽企业；要弘扬企业家精神，在改革创新和公平竞争中加快建设更多世界一流企业。 苏月解释称，会议特别关注民营企业、高增长企业和独角兽企业，并再次强调保护产权。会议没有过多提及国有企业，这表明下半年的重点将放在民营企业上。 “会议旨在通过提出切实可行的改革措施，解决以往政策执行不力的问题。会议还强调要遏制地方政府利用行政和刑事手段干预经济纠纷，完善市场机制。”苏月预计，这些政策方向将对信心产生“轻微的积极影响”。 首提防“内卷式”恶性竞争 图像来源， Getty Image 近期中国官方避免使用“产能过剩”一词，而防“内卷式恶性竞争”首次出现在政治局会议的通稿中。 “内卷式”恶性竞争首次出现在政治局会议的通稿中——“要强化行业自律”，“强化市场优胜劣汰机制，畅通落后低效产能退出渠道”。 近期中国官方避免使用“产能过剩”来形容这一问题。 苏月称，“内卷式”恶性竞争的提法可以理解为官方对产能过剩问题的回应，有助于缓解贸易压力。 在今年4月之前，对“产能过剩”的讨论和担忧，广泛存在于中国自己的官方语境和媒体舆论中。 比如，去年年底召开的中央经济工作会议指出，进一步推动经济回升向好需要克服一些困难和挑战，其中即包括“部分行业产能过剩”。今年3月的“两会”上，政府工作报告对此予以重申。 而上一次“产能过剩”出现在中央经济工作会议上，还是五年前。 2023年末，中国汽车制造、计算机通信电子、纺织业、食品制造业、医药制造业和电气机械等行业的产能利用率，甚至低于2016年末。 到今年4月，“产能过剩”突然成为中国对外贸易的热词——4日到9日，美国财长耶伦访华，点名了三个中国的产业产能过剩，可能会伤害美国；16日，德国总理朔尔茨访华，再提对“产能过剩”的关切。到了7月，欧盟对中国电动车加征额外的关税。 此后，中国避免使用“产能过剩”来描述供给侧的问题，而开始强调防“内卷式”恶性竞争。 “这与此前电池、光伏退出落后产能的相关政策一脉相承，也是从中央层面上明确定调要实施供给侧改革。”安邦智库表示，在当下的经济低迷期，需求萎缩造成产能过剩，很多行业出现了所谓的“内卷式”恶性竞争，例如新能源车、光伏、锂电池等。 “不过，实施供给侧改革政策的主要考量何在？‘内卷’行业如何自律？过剩的产能如何出清？是否会通过技术标准以行政手段强行关停一些项目？以及是否会在信贷上收紧来强制出清竞争力不足的企业？这一系列后续仍有待观察。” 图像来源， Getty Image 分析指，在当下的经济低迷期，需求萎缩造成产能过剩，很多行业出现了所谓的“内卷式”恶性竞争。 如何拉动消费 此次会议频繁提及增加收入、促进消费。 会议指出，“要以提振消费为重点扩大国内需求，经济政策的着力点要更多转向惠民生、促消费，要多渠道增加居民收入，增强中低收入群体的消费能力和意愿，把服务消费作为消费扩容升级的重要抓手，支持文旅、养老、育幼、家政等消费。” “中央政府非常重视保持扶贫成果，并将重点放在对低收入群体的转移支付上。”不过，苏月提醒，中等收入家庭的收入增长乏力与房地产行业的困境息息相关，这凸显了制定以家庭为重点的财政政策的必要性。 安邦智库注意到，促进消费的重点将放在以文旅、养老、育幼、家政为代表的服务消费上，实际上服务业在就业结构中占据了很大一部分，推动服务消费也可以解决就业的问题。 “但就多渠道增加居民收入而言，通过哪些渠道？如何才能让老百姓增加收入？这些并未提及。”安邦智库分析认为，在消费这个问题上，采取修修补补的设备更新和智能化改造措施是没问题的，但要真正拉动“消费—收入”的循环链条，还要回归到能否扭转市场对未来经济的预期上。",

    "description": "28 分钟前 图像来源， EPA 哈马斯高层则表示该组织陷入了震惊状态。 伊朗指责以色列周三（7月31日）在首都德黑兰暗杀了哈马斯领导人伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚（Ismail Haniyeh）， 并威胁对以色列实施“严厉惩罚”。以色列并未直接对哈尼亚的死发表评论。 然而，以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡则称，近日他的国家对敌人“迎头重击”，在黎巴嫩击毙一名黎巴嫩真主党高级指挥官。 他向色列民众表示“艰难日子即将到来”，因为中东局势正在升温，对于该区域爆发更大规模军事冲突的忧虑越来越高。“自贝鲁特行动以来， 我们听到各方的威胁，”内塔尼亚胡在电视讲话中表示。 “我们已做好准备应对任何情况，我们将团结一致、坚定不移，”他强调。 不过，联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯警告不要让局势“危险升级”。 哈尼亚被杀重创以巴停火前景。哈马斯武装部门表示，被广泛视为该组织政治领袖的哈尼亚遇刺将“战斗推向新的境界”并造成重大影响。哈马斯去年10月7日在以色列境内发动攻击造成约1200人丧生。 此后，以色列誓言摧毁哈马斯。 哈马斯称领导人哈尼亚在伊朗遇刺身亡 誓言进行报复 中国站在以色列与哈马斯面前的三个问题 一文看懂巴以冲突关键角色：哈马斯是谁？ 以巴冲突：揭开哈马斯高层人物的面纱 哈尼亚在曾在加沙停火谈判中扮演重要角色。他在周三出席伊朗新总统梅赫迪·巴哈达德·岛加德就职仪式后不久遇害。 一名哈马斯高官向BBC强调，哈尼亚此次遇刺地点是他此前访问伊朗时曾停留过的同一栋大楼。当时还有3名哈马斯领导人和数名警卫与他同在这栋楼内。 哈马斯高层哈利勒·阿勒-哈亚在记者会上引述一名目击者的话称，一枚导弹直接命中了哈尼亚。 哈尼亚从20世纪80年代末开始成为哈马斯的重要成员。作为位于卡塔尔的政治局主席，他负责与地区政府的联系，也是哈马斯与德黑兰及其在中东地区的代理人组织之间的核心人物。数月来，他一直是以色列当局通缉的目标。BBC了解到，因为安全考虑，他最近一次前往黎巴嫩的行程被他的保安小组否决。 但是他很少参与哈马斯的军事行动，因此可能感到自己比一些同伙更能公开行动。这也反映在自10月7日以色列遭遇袭击事件后，他曾有过三次前往伊朗的行程。 根据报导，在哈尼亚遇袭身亡之前，关于他的继任问题已开始浮现。根据哈马斯的宪法，政治局主席最多只能连任两届，新的候选人原定于2025年选出。 图像来源， EPA 哈尼亚周二出现在伊朗议会。周三（7月31日）出席伊朗新总统就职仪式后不久遇害。 哈尼亚的去世可能会加速该组织内部的权力角力。阿拉伯外交官普遍认为，与其他哈马斯高层相比，哈尼亚是一个较为务实的人物。他主导了哈马斯与区域政府的政治接触，而非偏向军事行动。这种战略与穆罕默德·代夫等领导人的取向不同，因为后者领导着哈马斯的军事部门。就在本月初以色列声称在加沙的空袭击中了代夫，但未能证实其是否遇难。 一名哈马斯官员告诉BBC：“哈马斯是一个理念，是一种意识形态。领导人的被杀并不会改变它，亦不会让哈马斯投降或让步。” 这似乎是试图淡化组织内部可能存在的紧张局势。 此外，就在哈尼亚遭杀害前几个小时，以色列称，其已在贝鲁特击毙黎巴嫩真主党高级指挥官福阿德·舒库尔（Fuad Shukur）。以色列认为，他策划了上周末对戈兰高地发动的火箭弹攻击，这次袭击造成12人死亡。但真主党否认参与其中。 但真主党的报复是很可能发生的。因为这个受伊朗支持，实力强大的组织过去曾在领导人被杀害后，向以色列发射大量火箭弹作为回应。 美国已更新了对公民的旅行指引，警告他们说，因为“局势紧张升高”，不要前往黎巴嫩。英国外交大臣也敦促本国公民离开黎巴嫩。一些国际航空公司业已取消了飞往贝鲁特之航班。预计联合航空、达美航空和英国航空也将宣布暂停飞往以色列特拉维夫的班机。 图像来源， WAEL HAMZEH/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock 一名哈马斯高官向BBC强调哈尼亚此次遇刺地点是他此前访问伊朗时曾停留过的同一栋大楼。 分析：以色列的豪赌 Skip podcast promotion and continue reading BBC 時事一周 Newsweek (Cantonese) BBC國際台粵語節目，重溫一周國際大事，兩岸四地消息，英國境況。並備有專題環節：〈記者來鴻〉、〈英國生活點滴〉和〈華人談天下〉。 分集 End of podcast promotion BBC国际事务编辑杰里米·鲍文（Jeremy Bowen） 以色列给予其敌人两次重创。 虽然以色列并未承认他们在德黑兰杀害了哈马斯政治领袖伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚，但很难想到还有谁能比以色列更想要他的命。 至于黎巴嫩真主党指挥官富阿德·舒克尔，以色列则表示他在贝鲁特遭到一次“基于情报的消除行动”中丧生。 对以色列而言，哈马斯内部任何大人物都是他们猎杀的目标。因为去年10月7日哈马斯的攻击造成了自1948年以来以色列最惨重的单日伤亡。 以色列表示，杀害舒克尔是因为这位资深的真主党指挥官，要为导致12名儿童和年轻人在以色列占领的戈兰高地丧生的火箭弹攻击负责。 真主党确认舒克尔在贝鲁特的突袭行动中丧命，但他们否认发动了在戈兰高地的攻击。 无论如何，中东再次充斥着自去年10月7日以来，即将到来的全面战争的恐怖猜测。而且，残酷且讽刺的一点在于双方都不希望爆发这场战争，但却越来越准备冒险。 以色列一直受到美国盟友的压力，要求他们对真主党的报复保持克制，并在不引发毁灭性报复和引发更大规模战争的情况下去打击真主党。 但这两次暗杀行动等同于一次巨大的赌博。 压力下，以色列希望对真主党造成打击但不引发毁灭性报复。但真主党领导人哈桑·纳斯鲁拉仍可能作出这样的决定：因为以色列对他们在贝鲁特南部的大本营发动攻击，真主党就应该对特拉维夫进行同样力度的回击。 以色列可能也已经评估过，在伊朗境内及层层保护下杀害了这名巴勒斯坦领导人，德黑兰也不会对其宣战。 哈尼亚刚会见了伊朗新任总统就丢了性命，这无疑是以色列战力的一次戏剧性展示。 伊朗伊斯兰共和国称，在今年4月对以色列发射数百枚导弹和无人机后已重建了抵御敌军的战力，但这一说法现已被证实是空洞的。当时发动的炮击是报复以色列之前空袭了位于大马士革的伊朗大使馆并杀害了2名伊朗将军。 现在看来伊朗、其盟友黎巴嫩真主党或其代理人很可能会再次进行报复。亲伊朗的伊拉克民兵已明确表示，针对暗杀事件，他们也指责并要求华盛顿负责。在红海地区，也许也会看到胡塞武装分子从也门（叶门）加大对以色列的攻击。 因为数月来来在加沙地带遭受以色列猛攻，哈马斯反击能力有限。而以色列对在其占领的西岸或在国内遭受攻击的可能性都有高度警惕。 众人必须认知到，中东地区已陷入了一场区域性战争，而且情况可能会变得更加糟。在这个世界上最动荡地区，战争的风险即严峻又清晰可见，我们很容易想像并构建各种战争情景。但即便如此，这一轮杀戮和报复也未必会引发全面战争。 一次又一次化解，无法减少全面战争的可能性。这也使得建立一条远离全面冲突威胁的外交途径变得更加困难。 如何降低中东致命高温？唯一有效的第一步就是加沙停火。",

    "description": "艾奥内·威尔斯（Ione Wells）&amp; 凡妮莎·布施施吕特（Vanessa Buschschlüter） BBC记者 发自加拉加斯和伦敦 11 分钟前 图像来源， Reuters 在南美国家委内瑞拉总统选举的争议“结果揭晓”后，首都加拉加斯街头爆发了新一轮的示威。 数千人聚集在委内瑞拉首都市中心，抗议现任总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicolas Maduro）宣称拿下胜利。 许多人认为，他们不会停止抗议，直到出现新政府。有些人还说，只有当国家安全部队加入反对派示威，新政府才会出现。 但是该国军队和警察到目前为止仍然忠诚于马杜罗，并开始对一些抗议者发射催泪瓦斯和橡胶子弹。 委内瑞拉地方官员称约有750人被逮捕。该国两家主要的非政府组织表示，至今已有数名民众死亡，数十人受伤。 周二（7月30日），委内瑞拉国防部长将抗议活动称为是一场“政变”。 被武装部队的保护下，弗拉基米尔·帕德里诺（Vladimir Padrino）将军宣读了一份声明称，马杜罗总统拥有军队的“绝对忠诚和无条件的支持。” 此外，马杜罗的亲密盟友、委内瑞拉检察长说，在反政府抗议活动中一名士兵已被杀害。 委内瑞拉：中俄印六大国选边站队各有考量 委内瑞拉危机：伊朗油轮与美国军舰或在海上对峙 中国向委内瑞拉再伸援手 习近平马杜罗各有所图 委内瑞拉危机：七张图帮你梳理头绪 图像来源， Getty Images 示威者向BBC强调他们发现大选舞弊证。 反对派领袖玛丽亚·科琳娜·马查多（Maria Corina Machado）呼吁抗议活动保持和平。她说：“我们必须以和平的方式行事。我们不应陷入政府设下的挑衅陷阱。他们想让委内瑞拉人彼此对抗。” “我们的候选人赢得了70%的选票。我们团结了一个国家，曾经相信马杜罗的委内瑞拉人今天过来与我们站在一起了。” 害怕遭到安全部队报复而不愿具名的一名示威者向BBC强调，他们发现了大选舞弊证据。 他说：“我们绝对确定选举被偷走了。我在投票站工作。政府不承认这一点，他们在半夜停止了所有投票计票。他们不想让世界知道他们输了。” 示威者又解释，过去支持前领导人查韦斯（Hugo Chavez）的委内瑞拉公民，即所谓的“查维斯主义者”（Chavistas）现正在收回对现任总统马杜罗的支持。 “这是一个非常和平的抗议活动。这是加拉加斯的富人区。但我们昨天看到的情况相当暴力。我相信以前是查维斯主义者的人现在已不再是了。”示威者说。 “我认为人们都希望有所改变。情况很可能会演变成暴力冲突。” 图像来源， Reuters 反对派领袖玛丽亚·科琳娜·马查多呼吁和平示威。 抗议活动在该国全国选举委员会（CNE）主席宣布马杜罗“成功连任”第三届总统任期后爆发。这位主席是马杜罗所属政党的成员，也曾是后者的法律顾问。 委内瑞拉全国选举委员会此前宣布马杜罗以51%的得票率当选，领先于反对派埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯 （Edmundo González）的44%。 但委内瑞拉选举机构至今未公布详细的投票统计数据。因此，反对派认为大选结果存在舞弊。 美洲国家组织（OAS）指责委内瑞拉政府完全扭曲了选举结果。支持贡萨雷斯的反对派联盟说，他们已经审查了73.2%的投票统计数据，坚持认为贡萨雷斯以很大优势胜出。 图像来源， Reuters 这些年来，近780万人逃离了在马杜罗政权下饱受经济和政治危机的母国 “我们有记录显示我们的胜利是绝对的，在数学上是无可逆转的胜利。”贡萨雷斯对外强调。然而本周委内瑞拉全国选举委员会仍宣称所有票数均已统计完毕，结果是现任总统胜出。 此外，长期支持马杜罗的检察长塔雷克·萨布（Tarek Saab）警告称，被捕者将被指控“颠覆政府”，并且在最严重的情况下将会涉嫌“恐怖主义”。 委内瑞拉反对党“人民意志”（Popular Will）强调，现在被拘留的包括该党的全国政治协调员佛莱迪·苏帕拉诺（Freddy Superlano）。 该党又警告称，执政党政府正加强力度镇压要求政府公布投票数据的人士。 图像来源， Reuters 马杜罗的支持者也走上街头，坚称他赢得了公平的胜利。 住在佩特雷市（Patera）的朱利奥·德比斯（Julio Derbis）向BBC强调：“我们将战斗下去。我们希望通过街头压力能够推翻总统想要继续掌权的企图。” “警察是我们的邻居。我们生活在一起，他们需要明白需要加入争取所有人共同利益的战斗。” 另一名示威者卡里娜·平托（Karina Pinto）向BBC解释此次抗议与之前的反政府示威不同。 她说：“我们必须走上街头，因为这是唯一的方式。我们不支持暴力，但政府很暴力。我们必须作出回应。 “安全部队必须站在我们这一边，他们也是委内瑞拉人。他们不能反对我们，因为我们跟她们一样都是人民。” 不过在该市内另一个区域，马杜罗总统的支持者也聚集在街头，坚称他公平获胜。 跳过 YouTube 帖子, 1 允许Google YouTube内容 此文包含Google YouTube提供的内容。由于这些内容会使用曲奇或小甜饼等科技，我们在加载任何内容前会寻求您的认可。 您可能在给与许可前愿意阅读Google YouTube 小甜饼政策 和 隐私政策 。 希望阅读上述内容，请点击“接受并继续”。 Accept and continue 告知：第三方内容可能包含广告 结尾 YouTube 帖子, 1 无内容 继续浏览 YouTube BBC对外部网站内容不负责任。 一名支持者南希·拉蒙斯（Nancy Ramones）说：“我没有在抗议任何事情，我在支持我的政府，就是那个获胜的政府。尼古拉斯·马杜罗总统。我支持他，因为他是代表和平的人。” “反对派说的那些都没有证据。如果他们说选举存在舞弊就必须证明。事实上没有发生任何舞弊。反对派总是有一些隐藏的政治目的。” “这是我们不会允许的政变，因为我们是爱国者。我们是委内瑞拉人，我们热爱和平。”拉蒙斯说。 另一位民众米拉格罗斯·亚罗查（Milagros Arocha）向BBC强调：“在这里，真正获胜的是尼古拉斯·马杜罗。这里是代表尼古拉斯·马杜罗的人。我们要和平。” 在普遍的不满情绪中，委内瑞拉反对党已经团结一致支持贡萨雷斯参选，试图在马杜罗执政11年之后推翻他的政府。 这些年来，近780万人逃离了在马杜罗政权下饱受经济和政治危机困扰的委内瑞拉。 联合国人权事务高级专员沃可·特尔克（Volker Turk）表示，他对委内瑞拉日益紧张和暴力的局势深感担忧。他呼吁当局尊重所有委内瑞拉人和平集会和抗议的权利。",

    "description": "彼得·鲍尔（Peter Ball）和劳拉·加西亚（Laura Garcia） BBC国际部记者，巴黎报道 14 分钟前 桥下走道上摆放着棱角分明的尖顶混凝土块。 2024年奥运会的目标不仅是一场体育盛会，也是主办城市巴黎的可持续发展和复兴。但该计划受到活动人士的质疑，他们声称当局一直在强迫脆弱的移民和无家可归者离开街道，并将他们驱散到法国各地。 在巴黎一座横跨运河的桥下，坐落着数十个巨大而棱角分明的尖顶混凝土块。 活动人士表示，这些石块的用途是在2024年奥运会期间，让流浪者和移民远离街头。 法律倡导组织“巴黎团结协会”（Paris Solidarity Bar）的奥莱丽亚·胡特（Aurelia Huot）说：“今天，街上再也没有人了。” “你可以看到桥下的这些石块。”她指着一片片混凝土块补充道。“警察会来巡逻，以免移民们回来重新搭建营地。” 巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？ 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 巴黎奥运2024：奖牌榜上哪个国家或地区领先？ 奥莱丽亚·胡特（Aurelia Huot）为法律倡导组织“巴黎团结协会”工作。 大约在奥运会开幕式前一周，一群流浪者从这里搬走。这是奥运会开幕前几个月当局清理的一长串据点和营地中最新的一处。 法雷斯·阿尔卡利·优素福（Faris Al Khali Youssouf）就是受影响者之一。他是一名来自乍得的移民，他和其他大约500人住在离奥运村只有几百米远的一栋建筑里，该建筑曾经属于一家混凝土工厂。 今年4月，防暴警察对这栋楼进行了清场，居民们被告知，他们将被安排在巴黎地区或数百公里外的图卢兹市暂住。 “你不得不说，这对难民来说简直就是一场噩梦。”法雷斯说。 “这是我们所有同胞目前都在经历的事情——他们在购买地铁票时被拦下，被截住并被转移到拘留中心。” 你的器材不支持播放多媒体材料 巴黎被指为奥运清理流浪者：“这对难民来说是一场噩梦” “难民正面临压力。” 从部署混凝土块的地方沿着运河步行几分钟后，活动人士保罗·阿劳兹（Paul Alauzy）在不同的桥下描述了另一次清场的过程。 “这里曾经有好几年都是帐篷城，有三年都有人在这里。”他指着人们曾经扎营的柱子之间的缝隙说。“到处都是帐篷，有时有100、200或300人。” 保罗为“奖牌的另一面”（Le Revers de la Médaille）组织工作。他称，在奥运会筹备期间，约有1.3万名移民离开了巴黎街头。 这是一项长期战略的一部分，活动人士认为，随着奥运会的临近，这项战略正在加速推进。 优素福表示，他在非洲国家乍得受到政治迫害后逃亡到法国。 当局已经为迁离街头的人们提供了住所，但这些住所往往是临时性的，而且远离巴黎，分布在法国各地的不同城市。 “当你把巴黎街头的人们送到很远的小城市时，他们就没有了同样的团结网络。”保罗说。 “当然，我们不希望人们呆在外面，我们希望他们有地方住。”他补充说。 “但如果你像这样驱散，而不提供长期的解决方案，你将永远无法解决问题。” 图像来源， Getty Images 巴黎警察清理了优素福曾经居住过的占屋区。 他说，在巴黎为移民群体开发的大型社区之外，人们很难获得所需的支持和医疗服务，最终只能搬回首都，重新流落街头。 在之前的奥运会上也有类似的抱怨。在东京，流浪者群体抱怨说，他们被迫离开曾经露宿的公园；在里约热内卢，整个贫民窟棚户区都被清空了。 然而，巴黎当局坚持认为，让人们离开街头是改善他们生活的关键。 图像来源， Getty Images 在奥运会筹备期间，巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）表示：“我也希望能解决为流浪者提供住房的问题”。 在奥运会筹备期间，巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）表示：“我也希望——这也是我们正在与国家讨论的议题之一——能解决为流浪者提供住房的问题”。 “据我所知，在现阶段，阻碍事情发展的是国家可以分配的财政资源。” 巴黎市政厅对BBC表示，“流浪者问题是奥运筹备工作的核心，在奥运会期间，巴黎市政厅将继续保持警惕，为弱势人群提供住宿。” 该部门还补充说：“巴黎市政府不会运用对流浪者有敌意的城市设施”。 该部门说，放置在桥下的混凝土块并不在巴黎市的土地上，而是属于邻近的卫星城欧贝维利耶（Aubervilliers）。欧贝维利耶市政当局表示，其正在使用“劝阻性”的街道设施，以防止“移民和吸毒者”回流。 活动人士保罗·阿劳齐讲述桥下移民营地如何被当局清理掉。 不过，许多活动人士仍对此深表担忧。 “对我来说，简而言之，这就是一场社会清理。”保罗说。 “你把人们赶出去，防止他们再回来，你只是把苦痛藏在地毯下，因为这只是短期的解决方案。”",

    "description": "25 分钟前 图像来源， Getty Image 本周一，习近平与梅洛尼在北京钓鱼台国宾馆举行了会谈。 7月27日至31日，意大利总理乔治亚·梅洛尼（Giorgia Meloni）对中国进行正式访问，访问期间，她会见了中国权力排名最高的三个领导人：国家主席习近平、总理李强、人大委员长赵乐际。 在会见习近平时她表示，中国是应对全球紧张局势的“重要对话者”；会见李强后，签署了一项加强经济合作的三年行动计划。 梅洛尼是意大利右翼政治家，2022年执政后退出习近平的标志性对外政策“一带一路”倡议，此前意大利是唯一加入该倡议的G7国家。 2022年11月，梅洛尼与习近平在巴厘岛G20峰会期间进行了双边会谈；此次是她上任后首次访华。梅洛尼称，此行为了“重启”意大利与中国的关系。 做了什么，说了什么 梅洛尼带着自己8岁的女儿抵达北京开启访华行程。 上周日她与中国国务院总理李强会面，梅洛尼表示，“我很高兴来这里展开本届政府的首次正式访问，在此之前，我们已经举行了数次高级别会议，这表明了我们开启新阶段的意愿，在我们全球战略伙伴关系建立20周年之际，重新启动我们的双边合作。” 会谈后，在梅洛尼和李强的见证下，中意两国签署三年行动计划，梅洛尼称其为“尝试新的合作形式”。 北京方面声明称，此举旨在增加两国在中小型企业在造船、航空航天、新能源、人工智能等领域的互利合作。 周日晚些时候，梅洛尼和李强出席了中意商业论坛，并在论坛上宣布了六项新协议，涉及电动汽车和可再生能源等不同领域。 梅洛尼在论坛上说，意大利与中国签署了一份工业合作备忘录，涉及电动汽车和可再生能源领域，这些是“中国已经运作了一段时间的前沿技术行业……（中国）正与合作伙伴分享新的前沿知识”。 一带一路：G7唯一参与国意大利正式退出 意大利大选极右翼政党获胜 有望诞生首位女总理 “一带一路”倡议十周年 改变世界的成败与未来 图像来源， Getty Image 两国领导人会谈。 本周一，梅洛尼在北京钓鱼台国宾馆与习近平会谈，她表示，“国际上不安全因素日益增多，我认为中国不可避免地成为应对所有这些情况的一个非常重要的对话者。 她说，两国必须 “共同思考”，以保持稳定和保障和平。 意大利总理办公室其后发布声明称，两国领导人讨论的问题包括乌克兰战争、中东局势进一步升级的风险以及印度洋-太平洋地区日益加剧的紧张局势，以及“从人工智能到应对气候变化和联合国安理会改革”等一些最重要的全球治理问题。 习近平则敦促罗马和北京“秉持丝绸之路精神”，使东西方关系“重回新时代”。 他说，“双方都面临着共同发展的重要机遇”，并补充说，“北京欢迎意大利企业来华投资，也愿意进口更多高质量的意大利产品”。 意大利通讯社（ANSA）报道称，习近平还表示中国有意与意大利探索在电动汽车和人工智能等新兴领域的合作。意大利是中国在欧盟的第四大贸易伙伴，该国因此仍热衷于寻求与北京建立强有力的经济关系。 在梅洛尼访问期间，两国还共同纪念意大利探险家马可·波罗逝世700周年。 值得一提的是，梅洛尼还在上述商业论坛上说：“中国在意大利的投资约为意大利在中国投资的三分之一。我希望以正确的方式缩小这一差距”。除了投资外，贸易也不平衡，去年双边贸易额达717.58亿美元，其中主要是中国对意大利的出口。 尴尬的前奏 梅洛尼访华过程中，中意双方在公开讲话和声明中，绝口不提“一带一路”倡议。只有习近平在会谈时表示，“中国和意大利分处古丝绸之路两端”，“弘扬丝路精神”，但未直接谈及中国雄心勃勃的“一带一路”倡议。 2019年，意大利成为第一个签署“一带一路”倡议的七国集团国家，这引起了美国和其他欧洲国家的担忧，认为这可能导致中国控制关键技术和基础设施。 然而，彼时在野的梅洛尼长期以来一直对“一带一路”倡议持批评态度，梅洛尼称其为 “一个大错误”。2022年梅洛尼上台，2023年12月正式通知中国政府将于年底退出该倡议。 投资银行“那提西银行”（Natixis）亚太区首席经济学家阿莉西亚·加西亚·埃雷罗（Alicia Garcia-Herrero）向媒体表示，“每个加入（一带一路倡议）的国家都知道，中国是第一位的，而他们是第二位的，我不认为意大利作为七国集团（G7）成员希望与俄罗斯、巴基斯坦或斯里兰卡被归为一类。” 她补充说：“如果没有‘一带一路倡议’（成员资格），梅洛尼与中国的接触就会处于不同的层次——不再是附庸，而是合作伙伴。” 不过，当时许多意大利公司担心中国政府可能会采取报复行动，影响它们在中国的投资或者与中国的贸易。 不仅如此，梅洛尼上台后还阻止一家中国国有企业控制轮胎制造巨头倍耐力（Pirelli）。 图像来源， Getty Images 中国的国有化工巨头中化集团是倍耐力的最大股东，持有这家拥有151年历史的米兰公司37%的股份。 去年六月，倍耐力在一份致投资者的声明中对外表示，意大利政府已裁定，只有倍耐力老板马尔科·特隆切蒂·普罗维拉（Marco Tronchetti Provera）控制的卡姆芬公司（Camfin）才能提名首席执行官候选人。 倍耐力还表示，政府已决定，该公司针对公司治理的任何变化都应接受官方审查。 在最近中国和欧盟的贸易摩擦中，意大利也支持欧盟委员会提高对中国进口电动车关税的决策。 早在2008年，梅洛尼作为已故总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼（Silvio Berlusconi）政府的青年部长，她曾敦促意大利运动员抵制2008年北京奥运会开幕式，以抗议中国的人权记录，尤其是在西藏的人权问题。 外界认为，这些都成为与中国改善关系过程中的阻碍。 重启之路 但中国有可能不计前嫌，跟意大利修补关系——路透社表示，意大利对中国具有重要的战略意义，因为该国以前曾独自与中国进行过合作，并可能成为欧盟、G7等集团内部一个对华温和的声音。 曾倡导罗马在2019年加入“一带一路”倡议的意大利前政府官员米歇尔·杰拉奇（Michele Geraci）说，中国政府可能也会渴望摆脱最近的挫折。 “中国的目标是假装一切顺利，&quot;他说。“他们对强调意大利退出‘一带一路’倡议并无太大兴趣。他们不喜欢这样，不喜欢大惊小怪。” 图像来源， Getty Image 中意两国国旗 梅洛尼的公开发言似乎表明，意大利也有意向中国靠拢，并成为中国在欧盟中的朋友之一。梅洛尼称，“我认为，意大利也可以在（中国）与欧盟的关系中发挥重要作用，并在此尝试建立尽可能平衡的贸易关系。” 路透社表示，虽然意大利去年迫于美国压力最终退出“一带一路”，但罗马在周日签署了一项为期三年的行动计划，表明它仍希望与这个亚洲巨人建立更牢固的贸易关系。 中国国际问题研究院欧洲研究所所长崔洪建说，面对地缘政治的不确定性，包括美国大选带来的不确定性，中国的首要任务是稳定两国关系。中方告诉意方“我们需要在两国关系中增加一些韧性”。 但这并不意味着重启关系之路会一帆风顺。梅洛尼本人一直对中国持警惕态度，对中国的人权问题直言不讳，还指责中国的不公平贸易行为，并警告欧洲在战略供应链中过度依赖中国公司可能带来风险。 即便是气氛颇为友好的访华之旅期间，她在上述商业论坛上，对企业高管们说，“显然，我们不能掩盖严重失衡的问题，这对意大利来说是一个重要的逆差”，并提到了改善中国市场准入和加强知识产权保护的必要性。 李强在会面时也表示，“希望欧盟客观看待中国的发展......深化对话与合作”，“保护主义无法保护竞争力”。",

    "title": "巴黎奥运：在塞纳河里游泳有什么问题？这能成为奥运遗产吗？",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/sports-69230112",
    "description": "詹姆斯·菲茨杰拉德（James FitzGerald） 巴黎报道 1 小时前 图像来源， EPA 这本该是2024年巴黎奥运会的一大亮点：铁人三项运动员在塞纳河中竞逐，让游泳回归巴黎市中心。但出于对水质的担忧，首场比赛不得不推迟一天进行。 我们来到原计划起点稍下游的荣军院桥（Pont des Invalides）上，当地人和游客向我谈起他们是否想亲自下水游泳。 巴黎奥运截至目前引发的三大争议 不限于开幕式的尺度 参赛但不会登上奖牌榜，俄罗斯人如何参加巴黎奥运 巴黎时隔百年再办奥运会 你可能忽略的一些重要细节 “这是一条美丽的河流。”在七月的炎热日子里，巴黎人赫达（Reda）看着塞纳河波光粼粼的水面说道。 “但我永远不会潜入水中，即便他们清理了很多年。” 塞纳河已经在本届奥运会中成为主角。在上周五晚淅淅沥沥的雨中举行的开幕式上，塞纳河接待了数以千计参加游船巡游的运动员。 一个世纪以来，由于水质问题，当局一直禁止市民在塞纳河中游泳。但通过一项大型改造项目，在塞纳河里畅游将成为本届奥运会的重要遗产之一。 就在本周一，组织者还表示他们有信心铁人三项比赛将按计划进行。但周末的大雨使这一计划落空。 巴黎的“单一系统”排水设施已经饱和，来自厨房、厕所和街道上的雨水等额外水源被排入河中。 巴黎人赫达说自己永远不会潜入塞纳河水中。 巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈（Anne Hidalgo）最近在塞纳河中游泳，以强调为清洁塞纳河所做的努力。 此前的检测结果显示，塞纳河中的大肠杆菌水平超过了体育协会规定的上限。这种细菌可导致呕吐和腹泻等疾病。 BBC记者休·肖菲尔德（Hugh Schofield）当时也加入了伊达尔戈的行列。他不小心吞下一口河水，但他说水的味道还不错。 我在荣军院桥上与许多游客交谈时，他们都说在本国露天水域游泳并非难事。 来自英国、德国、荷兰和捷克的游客都表示，他们曾在本国的河流、湖泊和运河中游泳，如果有证据表明塞纳河是安全的，他们也会这么做。 埃斯米（右）表示，这条河看上去“没有那么糟糕”。 “我愿意试试。”来自荷兰的女士埃斯米（Esmee）说，“从这里看并没有那么糟糕。” 法国在优质浴场水质方面落后于欧盟平均水平。根据欧洲环境署（European Environment Agency）的数据，2023年约有75%的法国浴场水质被评为优，而整个欧盟的这一比例为85%。 该机构在今年5月发布的报告中指出，虽然在欧盟的大多数浴场游泳都是安全的，但沿海水域的游泳条件普遍优于河流和湖泊。 塞浦路斯以97.6%的浴场水质优良率位居榜首，其次是奥地利的96.9%和克罗地亚的96.7%。 由于该数据只针对欧盟国家，因此不包括英国。尽管塞纳河已开始允许游泳，但目前英国只有泰晤士河的一个河段——牛津郡瓦灵福德附近——被指定为游泳场所。 欧洲环境署特别提到了巴黎10年前开始的耗资14亿欧元（11亿英镑；15 亿美元）的清理行动。 作为这项行动的一部分，巴黎建造了一个巨大的雨水蓄集池。它可以储存相当于20个奥林匹克游泳池的水量。这是阻止污水在暴雨期间流入塞纳河的机制的一部分。 丹妮勒表示，她期待着在这条著名的河流中畅游。 在男子铁人三项比赛前夕，并非所有来到大桥的游客都对清洁问题感到困扰。一些人表示，只要天气足够暖和，无论如何他们都会考虑跳进河里。 一位来自巴西的男子说，他和他的同胞就是这么做的。他承认：“在我的城市圣保罗，河水也不干净。” 但许多巴黎人都认为，一条干净、适于游泳的河流将成为奥运遗产中令人兴奋的一部分。 大学教授丹妮勒（Danielle）说，她“绝对会”在塞纳河中游泳。 “我早就想这么做了。”她笑着说。 对于一个名叫达米安（Damien）的男子来说，保持塞纳河的清洁是一项“大工程”，但值得一做。 “这对所有巴黎人来说都是一个好机会。”他说。 目前，塞纳河的水质每天都会被进行检测。 2024年巴黎奥运会运营总监兰比斯·康斯坦丁尼蒂斯（Lambis Konstantinidis）说，目前有若干备用计划，包括使用补赛日。 他在星期一对BBC说，只有在“非常、非常极端的情况下”，才会考虑将铁人三项赛降级为铁人二项，并完全取消游泳比赛。 劳伦·特纳（Lauren Turner）补充报道",

Directed by Walter Salles and starring Fernanda Torres, I’m Still Here is a political drama based on the true story of Eunice Paiva, whose husband Rubens was “disappeared” and murdered in 1970s Brazil. The film had to overcome a lineup including Danish true-crime story The Girl With the Needle , Iran-set legal drama The Seed of the Sacred Fig and trans gangster musical Emilia Pérez , which had been the hot favourite for the award.

After the shocking treatment he received at the White House on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was on friendlier turf yesterday – but whether a bear hug from Keir Starmer and an audience with King Charles will ultimately prove consequential for the war in Ukraine is still anyone’s guess. The Ukrainian president was in the UK to attend a European summit , convened by Starmer, to take steps towards new proposals that might be able to find support in Kyiv and Washington alike. And while there were some signs of European unity, the White House and its surrogates were still suggesting that Zelenskyy was guilty of some sort of insult to the United States that might be enough to make a durable peace impossible. Last night, Zelenskyy refused to say whether he believed he had been ambushed – but said that he was ready to talk to Trump again.

    "description": "Lenovo is showing business laptops lovers some attention by announcing several new ThinkPads at Mobile World Congress 2025, including a new form factor for the T-series line, and updated internals across the business laptop lineup. The ThinkPad T14s 2-in-1 is by far the most interesting of the bunch, with a new convertible body that's similar to Lenovo's Yoga laptops , and supports the magnetic Yoga Pen stylus. The laptop comes with up to a 14-inch, 400-nit WUXGA touch display, and inside, you can get up to a Intel Core Ultra 7 H or U 200 series chip, 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM and 1TB of storage. If you're looking for an option without a 360-degree hinge, the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 and ThinkPad T14 Gen 6 will also now come with either Intel Core Ultra or AMD Ryzen AI Pro chips, up to 32GB of RAM and up to 2TB of storage. Lenovo Lenovo describes the new ThinkPad X13 Gen 6 as \"one of the lightest ThinkPad designs ever,\" at only 2.05 lbs, but that light weight doesn't mean the laptop misses out on the latest internals. The X13 Gen 6 comes with either a Intel Core Ultra or AMD Ryzen AI Pro chip, up to 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM and your choice of a 41Wh or 54.7Wh battery. The new ThinkPad can also support Wi-Fi 7 and an optional 5G connection, if you want to take it on the go.&nbsp; Chip updates round out the remaining ThinkPads, with the ThinkPad E14 Gen 7 and E16 Gen 3 gaining support for up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 U or H 200 series chip and up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM, while the ThinkPad T16 Gen 4 is caps out at 32GB of RAM. Lenovo is making the majority of its new ThinkPads available this summer, with the ThinkPad T14s 2-in-1, ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 and ThinkPad X13 Gen 6 arriving in June 2025 for $1,719, $1,674 and $1,139, respectively. The ThinkPad T14 Gen 6 and ThinkPad T16 Gen 4 are launching a little earlier in May for $1,359 and $1,623. And rounding things out, the ThinkPad E14 Gen 7 and E16 Gen 3 are coming in \"Q2 2025\" for $849 and $859.

    "description": "Lenovo hasn’t even released its futuristic laptop with a rollable screen . But that hasn’t stopped the company from taking that notebook’s core components and remixing it into a whole new thing at MWC 2025. Officially called the ThinkBook codename Flip AI PC Proof of concept (yes, that is its official name and it’s a real mouthful), the laptop uses the same flexible OLED featured in its rollable sibling, except this time instead of disappearing inside its chassis, the display folds outwards. This allows what is normally a 13-inch panel to double in size to 18.1 inches at a moment's notice. Notably, because the Flip’s screen bends instead of sliding in and out of the bottom half of the system, Lenovo can utilize the panel’s full area unlike the ThinkBook Rollable, which can only extend up to 16.7 inches. In its vertical mode, this provides a ton of extra space for documents or multitasking. However, the screen can also be folded back into tablet mode or something akin to a 2-in-1’s tent mode for times when you might want to share your display with someone on the other side of the table. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Somewhat impressively, a fancy monitor isn’t the only trick the Flip has. Down below, Lenovo created what it calls a Smart ForcePad, which features a three-layer illuminated dashboard that adds customizable controls and icons to its surface. It’s a neat trick that expands what a basic touchpad can do, though it’s not exactly a huge leap from what we’ve seen on rival machines from Acer and others. Finally, on the inside, the Flip should have solid performance thanks to the inclusion of an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of RAM and PCIe SSD storage. As a fan of anything with a flexible screen, it’s fascinating to see how quickly Lenovo was able to take the components used in the ThinkBook Plus Gen6 Rollable and turn them into something else. That said, as this was a very early prototype (a Lenovo representative said it was only one of two in the world at the time), there are some obvious issues that need to be ironed out before this thing ever gets close to an official release. The first is that for a system with a screen this tall, its hinge wasn’t fully up to the task of keeping everything stable, as even a light tap would cause the whole panel to sway back and forth in a disconcerting way. The model I used also lacked that kickstand that appears in some of Lenovo’s promotional images, which would have further increased its sturdiness. However, the biggest potential problem with the Flip may be difficult to address because it’s inherent to its core design. When the laptop is collapsed down into a clamshell for traveling, the way its screen folds exposes the flexible display to items that might scratch it. And while it’s possible to get around this by using a form-fitting laptop sleeve, that seems a bit too dangerous, even for someone like me who’s been using foldable phones for half a decade. Upon further consideration, I wouldn’t be surprised if this design challenge is a big reason Lenovo decided to bring the ThinkBook Rollable to market instead of the Flip. Currently, Lenovo has no plans to bring the Flip to full production, but even so, it’s nice seeing what a company can come up with when it's not scared to show off unfinished devices.

    "description": "Lenovo has announced new laptops with generative AI features for this year&#39;s Mobile World Congress (MWC), including the Yoga Pro 9i Aura edition. Lenovo&#39;s Aura edition branding is the result of a partnership with Intel to create a set of &quot;distinct software, hardware and AI features&quot; that make &quot;computing a more personalized, productive, and protected experience.&quot; The Yoga Pro 9i Aura edition is powered by the Intel Core Ultra processor and ships with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, which is the company&#39;s most affordable model in the RTX 50 series . It has a 16-inch 3.2K PureSight Pro display with a double layer of OLED pixels that increases its overall brightness to 1600nits peak, as well as boosts its power efficiency. The display also supports 100 percent sRGB, P3 and Adobe RGB color gamut that provide true-to-life color accuracy. Like the previous versions of the Yoga Pro 9i , the Aura edition comes with the Lenovo Creator Zone, an on-device AI suite that can make third-party video, photo and music applications for creators easier to use. Lenovo&#39;s Yoga Pro 9i Aura Edition will be available starting in the second quarter of 2025, with prices starting at $1,799. The company has also introduced the 15-inch IdeaPad Slim 3x, a Copilot+ PC that runs on Snapdragon X chip, Qualcomm&#39;s new platform designed to put Copilot+ PCs within reach for more people. IdeaPad Slim 3x can also process AI tasks on device and comes with a dedicated key for Microsoft&#39;s Copilot assistant. One more interesting feature is the device&#39;s open SSD slot that can fit an extra SSD for those who want to expand the laptop&#39;s storage capacity. The model will be available starting this month for at least $649.

    "description": "You might be surprised to learn that the first laptop with built-in solar panels is nearly 15 years old. But to me, the bigger shock is that with all the recent advancements in photovoltaic cells, manufacturers haven’t revisited this idea more often. But at MWC 2025, Lenovo is changing that with its Yoga Solar PC Concept. Weighing 2.6 pounds and measuring less than 0.6 inches thick, the Yoga Solar PC Concept is essentially the same size as a standard 14-inch clamshell. And because its underlying design isn’t all that different from Lenovo’s standard Yoga family, it doesn’t skimp on specs either. It features an OLED display, up to 32GB of RAM, a decent-sized 50.2 WHr battery and even a 2MP IR webcam for use with Windows Hello. However, all those components aren’t nearly as important as the solar cells embedded in its lid. Lenovo says the panels use Back Contact Cell technology so that its mounting brackets and gridlines can be placed on the rear of the cells. This allows the panels to offer up to 24 percent solar energy conversion, which is pretty good as that matches the efficiency you get from many high-end home solar systems. Furthermore, the PC also supports Dynamic Solar Tracking to automatically adjust the cells’ settings to maximize the amount of energy they can gather. Lenovo says this means the Yoga Solar PC can generate enough juice to play an hour of videos after only 20 minutes in the sun. But what might be more impressive is that even when the laptop is indoors, it can still harvest power from as little as 0.3 watts of light to help top off its battery. Finally, to help you understand how much power it&#39;s gathering, Lenovo created a bespoke app to track how much light the panels absorb. Unfortunately, Lenovo doesn’t have any plans to turn this concept into a full commercial device. But after playing around with it, I was pleasantly surprised to see how solid and sturdy its chassis felt. Unlike a lot of prototype devices, the Yoga Solar PC Concept doesn’t feel like that much of a stretch technologically compared to other notebooks on sale today. Its PV cells sit safely behind a sheet of glass (or possibly plastic, Lenovo wouldn’t confirm which one) while also adding a bit of distinctive visual flair. However, the biggest hurdle (and possibly a big reason why we haven’t seen more laptops like this) is that for people who want to use solar panels to charge their devices, it’s probably easier and more versatile to rely on a standalone solar array instead of something built-in to the gadget itself. Regardless, Lenovo’s Yoga Solar PC is a surprisingly polished concept that I’d love to see get more attention in the future.

    "description": "The ThinkBook line has sort of become Lenovo’s de facto testing ground for far-out ideas and ambitious concepts. See the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable we saw just a couple months ago at CES. But at MWC 2025, the company is pushing things further than ever through the new ThinkBook 16p Gen 6 and four of its display accessories — which range from practical add-ons to something that’s more like a Tamagotchi. The ThinkBook 16P powering all of Lenovo’s crazy concept accessories isn’t all that different from the company&#39;s previous 16-inch workstations. It sports up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 2785HX chip with as much as 64GB of RAM, 2TB of PCIe storage and an NVIDIA RTX 5070 GPU. You get the choice of either a 3.2K IPS display with a 165Hz refresh rate or a slightly lower-res 2.5K IPS panel with a faster 240Hz refresh. There’s also plenty of connectivity including dual Thunderbolt 4 ports, three USB-A jacks, a full-size HDMI 2.1 and a card reader. Lenovo&#39;s Magic Bay 2nd Display Concept attached to the ThinkBook 16p Gen 6.&nbsp; Sam Rutherford for Engadget One interesting addition is that Lenovo included a discrete NPU (separate from its main chip) that offers up to 32 TOPS of additional performance. This should provide a nice boost, particularly for anyone who needs to run demanding AI tasks locally. That said, for the rest of us lay folk, it’s largely unnecessary. However, the real spectacle is Lenovo’s assortment of accessories. They all connect to the ThinkBook 16P using the company’s Magic Bay docking system, which was first introduced to this product family a couple generations ago. For people who constantly yearn for extra space to multitask while traveling, Lenovo has two add-ons to choose from. The Magic Bay 2nd Display Concept is a small 8-inch screen that attaches magnetically to the ThinkBook 16P. It can be used simply as an external monitor or as an AI dashboard that displays widgets, messaging apps and other tools. On the flipside, the Magic Bay Dual Display Concept adds not one but two additional 13.3-inch panels that flank the notebook’s primary screen, giving you a huge amount of real estate for pretty much anything. In addition to using the laptop’s mounting system, this prototype also features a built-in kickstand to help keep the whole contraption stable. This is important because while it is rather complicated compared to most accessories, once you get everything set up, it really does a good job of recreating the multi-monitor workstations people have at home or in their office. Lenovo Magic Bay Tiko Pro Concept display Lenovo As for Lenovo’s remaining two concepts, they are so new the company wasn’t able to show them off during my preview session. The Tiko Pro Concept looks like an even more streamlined take on 2nd Display, as it’s a slim panel with an extra-wide aspect ratio that’s meant to sit across the top of the laptop’s display, sort of like an external notification shade. Meanwhile, the non-pro Tiko Concept is a circular screen that houses an AI companion with its own set of emoji-based faces, gesture-based responses and more.&nbsp; In case that’s not enough, Lenovo even teased a cat-themed headband that adds little ears to your robotic friend. At this point, you may be asking how the Tiko is supposed to increase your productivity? And for that, I can only guess that having a friendly face around might boost your mood and thus improve your productivity. Or at the very least, it could be a more charming way of seeing stuff like Slack reactions. Honestly, I have no idea, and I’m not sure Lenovo does either. Now I have to stress again that all of these accessories are concepts, so there’s no guarantee that they’ll ever officially go on sale. Lenovo says they are merely prototypes meant to help expand and explore how its Magic Bay docking system could be used in the future. But in a time when so many PC makers seem to be having trouble thinking up ways to innovate, it’s clear Lenovo isn’t being shy about thinking outside the box. Sadly, the ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 is not slated to be available in North America, but for those in Europe and Asia, keep an eye out for it to go on sale sometime this spring or summer.

    "description": "I love a game that screams things like “neato!” and “godlike!” while I’m feverishly pressing buttons and darting my eyes around the screen, trying to make my fingers work as fast as my brain. My skills in the Playdate game XTRIS are definitely not godlike, but there’s just something about that classic arcade announcer voice that makes me think each time, “ this is the one where I’ll finally crack the leaderboard.” (It never is). XTRIS is a $4 game by Fletch Makes Stuff that’ll have you chasing a moving X around a board made up of either four, five or six tiles. The timer’s set to 60 seconds, and in that time you have to land on the X as many times as possible. Each X you collect will go tumbling dramatically off the grid and be added to your score, which is faintly displayed in the background. If it sounds easy, it’s not. The X moves fast, and as you race after your target using the D-pad to control the movement of a black square, things become increasingly intense. The music builds like an alarm that’s telling you time is almost up, and flames start shooting up from the bottom of the screen. All the while, the announcer (voiced by Jordan Carroll) is shouting words of encouragement that start to feel a little ominous by the end. It’s wonderfully chaotic. Despite the relatively simple presentation, XTRIS really lives up to its promise of being a “juicy arcade action directly into the palm of your hand.” For each of the three levels — Tetromino, Bridge and Squiggle — you’ll be able to see how other players scored, and how you stack up against them. And once you’ve played a certain level a few times, you’ll be shown your own score trends to see how you’re improving (or plateauing). I keep telling myself, “just one more try” when I finish a round, and we all know how that goes. There’s a Zen Mode for each level as well, so you can work on your dexterity without the time crunch and with a chiller track playing. If you poke around in the menu, you can also find some unlockable characters and symbols to switch up the appearance of the game, swapping the X for something like a frog or a slice of pizza. XTRIS is available now on the Playdate Catalog.

    "description": "According to Rolling Stone , employees with the Federal Aviation Administration were told on Friday to “begin finding tens of millions of dollars for a Starlink deal,” after The Washington Post &nbsp; reported that the FAA may cancel its $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to overhaul the US’s airspace management systems and go with Elon Musk’s company instead. Whether the FAA has actually dropped its Verizon deal in favor of Starlink has yet to be confirmed publicly.&nbsp; Anonymous sources told Rolling Stone that the orders from FAA officials on Friday were “delivered verbally” to staff, in an “unusual” move. It comes a few days after Musk claimed on X that the situation around air traffic control communications is “extremely dire,” saying the existing system (which he wrongly attributed to Verizon before later adding a correction ) is “breaking down very rapidly.” He went on to say that “Starlink terminals are being sent at NO COST to the taxpayer on an emergency basis to restore air traffic control connectivity.” Bloomberg , citing sources close to the matter, previously reported that 4,000 Starlink terminals were being sent to help upgrade the FAA’s networks, which the FAA confirmed. In a statement posted on X in response last week, the FAA claimed it’s “been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration.” As recently as Wednesday, though, the FAA said in statements to The Washington Post and other publications that it had not made a decision about its Verizon deal.&nbsp; The agency is one of many that has been hit by layoffs led by Musk’s DOGE over the last few weeks, with hundreds of FAA employees fired in February.

    "description": "Firefly Aerospace’s first attempt at landing on the moon was a success. The company, which is working with NASA under the agency’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program , announced early Sunday morning that its Blue Ghost lander softly touched down on the moon, and it’s upright and communicating with the team back home. Blue Ghost landed at 3:34AM ET in a region known as Mare Crisium. While Firefly’s lander isn’t the first commercial spacecraft to land on the moon, it is the first to land properly — Intuitive Machines’ Odysseus ended up on its side last year after a faster-than-planned descent. Blue Ghost and the NASA instruments it’s carrying are expected to remain in operation for about 14 Earth days. After that, lunar night will begin. If all goes as planned, the lander will capture images in the leadup to lunar night and a few hours after darkness falls, getting high-definition imagery of a total eclipse, the lunar sunset and other moments to document the behaviour of levitating lunar dust. NASA is also testing instruments that can drill and collect samples from the surface. Firefly’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 launched on January 15 and reached lunar orbit about a month later. The team says it’s already sent over 27 GB of data back to Earth from its journey. “Just through transit to the Moon, Firefly’s mission has already delivered the most science data to date for the NASA CLPS initiative,” Shea Ferring, Firefly’s Chief Technology Officer, said in a statement , noting that the hardest part of the mission is over. On X, the company shared a photo showing the lander's shadow on the surface of the moon following its successful touchdown, and joked, “The lander saw her shadow, 2 more weeks of ops!” This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/fireflys-blue-ghost-lander-successfully-touched-down-on-the-moon-155728834.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-xiaomi-15-ultra-is-a-leica-powered-photo-showcase-143001055.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Practically every flagship phone can take a great picture. But that hasn’t stopped Xiaomi from continuing its partnership with legendary camera maker Leica to produce a photo powerhouse in the new Xiaomi 15 Ultra. Powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, it goes without saying that the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has top-notch specs. It also has a huge 6,000 mAh battery, which is bigger than anything you get from Apple, Google or Samsung. Meanwhile, when it comes to charging, wired speeds go up to 90 watts or just a tad slower at 80 watts wirelessly, which is no mean feat. And unlike most phones sold in the US, it comes with a power adapter in the box. Elsewhere, the 15 Ultra sports a gorgeous 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 1-120Hz refresh rate and up to 3,200 nits of brightness. It’s also available in three colorways: a white model with an etched back, black with an almost rubbery textured finish and a special Silver Chrome edition that draws inspiration from some of Leica’s old-school cameras. I appreciate that the white model I tested features subtle swerves carved into its back that shine in the sunlight. But let’s be honest, that two-toned metal and black one is easily the most attractive of the bunch because it really leans into what this phone does best. In back, there’s a massive circular camera module that normally I’m not a huge fan of when used on rival devices like the OnePlus 13. However, on this device, it’s more than just a showpiece because inside it is some serious photo hardware. The Ultra 15’s 23mm equivalent main camera uses a massive 1-inch 50-megapixel Sony sensor. Then, for stuff like expansive landscapes, there’s an f/2.2 50-MP ultrawide cam. But it doesn’t stop there because there’s not one but two zoom lenses: a 50MP midrange shooter with a 70mm focal length plus a super high-res 200MP periscope array with a 100mm focal length (which equates to a 4.7x optical zoom). Now, I haven’t had a ton of time to fully put it through its paces, but from what I’ve seen so far, the Xiaomi Ultra 15 has one of the most well-rounded photo toolkits around. It’s got Leica optics along with big sensors and lenses that cover pretty much every focal length you’d need on a daily basis. And on the software side, there are some preset Leica filters like Vibrant or Authentic to really drive home the collaboration between the two brands. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, one of the things that impresses me the most is that Xiaomi even created a separate Photography kit that includes an add-on camera grip with a physical shutter button, an adjustable dial and a dedicated video button. There’s also a case that allows you to attach a standard 67mm filter adapter. This means, assuming you have the right gear, you can take some of the same glass you use on your real camera and use it with the Ultra 15. And this isn’t just some half-hearted afterthought either, as the kit also comes with bonuses like a hand strap, a decorative lens ring and two different removable caps for its shutter. Notably, unlike some Chinese phones like those from Huawei, Xiaomi handsets still have access to Google services, so you can download apps from the Play Store. Even the company’s HyperOS 2 is a relatively minimalist Android skin that looks good and is easy to use. And while this model will be available globally starting at around €1,499, sadly there are no official plans to bring it to the US, which is a real shame because no one is really selling handsets like this in America anymore.

    "description": "While I naively hoped to see the Galaxy S25 Edge ahead of MWC, that wasn’t what I saw last week at Samsung's pre-show briefing. However, what I did see might intrigue many of you: a cheaper slice of Galaxy hardware in the form of the Galaxy A56. It will be available later this year, starting at $499 (or £499 in the UK), which is slightly cheaper than the Pixel 8a when it first appeared. Samsung also announced the Galaxy A36 and A26 today, and they'll start at $399 and $299 respectively.&nbsp; Many of the A series upgrades this year match what we saw from the S25. The A56 is thinner than its predecessor , down to 7.4mm from 8.2mm, while packing a marginally bigger 6.7-inch screen. The bezels, which were usually one of the most prominent visual tells of an A series, have been shaved the device’s bezels down further on the A56, too. Photo by Mat Smith for Engadget. The hardware has been tweaked, with a brushed metal frame and a minor design twist: a new slightly protruding bump on the side where the volume and power buttons sit. When I got to handle the A56 briefly, I liked this. Asymmetry aside, it was easier to handle, which was surprising since this was a 6.7-inch device, and I’m more used to 6.3-inch phones. The A56 felt less unwieldy. (Did Samsung’s designers read my unhinged editorial on the sides of phones and decide to muddy the waters further? Perhaps.)&nbsp; It's a mixed bag on camera specs this year. The front of the A56 now has a lower-res 12-megapixel selfie camera, while on the back sits an upgraded 12MP ultrawide, 50MP main sensor with an f/1.8 lens and optical image stabilization. There’s still a 5MP macro lens for someone out there.&nbsp; Those new cameras feature many of the latest upgrades on the S25 family, including improved image signal processing for better low-light performance, as well as a raft of AI features, including enhanced subject detection in portrait mode. Samsung says the A56 will better recognize sky, skin, faces, hair and grass for improved bokeh effects. Regarding AI-powered image editing, there’s also Object Eraser, auto trim for videos and Create Filter, where you can choose an existing image and apply its color and tone to a different photo. You'll also get Best Face, which lets you pick from multiple captures for everyone's best expression, as long as you have motion photos enabled. These aren't new features on smartphones, but their addition brings the midrange A56 closer to the Galaxy S25. Through One UI 7, the A56 gets style flourishes and home screen improvements like the Now bar, notification panel changes and scalable widgets in different shapes and sizes. Samsung also promises six generations of OS updates (up from four on last year’s A55) and six years of security updates. Photo by Mat Smith for Engadget. As you can tell by now, there aren’t any surprises here. The 5,000mAh battery is the same size as the A55's, although the charging speed is now 45W. The company says you can charge the device fully in just over an hour. Samsung has swapped to its own 4nm Exynos 1580 chip, too, with CPU boosts of around 18 percent. The hardware, once again, inches closer to the quality and premium feel of what we typically see on Galaxy S devices. It's peak midrange phone season. The Galaxy A56 goes up against the recently launched iPhone 16e , while rumors suggest Google's Pixel 9a could break cover very soon.&nbsp; The Galaxy A36 and Galaxy A26 Samsung also announced the Galaxy A36 5G and Galaxy A26 5G today, which both have 6.7-inch screens that get as bright as 1,200 nits and refresh at up to 120Hz. They come with One UI 7 as well, including features like Circle To Search that previously launched on pricier phones. Plus, they also feature triple camera systems on the rear with a 50MP main sensor, though their ultrawide setup camera is not as sharp as the A56 at 8MP. Some of the software features, like Best Face, are also reserved for the A56, though you'll still find the updated Object Eraser and Filters on the pair of cheaper handsets.&nbsp; Finally, though the A36 and A26 have the same IP67 rating and 5,000mAh battery as the A56, they'll only pack 6GB of RAM and the A36 uses the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor instead of the Exynos 1580 in the A56.&nbsp; Galaxy A56 price and availability In the UK, the Galaxy A56 will go on preorder on March 2nd and launch on March 19th. It'll come in four “awesome” (Samsung’s wording) colors, Graphite, Olive, Pink and Light Grey. Because nothing screams awesome like a lighter shade of grey. While we do have US pricing, Samsung hasn't shared more precise timing for availability than \"later this year.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsungs-midrange-galaxy-a56-has-ai-photo-editing-and-a-bump-for-its-buttons-230018254.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Side Quest , formerly called Mere Mortals , will premiere on March 26 on Apple TV+. It&#39;s the spin-off/expansion series for Mythic Quest , a comedy show on the streaming service about a video game studio developing an MMORPG of the same name. All four episodes of Side Quest will be available on the service on the same day the season four finale of Mythic Quest drops on the platform. Side Quest will revolve around the lives of the fictional studio&#39;s employees, as well as the players and fans impacted by the Mythic Quest game.&nbsp; The show will take on an anthology format, with a bunch of actors taking on leading roles for each installment. It was created by Mythic Quest writers Ashly Burch, John Howell Harris and Katie McElhenney, who also served as executive producers. Burch plays the character of Rachel in the original show. Charlie Day, Megan Ganz and Rob McElhenney, who created the Mythic Quest series, served as executive producers for the spin-off, as well. Lionsgate, 3 Arts Entertainment and Ubisoft produced the show for Apple TV+.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/alphabets-taara-chip-uses-light-beams-to-provide-high-speed-internet-140040922.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Alphabet has announced a new development for Taara&#39;s technology that could lead to low-cost, high-speed internet connectivity, even in far-flung locations. Taara&#39;s general manager, Mahesh Krishnaswamy, has introduced the Taara chip, a silicon photonic chip that uses light to transmit high-speed data through the air. The Taara chip is abut the size of a fingernail, far smaller than the technology the Alphabet division has been using. Taara Lightbridge, which is what its first-generation technology is called, is the size of a traffic light and uses a system of mirrors and sensors to physically steer light to where it needs to go. The new chip uses software instead.&nbsp; Taara is a project under X, Alphabet&#39;s moonshot factory. The high speed wireless optical link technology underpinning the project was originally developed for X&#39;s Project Loon internet broadcasting balloons. Alphabet pulled the plug on Loon in 2021 and focused on Taara instead, using its technology to beam broadband across the Congo River and the streets of Nairobi. Even years before Loon shut down, Alphabet&#39;s X was already toying with the idea of using light to beam internet and tested the technology in India .&nbsp; Taara&#39;s technology works by using a &quot;very narrow, invisible light beam to transmit data at speeds as high as 20 gigabits per second, up to distances of 20 kilometers (12.1 miles).&quot; It&#39;s like traditional fiber, in the sense that it uses light to carry data, except that light doesn&#39;t travel through cables. Instead, Taara&#39;s hardware emits beams of light. The beams from two units must be aligned with each other to be able to form a secure link that can transmit data, which is why Lightbridge was fitted with the parts needed to be able to physically steer the light. Taara&#39;s new chip doesn&#39;t need those components: It contains hundreds of tiny light emitters controlled by software with automatic steering Krishnaswamy said Taara&#39;s light-beaming units will only take days to install instead of the months or years it can take to lay fiber. During tests in the lab, the Taara team was able to transmit data at speeds of 10 Gbps over a distance of one kilometer (0.62 miles) using two of the new chips. They&#39;re now looking to improve the chip&#39;s capacity and range by creating an &quot;iteration with thousands of [light] emitters.&quot; The team expects the chip to be available in 2026.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/alphabets-taara-chip-uses-light-beams-to-provide-high-speed-internet-140040922.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Amazon's generative AI vision for Alexa is appealing, but unproven",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazons-generative-ai-vision-for-alexa-is-appealing-but-unproven-140014416.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Amazon’s long-awaited update to its assistant is almost here. About 18 months after the company first previewed the “next-gen Alexa” built with generative AI, it unveiled Alexa+ , and early access will be available starting in March. Alexa+ will exist alongside the older Alexa and will cost $20 a month , unless you have a Prime membership, which will make it free to use. The new assistant will come with all the modern upgrades that its contemporaries like the redesigned Siri or Gemini offer, like more conversational interaction, better contextual understanding and the ability to “summarize complex topics” and “make suggestions based on your interests.” But it does one thing differently, and it’s the way Amazon purports to integrate with third-party apps and the rest of the internet that could set it apart. At the presentation, vice president of Alexa and Fire TV Daniel Rausch outlined three ways the new assistant can integrate with other services you use. Firstly, it already works with “tens of thousands” of integrations already available, with Uber, Sonos, Samsung and Xbox being a few of the many logos that were displayed when Rausch said this. Presumably, that means Amazon worked with these partners to get their apps to play nicely with Alexa+ through their APIs. Secondly, for the large swath of the online world that doesn’t have apps or the resources to code an API just for Alexa+, the assistant should be able to scour the internet for their website and navigate it on your behalf. During the presentation, Rausch demonstrated how Alexa+ was able to go to the Thumbtack website to hire a professional to fix his oven. Instead of having to whip out a phone or laptop to click through menus himself, Rausch could just verbally tell Alexa+ what he needed and what times he was available, and the AI did the rest. Sam Rutherford for Engadget This example in particular struck me as very similar to Google’s restaurant-reservation system Duplex , which, since way back in 2018, could call businesses on your behalf to book a table. All you had to do was tell Google what date and times you were considering, how many people were in your party and it would make the call for you, even speaking in a human-sounding voice to the restaurant. The way Alexa+ would click around websites on your behalf seems like Duplex on steroids. Finally, Alexa+ can work with the “AI agents” on other sites, so you can talk to just one assistant instead of dozens of chatbots. In the presentation, Rausch got Alexa+ to work with the AI music generator Suno to come up with a country-style song about bodega cats. After the company’s presentation, I spoke with Rausch to get more clarity on how Alexa+ will work with the rest of the online world. For one, I wanted to know for sure if that third method would work with customer service chatbots from companies like Capital One, United Airlines and more. While Rausch said that he had no details to share on specific names or services, he did confirm that “the SDK is all about integrations like that,” saying it’s for people to use Alexa to connect with agents on their behalf to complete tasks. Rausch is aware that any friction at all in the adoption and setup process can turn people away. To that end, upgrading to Alexa+ should not require any additional sign-ins or authentication. You should be able to have all your connected appliances, security cameras and home routines carry over without any effort. “The reason that customers love Alexa is it takes away all the complexity,” Rausch said. People don’t need to remember the brand of the WeMo plug they bought, for example, to be able to tell Alexa to turn off a lamp. “We would never take that away,” he said. When you’re adding new services after upgrading to Alexa+, Rausch said you’ll either do so “in the ways that you do it today” or that it’ll get even easier, since “Alexa can walk you through those setups in many more cases.” Sam Rutherford for Engadget According to Rausch, instead of having to “dig around in the Alexa app, you just say ‘Alexa, I want to set up a streaming account with Hulu&#39; or something.” You’ll be presented with a QR code on an Echo device with a screen to facilitate that, and the assistant should guide users along the way. “We like to say Alexa is an expert, and now an expert on herself.” Amazon isn&#39;t the only company that has made its assistant perform tech support for users. This approach is very similar to how Siri can teach you how to, say, shoot a video in Cinematic mode or create a Genmoji. Where better to get help about a product you’re using than the product itself? Why make me go to a different place for information? “From a customer experience perspective, customers just want the thing done,” Rausch said. “They don’t have to be responsible or care about any of these things, right?” He believes people just want the plumber or a reservation booked, and don’t want to fuss around with websites and phone calls. People do want their digital assistant to be helpful and easy to use, but isn’t it equally important that these AI services are accurate and reliable? When I asked Rausch how Amazon worked around the tendency of generative AI to hallucinate and sometimes spread misinformation, he said “I actually think in the industry, there’s been a mistake of thinking a model is a product.” He also said “LLMs are at the foundation of the architecture, but they’re not the only thing answering the question.” In other words, Alexa+ is using a combination of Amazon’s knowledge graphs, reliable sources on the internet and partnerships with authoritative outlets. “Other products will simply give you an answer out of the LLM. If you&#39;re asking for an authoritative answer, that&#39;s not actually sometimes the way to get one. and I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re highlighting,” he said. Rausch added that Amazon has “taken great care” with Alexa. “Will it make mistakes? Every piece of software makes mistakes,” he said. “But we’re working hard to ground it in knowledge.” I’ve yet to try out Alexa+ for myself, and everything we’ve seen so far has been in highly controlled demos, so it’s hard to tell what real world performance will be like. But if the new Alexa is truly able to work with third-party services in a way that’s seamless and effective, it would not only bring Amazon back into the consumer AI race, but could possibly give it an advantage over the likes of Google, Apple and OpenAI. Considering Amazon really brought the idea of a virtual assistant into homes around the world, this could also have an impact that goes beyond the tech-savvy users of today’s AI services.

    "description": "As Engadget celebrates its 21st birthday this weekend, we're rounding up all of the recently published reviews from the last few weeks. It's already a busy time for the reviews team, even though spring is still officially a few weeks away. The latest entries include a new iPhone , the latest from NVIDIA and those Beats workout earbuds the company teased months ago. Pour a couple bevvies for the weekend and make one a double, because we're old enough to drink now.&nbsp; iPhone 16e Apple's new \"budget\" phone has arrived, providing the most affordable gateway to Apple Intelligence. While the iPhone 16e offers solid performance, expected long battery life and a great display, there are some caveats that you might not be able to live with. \"In my week or so with the iPhone 16e, I felt the drawbacks of the camera the most — I can live without MagSafe and the Dynamic Island,\" Cherlynn writes . \"But what the iPhone 16e does offer is fast performance, a clean design, long battery life and, most crucially, cheaper access to Apple’s ecosystem.\" NVIDIA GeForce 5070 Ti If you're in the market for a new 4K gaming GPU, the RTX 5070 Ti is a a nice upgrade over the regular 5070. However, finding one, and doing so for a decent price, is another thing entirely. \"I knew it would be a tad faster than the 4070 Ti Super, but with the addition of multi-frame generation, it's also a far more capable 4K card,\" Devindra says . \"And it's definitely more future-proof than the 5070, since it has 16GB of VRAM like the 5080.\" Sony A1 II With A1 II, Sony had to live up to its own high standards. And while the camera may be the company's best mirrorless option yet, it's not a huge leap over the A1. \"The innovation that Sony is known for is lacking here, and on top of that, the A1 II is very expensive,\" Steve explains . \"The A1 II is only a mild upgrade over the A1 and when it comes to video, it’s lagging behind the Nikon Z8 and Z9 as well as the Sony R5 II.\" Steve also took the DJI Flip for a spin. He gives the creator-friendly drone high marks for 4K video quality, battery life and a people-safe design. The drone's obstacle detection isn't the best though, and it struggles in windy conditions.&nbsp; Lenovo Legion Go S While Lenovo has already teased a new version of the Legion Go gaming handheld for later this year, the company introduced the more streamlined Legion Go S in the meantime. There are some things to like here, including a more portable design, an 8-inch 120Hz display and handy controls. For now, the price is the main problem.&nbsp; \"The issue is that Lenovo hasn’t fully rolled out all of its variations,\" Sam writes . \"So even if you aren’t holding out for the SteamOS variant, you’d be silly not to wait for less expensive versions to come out with starting prices closer to $600 (or even $500 for the one with Valve’s platform).\" Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 After an initial tease months ago, Beats finally debuted its updated Powerbeats Pro workout earbuds. The hook design remains, but there are significant upgrades both inside and out, including Apple's first dance with heart-rate tracking in an audio product. \"On the whole, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are a substantial upgrade over the original,\" I explain . \"They’re more comfortable and have a host of new features that help it match today’s earbuds.\" I also reviewed the Noble Audio FoKus Rex5 earbuds in the last month. This set offers the best sound quality I've experienced on wireless earbuds, thanks in part to the company's use of five drivers in each one. However, the Rex5 is expensive at $449 and it's far from a complete package in terms of features and noise-canceling performance.&nbsp; Other notable reviews and a look ahead Managing editor Cherylnn Low spent more time living with the Kindle Scribe 2 and updated the review with some long-term observations about the tablet. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 was wrapped around the wrist of buying advice senior report Amy Skorheim as she put yet another incremental update from the company through its paces.&nbsp; My review of the Technics AZ100 earbuds that one a Best of CES award from Engadget is coming soon. As I suspected during my brief hands-on in Las Vegas, the improved sound is the star of the show here, but I won't spoil the rest of the review with more observations. MWC 2025 is happening next week, so whatever is announced during the show will certainly be on the upcoming review agenda. For now, you can check out our preview here .&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-iphone-16e-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-sony-a1-ii-and-more-130054263.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Dungeons &amp; Dragons faithful have another option for times when a physical tabletop isn't feasible. Wizards of the Coast's Sigil is a 3D virtual tabletop (VTT) experience that borrows some elements from video games without straying too far from the joy of sitting around a table with like-minded cohorts. It launched publicly this week and is now available for anyone to try. If you have no clue what a 3D VTT is, imagine a graphical recreation of all the hallmarks of tabletop D&amp;D: virtual versions of a game board, miniatures, dice, character sheets and so on. It isn't a full-on video game like Baldur's Gate because the characters are still static minis that you move around as if they were physical pieces. But it adds digital touches like animated spell effects and lighting. If done well, it's like recreating top-of-the-line D&amp;D gear (with some added flair) that you can use to play with anyone in the world. Sigil (named after a city in D&amp;D lore) isn't the first of its kind. BouncyRock Entertainment's TaleSpire is a popular 3D VTT currently in early access for PC and Mac. And its business model will be preferable to many: Everyone pays $25 as a one-time purchase. Although Sigil is free to tinker around with and join others' games, you'll need a D&amp;D Beyond Master Tier subscription ($6 monthly or $55 annually) to host multiplayer games and unlock extra goodies like builder kits and mini customization options. Wizards of the Coast Where Sigil has an advantage is its integration with D&amp;D Beyond's character sheets. So, if you've already built out your characters, equipment and abilities with the official D&amp;D digital companion service, you should (at least in theory) have an easy transition. Sigil provides a library of assets, brushes and lighting effects for you to play around with and customize your maps and minis to your heart's content. \"These customizable tools let you bring your world to life, whether you're exploring fantastical landscapes, towering fortresses or dangerous dungeons,\" the company says in its pitch. It also includes tabletop-esque touches like virtual dice that tumble realistically across the game board. You can customize your miniatures with different scales, sizes and appearances. \"All of our assets are created in a way that's like actually buying a high-end mini or figure,\" the company said in its 2024 introduction video. \"We wanted them to feel kind of painted, but kind of realistic — trying to capture that beautiful in-between where art, figures and games come together.\" Wizards of the Coast Sigil runs on Unreal Engine 5 , and you'll need at least a decently powerful gaming PC to partake. Although its minimum system requirements are less daunting, D&amp;D Beyond recommends at least an Nvidia RTX 2080 , AMD R9 380 or Intel UHD on the GPU front, along with 16GB of RAM. It's Windows only for now, but the company wants it to eventually run on consoles, mobile and maybe even your fridge. (Fridge-top gaming, anyone?) If this sounds like your kind of adventure, you can sign up with your D&amp;D Beyond account on the product page . (For a more established alternative, you can also give the highly rated TaleSpire a spin.)

    "description": "Anyone looking for an alternative to Instagram might have a suitable candidate in Flashes , a recently launched app built on Bluesky that seems to get all the important basics right. Flashes technically launched on the App Store on February 24, but a series of updates released in the days after launch have made the app much easier to recommend. If you remember an Instagram before Meta turned it into its Facebook replacement, you have the basic gist of what Flashes is. It's an app for sharing photos and videos, with some Bluesky-flavored wrinkles, like multiple custom feeds to choose from instead of Meta's algorithm-driven default option. Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget When you first open Flashes you'll be prompted to login with a Bluesky account or create a new one to use exclusively with Flashes. If you use your existing account, the app essentially repackages image and video posts from whoever you're currently following into an Instagram-style feed. This setup also works in reverse: Any post you put on Flashes will also show up in your normal text-focused Bluesky feed. The app itself features multiple tabs, with a home tab for your feeds, a search tab where you can search for posts and view trending topics, a dedicated tab for creating new posts, a notifications tab that features all of your Bluesky notifications and a profile tab. Flashes includes some filters to apply to your photos, along with some custom feeds that you can use if you want, but otherwise customizations are minimal. It's really an image and video-focused version of Bluesky. That comes with some annoying drawbacks, though. If you get a lot of Bluesky notifications, you'll now get them twice, once in the Bluesky app and once in Flashes. If you delete your account from one app, it will also be deleted from the other. Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget Building a more customizable, portable version of social media that doesn't lock you to one platform is a big part of Bluesky's goal with the AT Protocol and what apps like Mastodon and Threads are trying to do with ActivityPub. It's not clear if one standard is going to become the default, but Bluesky has been picking up momentum. The app hit 20 million users in November 2024, prompting a dramatic expansion to its moderation efforts , and then passed 30 million users in January 2025. Flashes design means all of those new Bluesky accounts are potential Flashes users, too.

    "description": "Developer Necrosoft Games has assembled another huge bundle of games on Itch.io to support a good cause. It includes more than 400 games that can be yours if you pony up at least $10 to support wildfire relief efforts in Southern California. Tunic , one of our favorite games of 2022 , is arguably the highest-profile game in the California Fire Relief Bundle. Buying this beautiful, Zelda-esque adventure on Steam right now would cost you $30. That alone makes the bundle great value, though it includes over $3,200 worth of games. There are a few other particularly notable games on the list. You may have heard of restaurant sim Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! , the fairly self-explanatory SkateBird or the utterly ridiculous Octodad: Dadliest Catch . There's also Hidden Folks , a charming puzzle title that we reckon is a great way to help you destress . Hundreds of other lesser-known games await your curiosity too. For instance, there's a pretty puzzle-platformer called Hoa that I've been meaning to get around to. Along with video games, there are physical table-top roleplaying games (including a Bugsnax card game you can print and play), asset packs, books, comics and other projects in the bundle. You'll find a few Playdate games in there as well. Note that there are no Steam keys available through this bundle, but it's not too complicated to set up an Itch.io launcher on Steam Deck. Organizers are aiming to raise $100,000 for CORE (Community Organized Relief Effort). The Los Angeles-based organization \"offers direct monetary support to survivors of the fires and supports projects for fire resilience in affected areas (and potential disaster zones),\" the bundle's page states. Save for processing fees, all proceeds will go to CORE. The campaign, which will run until just before midnight ET on March 13, is already over three-quarters of the way to its goal. The wildfires that struck Southern California in early January damaged or destroyed more than 18,000 structures and led to the evacuation of more than 200,000 people. As of February 12, 29 people are known to have died in the fires.

    "description": "Square Enix just announced a new sub-brand called Dragon Quest Golf , which is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a team dedicated to making golf merchandise and accessories based on the long-standing JRPG franchise. As expected, one of the brand’s initial offerings is a golf ball based on the iconic blue Slime. This is typically the first enemy players encounter in a DQ game. The company will showcase more merch at the 59th Japan Golf Fair on March 7, though Square Enix hasn’t yet revealed any other gear besides the aforementioned ball. I could see a golf bag based on a Weartiger or tees designed to resemble an Eggsoskeleton. Maybe a super-powerful driver named after a Golem? The possibilities are endless, though it’ll probably just show off a bunch of golf shirts and khakis with DQ branding. Why is Square Enix doing this? The company said it&#39;s all about shifting demographics, according to a translation by Siliconera . The franchise has been incredibly popular in Japan since its introduction in 1986, which was almost 40 years ago. Folks who started with the first game could now be grandparents. Also, Japan loves golf . Incredibly, this isn’t even the weirdest gaming-adjacent merch to pass our eyeballs this week. Honda just announced an absolutely bizarre &quot;near life-size recreation of the Legendary Pokémon Koraidon.&quot; It’s powered by the company’s self-balancing technology, so Honda says it’ll be able to walk on all four legs. Just like Dragon Quest Golf merchandise, this thing goes on exhibit on March 7.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/intel-once-again-delays-its-long-awaited-ohio-chip-fabrication-facilities-185516274.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Intel announced that it's further delaying plans to open two chip fabrication facilities in Ohio, pushing their completion out to 2030. The company originally announced its plans for Ohio in 2022 , with an ambitious opening set for 2025. Intel says it completed the \"basement\" level of its Ohio One project last quarter, which allows above-ground construction to get underway now. The $20 billion dollar project is technically split across two different chip fabs, dubbed Mod 1 and Mod 2, which won't be completed at the same time. Mod 1 is now set to open in 2030, to \"align the start of production of our fabs with the needs of our business and broader market demand,\" according to Intel. Mod 2 will be completed the following year in 2031. Intel Corporation The justification is financial: Intel says it's taking a \"prudent approach\" that will ensure the chip fabs are completed in a \"financially responsible manner.\" Intel previously told the state of Ohio that it was delaying the fabs until 2027. It also delayed the groundbreaking of the project seemingly to incentivize the passing of the CHIPS Act in 2022, according to a report from The Washington Post . More delays add to what's been a tumultuous period for Intel as a company. In December, former CEO Pat Gelsinger was pushed out , likely because he wasn't pulling-off Intel's aggressive plans to expand chip production. Prior to that, the funding the company was set to receive through the CHIPS Act was reduced by $600 million . Add in layoffs and the continued dominance of chip makers like AMD , and Intel remains in a tricky spot.

    "description": "Fubo TV is bringing in more subscribers and revenue but still losing loads of money. Ahead of its proposed Hulu + Live TV merger, the broadcast streaming service increased its subscriber count by about four percent in Q4 2024 and its quarterly revenue by eight percent from a year earlier. And hey, it only lost about $41 million in the quarter, so things aren't too shabby! The streaming service ended Q4 with 1.676 million paid subscribers. That's up from 1.61 million in Q3 and 1.45 million in Q2, so the company is doing something right in attracting new customers. Its total revenue has also grown: nearly $1.59 billion for the year (up 19 percent from 2023) and $433.8 million for the quarter (up eight percent from Q4 2023). Not too shabby! But Fubo is losing boatloads of money — just less than before. It posted a net loss of nearly $178 million for the year, more than enough to ruin most individuals and small- or medium-sized businesses. But since this is corporate America, things are looking up there, champ! That's because Fubo improved its losses by over $115 million from a year earlier. The company is headed for some big changes. Pending shareholder and regulatory approval, Disney will buy a 70 percent stake in the company and merge it with Hulu + Live TV. The deal would create a new entity to manage the two brands, although the plan is for them to continue as separate services (at least at first). Fubo is arguably the best live TV service for sports, but it still has some notable missing pieces. For starters, you won't find any Warner Bros. Discovery content. That means subscribers will miss out on a bunch of NBA games (before TNT's deal with the league expires at the end of the season) and MLB games on TBS. It also recently increased its prices , with the cheapest plan coming in at $85, slightly more than YouTube TV . Like the traditional cable it's gunning to replace , live streaming TV is increasingly an expensive hot mess.

    "description": "We've published our review of the new \"budget\" iPhone 16e, but if the savings there don't feel like quite the bargain you were looking for, there are a few consolation deals on other Apple gear — along with a handful of sales on more tech we currently recommend. The spotlight deal highlights the lowest price yet on a four-pack of Apple AirTags (now $65 at Amazon ). We also noticed Amazon is still running a deal that tosses in a free $200 gift card with the purchase of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (we gave the new phone an 89 in our review ). Other deals include a discounted Anker charger , a hefty coupon on our favorite budget cordless vacuum and more. Here are the best deals from this week that you can still get today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spotlight deal Apple 2024 MacBook Air M3 for $899 at B&amp;H Photo ($200 off) : The next generation of the MacBook Air with an M4 chip is likely on the horizon . But there's little chance it'll be $200 off. The nice thing about most Apple gear is it tends to be relatively long-lived. So if you don't need the latest model, this deal could be one to snag. We gave the 13-inch model a high score of 90 in our review and named it the best laptop you can buy . Note that the discount applies to the Air model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in the Midnight colorway. Also at Amazon .&nbsp; Apple Pencil Pro for $99 at Amazon ($30 off) : If you have a newer iPad and want a compatible Apple Pencil to go along with it, take a gander at this deal, which is $30 off and about $10 more than the record low. The Pro stylus allows for squeeze-based gestures, haptic feedback, pressure sensitivity and the ability to sense when the stylus is rolled to change the orientation of pen and brush tools. Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget Apple Watch Series 10 for $329 at Amazon ($70 off) : This is the same deal we've seen for a few months now, but if you missed it the other times we mentioned it, here's another chance to save $70 on Apple's latest generation flagship smartwatch. It's currently our favorite smartwatch overall and we gave it a positive review when it came out back in September of last year. It has a thinner design this time, but a larger screen. The health tracking features are great and it's an ideal companion for an iPhone.&nbsp; Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with a $200 Amazon gift card for $1,300 at Amazon ($200 off) : When Samsung's latest premium phone came out this January, Amazon offered a free $200 gift card for pre-orders. The same deal is still going strong, so if you were holding out to see what the reviews said (we gave it a score of 89 ) before you bought it, then you still have a chance to get the same deal. If you shop at Amazon regularly, you might consider the $200 gift card akin to free money.&nbsp; Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $38 at Amazon ($17 off) : It's not an all-time low, but still a pretty cheap price on a Bluetooth speaker. We recommend two Anker Soundcore speakers in our guide to portable speakers and this is the budget version of those. The 12-watt speaker isn't the most powerful, but you do get 24 hours of battery life on a charge and it's waterproof. For less than $40 it could be a good option for a knockaround speaker you don't have to worry too much about.&nbsp; Anker Anker USB-C Nano 65W charger for $30 at Amazon ($26 off) : We've seen this price again and again over the past few months, but it since one can never have enough wall chargers on hand, we'll mention it again. This is the larger version of the Nano charger we recommend in our fast charger guide and should serve you well for speedy refills on your laptop, smartphone and tablets. Reolink Altas PT Ultra 4K solar security camera for $139 at Reolink ($71 off) : In our newly published guide to security cameras , the Reolink Atlas earned the honor of best camera with solar power. We like the big battery, affordable solar panel and hi-res video quality. Also at Amazon with a clickable coupon .&nbsp; Rad Power Bikes RadCity 5 Plus plus battery for $1,499 at Rad Power ($699 off) : The ebike company's bestselling commuter model with a 14 Ah battery is selling for $1,499, which is $699 off. The battery is $499 on its own, so this is still $200 less than buying the bike on it's own at full price. The deal will run through March 12 and you'll see the full discount when you add both the battery and bike to your cart. Here at Engadget, we've tried out a few Rad Power bikes and found them to strike a good balance between quality and affordability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valentina Palladino for Engadget Tineco Pure ONE S11 cordless vacuum for $199 at Amazon ($100 off) : The budget pick from our guide to the best cordless stick vacs is currently on sale for $100 off. It's relatively lightweight, easy to use and the suction is great for the price. It also has a feature that adjusts the suction to accommodate the amount of dirt it encounters.&nbsp; Crucial X9 Pro (1TB) for $70 at Amazon ($31 off) : We've seen this deal a few times in recent months on one of our favorite portable SSDs . It's not the absolute fastest model but quick enough for most needs at a reasonable price. We also appreciate the rugged design and the fact that it stays cool with extended use. Also at B&amp;H and Best Buy . Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget ASUS ROG Ally (Z1 Extreme) for $450 at Best Buy ($200 off) : This is the original ROG Ally that came out in mid-2023. It's not as powerful or ergonomic as the newer ROG Ally X , and we still think Valve's Steam Deck is he best gaming handheld overall . But this is cheaper than either of those models with similar capacites and it can play games from Steam, the Epic Games Store or the Xbox app. This deal ties the all-time low for the model with an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip. ThermoWorks Thermapen One for $79 at ThermoWorks ($30 off) : We recommend the Thermapen One in our guide to the best grilling gear . It reads temperatures quickly and accurately and has an easy-to-read display. This isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked, but this Engadget-exclusive deal marks the lowest price we could find in the last few months. Every day, Engadget editors hunt down the best discounts on the tech we recommend. See them all on our deals page .

    "title": "The best iPhones for 2025: Which model should you buy?",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-iphone-160012979.html?src=rss",
    "description": "It’s a question you may have heard many times before: “Which iPhone should I buy?” Most of the time, the answer is simple: Get the best one you can afford. And if you’re happy with your current iPhone, don’t feel like you have to upgrade at all. If you are ready to make a change, though, we’ve tested all seven models in Apple’s current smartphone lineup and picked out the ones that should satisfy most people. Before you dive in, note that we’ve based this guide on the list prices for current, unlocked iPhones on Apple.com. If you can find a heavy discount from another trustworthy retailer or a good deal on a refurbished model, that could always change the value equation. Table of contents Best iPhones for 2025 The rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2025 Recent updates Best iPhones for 2025 The rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2025 The iPhone 16. Billy Steele for Engadget Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have made genuine improvements over their predecessors and generally feel more “Pro-like” than they have in years past. They also come in a range of vibrant colors. If the iPhone 16 Pro or 16 Pro Max are just too pricey, especially if you want extra storage space, they’re fantastic compromises. Still, they are compromises. If you can afford it, the Pro should hold up a bit better over time. Apple iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus The iPhone 15 and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus still get you many key upgrades over the iPhone 16e, including a superior two-camera system, a brighter display, MagSafe and the Dynamic Island. The 15 Plus is particularly appealing as the most affordable big-screen iPhone in Apple’s current lineup. It has excellent battery performance as well. At $699 or $799, though, both phones are priced in something of a no man’s land. Most people who care about ultrawide cameras and MagSafe support should just spend another $100 for the iPhone 16 or 16 Plus, which add AI features, a slightly improved ultrawide lens with macro support, an extra hour or two of battery life, faster wireless charging (25W vs. 15W), a quicker processor, more RAM, the Action button and the Camera Control button. Those who just want the essentials, meanwhile, are probably happy to save an extra $100 on the iPhone 16e, which is still better equipped for the long-term thanks to its faster chip and Apple Intelligence support. As a result, the 15 and 15 Plus will probably make the most sense if you can find a good price on a refurbished model. Recent updates February 2025 : The new iPhone 16e replaces the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus as our “budget” pick. We’ve also removed our notes on the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE (3rd generation), as each has been formally discontinued. January 2025 : We've made a few minor edits for clarity and ensured our recommendations are still up to date. December 2024 : We’ve made a few edits to reflect the release of Apple Intelligence, though our picks remain the same.

    "title": "$20 a month for an AI chatbot? In this economy??",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/20-a-month-for-an-ai-chatbot-in-this-economy-150021310.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The only surprise in Amazon’s reveal of Alexa+ this week was the price. With inflation rampant and many more impactful subscription services to choose from, $20 per month is an absolutely bonkers price for an as-yet unproven AI chatbot. Recall that Alexa has historically not cost anything as long as you've had hardware to run it. The same goes for Google Assistant (and now the basic version of Gemini) as well as Apple’s Siri. They’ve always been tools to enhance hardware, not the product itself. What's stranger is that $20 per month, which I will reiterate is bonkers , is essentially fake — the equivalent of an inflated MSRP . And the reason I know that is because a whole-ass subscription to Prime costs $5 a month less , and includes Alexa+ . You can read this one of two ways. Amazon thinks Alexa+ is worth more on its own than the entirety of Prime. Or, the ridiculous pricing is an artificial speedbump to steer people into Amazon's ecosystem while also encouraging them to buy some Echo hardware while they’re at it. Somehow a company accused in the US and Europe of deceptively separating customers from their money hasn't tried this trick yet. In a vacuum, $20 for Alexa+ does line up with some other premium AI services — OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus and the Google One Gemini Advanced plan both cost the same. And Amazon is doing something at least a little different by letting a generative AI voice assistant loose on your smart home, just as it did with the original Alexa. And I do find the option to build a library of uploaded documents within Alexa+'s memory intriguing, much as I'd prefer anyone but Amazon be the one storing that info. But despite some potentially useful features, it’s impossible to recommend spending that kind of money on Alexa+ now, given that Amazon predictably flubbed some demos in its presentation and hardly let any journalists at its event really test it out. I don’t think Amazon is expecting a ton of sign-ups at that $20 monthly price. Besides prodding more people to sign up for Prime, this wild price for Alexa+ telegraphs a move to jack up the cost of Prime sooner than later. It’s been just over two years since Amazon increased Prime’s price, so we’re certainly due for another gouging. Of course, the company will point to Prime’s “increased value” over that time, and to be fair you do get a lot your dollar at this point — assuming that you want to continue spending more cash at Amazon. And Alexa+, with its built-in ability to make a grocery list and order it through Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods, slots nicely into that framework. Vanilla Alexa's propensity to order regular, non-perishable goods from Amazon — sometimes without users intending it — will of course carry over. My recommendation? Given the economy, just back the hell away from this entirely. There are plenty of services that are more entertaining or useful for your money. Google’s Gemini Advanced plan comes with 2TB of Drive storage and a handful of other perks. Or you could sign up for Xbox Game Pass. Or blow your money on a couple video-streaming services and let the #content wash over you as we slide into the abyss. At least those options aren’t a portal to handing Amazon more of your hard-earned cash.

    "description": "Microsoft is officially getting rid of Skype as of May 5 and encouraging its users to pick Teams once and for all. In its announcement, the company stated that the move will allow it to \"streamline our free consumer communications offerings so we can more easily adapt to customer needs.\"&nbsp; Microsoft is also far from subtle in its push for Teams and included step-by-step instructions for migrating over. All users need to do is log in with their Skype credentials and their chats and contacts should appear. Teams and Skype users will be able to communicate with each other until the latter shuts down. Microsoft also published an entire YouTube video illustrating how to transition user data. However, anyone who doesn't want to move to Teams can choose to export all of their data and history before May 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The news is hardly surprising given recent moves such as removing credits and phone numbers from Skype in favor of subscriptions. XDA initially reported the possibility of Skype shutting down, with a Skype for Windows code preview reading, \"Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams.\" New users won't be able to access paid Skype features, while current subscribers can use credits and their plan through the end of their renewal period.&nbsp; Skype launched over two decades ago in 2003. Microsoft acquired Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011 — right around the time myself and everyone I knew was desperately searching for a strong enough Wi-Fi connection in their home to talk with friends (yes, really tough situation here) and before video chats became the norm at work.&nbsp; While Skype doesn't really have much to differentiate it in a world filled with the likes of Zoom, FaceTime and, yes, Teams, it's still hard to say goodbye to a service that provided such excitement and connection. Skype felt like a new era of communication and it will be missed.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/skype-will-take-its-final-curtain-and-video-call-may-5-144256172.html?src=rss",

I'm Senior Editor Devindra Hardawar. Cherlynn: I'm Managing Editor Cherlynn Low. Devindra: This week, it's the iPhone 16e, which Cherlynn has reviewed. We're going to get her full thoughts on that thing. And also, Amazon held an AI event this week. We expected a lot of devices, but they spent 75 minutes talking about Alexa plus, which is the AI powered Alexa. You know, that they, Cherlynn: we expected a lot of devices. We have one. Devindra: I expected one device, maybe Cherlynn: one, at least one it's been a while. Devindra: Mr. Panos Panay was there, the father of the service and no devices, just him talking about AI. So that's weird. Cherlynn: Oh, and stay tuned at the end of this episode. Uh, I, we included an interview that I did with, um, the vice president of Alexa to talk more about the new Alexa plus. Devindra: Anyway, folks, if you're enjoying the show, please be sure to subscribe to us on iTunes or your podcaster of choice, leave us a review on iTunes and drop us an email at podcast@engadget.com. You can also join us on our live [00:01:00] stream on Thursday mornings, typically around 11 a. m. Eastern. Um, you'll see our faces. Sometimes we'll do Q&amp; A and show off devices as well. This week, uh, Sherilyn has the iPhone 16e, which is the least, um, impressive thing to show off. It's just like, Hey, you have an iPhone from 10 years ago, five, a while ago, Cherlynn: when, when Devindra: last, was there a single camera back iPhone? Cherlynn: Oh God, before that was 11. I think so. Devindra: Yeah. Like a while ago. So, you know, it's like a flashback. All right. So let's talk about this thing, Sherlynn. And I checked out your review. First of all, you gave it a really, um, I think serviceable score. Like you're saying 77 out of 100. Your title is what's your acceptable compromise. And really when we were talking about it last week, it really was like compromise seemed like the key word. The thing we kept coming back to was like just one camera, no mag safe, no fast wireless charging. What are your overall thoughts on this thing? Cherlynn: I mean, so that headline is like all thanks to our EIC, Aaron [00:02:00]Souppouris, because I was like, where, where do I go from here? How do I, so, so he's right. It is like, instead of what's in your wallet, it's like, what are you willing to take out your wallet? I don't know. Um, okay. I'll tell you the story. Okay. So yesterday I was at the Amazon devices and services event where there were no devices and A bunch of other reporters had gathered and we were all like, you know, the, like, review's going up soon, right? And so we were all talking about our thoughts on the 16E. Uh, I was with Lisa Eadiccico, who's now at CNN and Julian Chokkattu from WIRED. And like, they were both going off about their own, like, grievances first. Julian was the first to be like, I can't stand that there's no magsafe. And I was like, huh? I almost like, was like, oh, I didn't really. And then Lisa goes, oh, I didn't mind that so much, but I can't stand that there's no dynamic island. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I pointed out that I didn't care about either of those, but I care that there's only one camera because there's so many. So all three of us had different things we couldn't. Devindra: I mean, you're all power reviewers, right? We are. Um, Cherlynn: but we, so, [00:03:00] so I can understand that like a lot of the little, you know, the things that we find to be compromises are very unique to like each person's use case. And I think that that's the thing and that's why I went with that headline in the end. It is ultimately like you are the one that accepts these compromises. You are the one as a person considering an iPhone that has to decide what's a, an okay compromise for yourself. Um. And for me, the, the single camera is just, I can't, I can't abide, I can't live with it. So, um, I, to me, the lack of ultrawide initially was just like, all right, well, I mean, I don't, you know, maybe I don't need an ultrawide. Maybe that's okay. Maybe my parents will need an ultrawide. But I didn't realize until spending more time with the phone that it's not just that, right? Like the lack of a second camera or a second, like, source of data for Apple to pull information for photography, computational photography stuff means that a lot of other things are just poorer than what you actually already have out there. So portrait mode was for me the biggest deal. Um, [00:04:00] there's also like you can't do the same photographic styles as you get on the regular iPhone 16s. Uh, there's just. Yeah, even when it does apply portrait mode, it's, it's just less accurate. Um, the sort of where they draw the line as to where to apply the blur is a bit messy because there's just one camera and it's doing face detection. So yeah, look, the, the other intriguing things about the iPhone 16E or like to, to kind of give it a few. You know, here's your positives. Um, affirmations, I guess it's like, yeah, it looks like right. And iPhone 16, it doesn't seem to deviate too far from this year's lineup. And that's like for the first time in a long time has an entry level iPhone, like an S E. Looks so similar or like the gap between the iPhone 16 E to the iPhone 16 is not as far as the iPhone SE 2022 was from the iPhone 13, and that's a point that like Aaron pointed out [00:05:00]as well. So that closeness to the iPhone 16 lineup is largely, I think. Due to, I mean, what you can't see is the A18 chip inside, right? They have the same chip across the entire iPhone 16 lineup, which is kind of bonkers to me. And then there's also the fact that it looks externally quite similar, unless you open the screen, then you see the notch, and then you see the thicker bezels. And then it's like, all right. And also like, don't go look at the rear, right? The camera is just like a dead giveaway. But otherwise, if you're just kind of like staring at someone on the train, holding onto the iPhone 16e, it's not easy to tell which model they have if you're Not immediately looking at their camera. Um, so yeah, I mean, those are some good things about it, right? The display is an OLED, and like, yes, I know that of all the choices they could have made, an OLED's not necessary. Like, for an entry level iPhone, but the, it is very bright. Um, it doesn't get quite as bright as iPhone 16 or even iPhone 15, but it's nice. I don't like that it refreshes only at 60 [00:06:00]Hertz, but it's just much more vibrant. So Devindra: does the base iPhone right now still. Yeah, yeah, exactly. The non Cherlynn: pro phones don't have ProMotion, which is 120 Hertz or up to 120 Hertz refresh rate. So, you know, you would need to like shell out quite a lot more money for 120 Hertz refresh rate on an iPhone. Um, and I guess. That's just what you gotta live with. And also to be fair, it probably impacts battery life in a way that you wouldn't enjoy anyway, because I feel like the pro phones last about a day. Yeah. Devindra: They have variable, like, refresh rates too. So it's like, it slows down depending on like how fast you're doing shit. Right. I feel like an LCD that was a higher refresh rate would be an overall better looking experience than just, you know, putting OLED at 60 Hertz, but yeah. Cherlynn: Yeah, I think that's like a personal thing. I like OLED. So like, I like the look of it. I really enjoy. Yeah. Not a fan of the LCDs, honestly, but here's the thing. Um, when I said battery life, also one of the great things about [00:07:00]the iPhone 16 is its battery life, right? Like I think it does last a lot longer than the iPhone 16. Um, Partly because I don't know, maybe because it doesn't get quite as bright, but like partly because it has a bigger battery. And I think all of us reviewers were kind of hesitant to be like that modem. Is it going to work or not? Cause it's like very hard to say. Um, I think most of us were supplied with the, like with service for our review units and it was like, And for me, it's really hard to be like the C1 modem works better than my iPhone 16 pros, like whatever modems in there, because it was AT&amp; T versus T Mobile, right? It really wasn't down to the Hardaware. It was down to the fact that my carrier just. doesn't have as good coverage as AT&amp; T, sad to say. Um, so I can't tell you, I, I wrote down like, yeah, I did the speed test and fast. com like testing on both phones, but it's just not. And we can't just throw Devindra: over a SIM card anymore because there are no more physical SIM cards in iPhones. So we used it's just not, Cherlynn: I mean, it could support a dual SIM, like I could. [00:08:00]you know, support, like, uh, I could have set up a different SIM card in there to just to really do the, you know, apples to apples testing on an Apple phone. Haha. I get it, but I can't Devindra: move it as easily as you used to be able to. Cherlynn: Yeah. Yeah. I, it's like give up my own phone for hours or it's just not, it wasn't like super easy to do within the span of like a week that I had the phone. So anyway, it could be due to the C1 modem that battery life was better, but in general, like I just find that the non pro phones. All kind of last longer than the pro phones the pro phones have always on display Which is one thing that I think drains the battery, too And to be clear the 16e 16 or 15 don't have always on display either So there's a lot of like little things that you have to consider you're doing a lot of Specs sheet peeping. I mean, I think we pointed out last time when we were talking about the iPhone 16 E that like, you know, you don't have wifi seven, you don't have a thread, you don't have ultra wide band. And that's not just in millimeter wave 5g, but also in like locating things precisely, right? Like when you're [00:09:00] using find my, and also you don't have max safe. Um, 5 Watts as opposed to 15. So there's a lot of these little things. And depending on the audience, it may or may not matter. I don't know that my mom will care. Devindra: Um, For the people who don't know what they're missing, basically. Right. Cherlynn: But then for those people is 5. 99 the price point, right? Like it's, Devindra: I don't, yeah, Cherlynn: I don't, I don't think Devindra: so. Like given all the compromises you're listing, um, This is such a, Apple has put us in a weird spot, right? Because like 599, it is the cheapest iPhone, but used to be, I wrote a whole thing last year is why the base iPhone 16e was actually a pretty good deal, given everything they put in there, and it was cheaper than the pros, and that thing is what, 800? The base Cherlynn: iPhone 16? Devindra: The 16. Yeah. Just the 16. Yeah. Um, and to me that felt like given everything they put in there, it seems good. This one at 600 does not seem like a big enough difference cost wise to like turn [00:10:00]people. Yeah, that's the main thing. And also I think, so I set up an iPhone 14 plus for my mom. I was talking about last week and she loves it, but also she really needs that bigger screen. You know, um, even though it's slightly harder to hold, like it is much easier once you're dealing with, you know, um, older eyes, basically, you kind of need bigger screens to use these devices correctly without like putting on reading glasses every single time. And that's why the plus end up being a good one. So I don't, I see people saying like, this is a good cheap one for your parents or something. A lot of people may actually find this even too small or harder to use. Cherlynn: And so, so when you're considering that, right? Like. You want a big screen on an iPhone, the cheapest one you're going to get is the 15 I think. And that one is going to start at the same price No, wait, uh, same price as the iPhone 16, um, smaller one. So, no matter what that decision is, whether you're going for iPhone 16 16 or 15 plus versus 16 E. The difference is [00:11:00] 200. And if you're financing your phone over two months, that is like a few dollars a month over 24 months. Aaron and I were talking this out and Aaron was like, I'm happy to eat two ramen meals instead of like going out every month, just to save that money and make up for it, it's like, it's quite easy to do the math here and, and. And go for something better instead of the 16 E, like for me. If you like taking photos at all, don't do the 16e to yourself. I mean, again, it's going to be a huge improvement in quality over the iPhone 11 and up, but even the iPhone 11 onwards has dual cameras. Devindra: Yeah. Cherlynn: Quality itself is the same, but versatility is different, you know, so. Devindra: I mean, I kind of feel that, like, I don't want to sound like, Hey, just put everything on credit or installment plans, right. Or deal with your carrier payments. But that is kind of the way costs break down, at least in the U S I'm sure in other countries where you're not paying, you know, monthly, or if you're paying like all up front, A lot of people just want to buy their phones out right then. Yeah, this is legitimately cheaper and you'll feel that in your [00:12:00]pocketbook. But I also agree that, um, the smartest thing to do is not to give away all your money, right? But also not to pay extra interest on it. So the carrier payment plans are actually pretty good. And if you do, if you throw in an upgrade in there, that's how they juice you, right? Like, that's how they get to they're like, Oh, we're going to give you 800 in credit for this very, very old phone. But yeah, the trade is like that credit is useless outside of paying for a phone. But if you care about paying for your phone, then it's actually pretty useful. So that's how I ended up getting like the 16, not the 16, the 15 pro max for like, not much because I just traded in an earlier iPhone and you have a good phone for like Cherlynn: two years. Yeah. Yeah. Devindra: Yes. Play the system, folks. Like, play. These carriers want to give you money. They want to tempt you with things. Um, the cheapest path for an iPhone may not necessarily be just the one Apple is selling, but again, also look at the used market. Look at other things. Uh, yeah. I'm surprised you didn't bring up the iPhone 16 plus, Sherilyn, because that one is [00:13:00]900. So not much more. Yeah, it's a bit far out. You're getting closer to the pro. There. Any other thoughts on the 16? Yeah. Because I just feel like, hey, yes. It's a cheaper iPhone with a lot of compromises and I just feel like I don't think we'll be talking about this phone very much after this week. Cherlynn: Okay. Devindra: Yeah. Cherlynn: So my thoughts on the reviewing the iPhone 16e. Um, and the other things that I really like are that being forced to use a phone that feels like it's from like, I don't know, five, at least five years ago, right, made me actually grow to appreciate the features I've taken for granted on the 16 pro that I kind of pooh poohed at the start. Right. So things like dynamic Island, I'm surprised. I'm like, Whoa, I actually liked dynamic Island and, and to Lisa's point, when she pointed out that she, um, missed it, I'm like, yeah, actually it is. Become, and it's not the aesthetic of it. It's not the all screen. It's the fact that it's functional. Your live activities sit there. It makes a big difference. And going back to the notch was like, huh, where's my waveform for my voice memo? You know, it's kind of like, Uber timer. Where's your, [00:14:00] Devindra: when is your delivery? All that stuff is really Spotify Cherlynn: controls. All of that stuff. I mean, there is some kind of like some apps still sit at the top nicely, but not in the notch. And so it's just kind of weird. Um, the other thing that I've found myself missing from the iPhone 16 pro is weirdly camera control, but not in the way you'd expect. So what I like about camera control, having it versus not, is that. It's a really quick way to launch your camera in a dedicated, like it's just dedicated shortcut. You don't need to think about it. You just press it and it opens. Um, and the 16E has the action button that you can customize to do that. And so I found myself doing that, but the thing is you have to give it up, you know, like whatever, like, for example, I use the 16 pros action button to switch between silent mode and not silent mode and same. On the 16E, you can't have both at once, so that's kind of sad. You can still use the lock screen shortcut, of course, but I don't want to have to pull out my phone, swipe the screen, and then take a photo. I'm just like, take it out of my pocket and it's good to [00:15:00]go, you know? So those are the things, like, I learned from my review, not specifically about the 16E, but about these other features Apple has introduced that, like, I wasn't super impressed by at the start, but, like, now I'm like, oh, they have actually. I've grown used to them in my life and That's why long term reviews are important. And I would say, stay tuned to our website. We'll see like more of these long term thoughts. Devindra: That's uh, yeah, I think that's ultimately it. It is, this is, I think for listeners of the show, probably not a phone. A lot of people would be buying. Ben, for the love of God, do not, um, Yeah, don't, don't do it. Cherlynn: Get the iPhone 15. I think you might enjoy, especially because if you don't care about Apple intelligence and don't. You know what all the fuss is about? The 15 is a good phone. Devindra: 15? So, the 15 Pro, like, honestly, any of those, although it's only the Pro Max that works with Apple Intelligence because it has the additional RAM. No, the Cherlynn: Pro. The Pro alone will get you intelligence, so you're fine. Just do the 15 Devindra: Pro? Cherlynn: Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay. Ben: Yeah, no, I wasn't aware of that because I [00:16:00] was about to say that reading the Reviews for the 16e convinced me to get a, um, 16 base model or 16 pro, because I read Sherlyn's review and Julian's review at Wired back to back, and Julian made The really interesting point of, okay, yes, Apple intelligence going to be in its infancy right now, but if you want continued access to all of the stuff that might be coming in the next like year and a half, two years, two and a half years or so, because I do keep my phone for a while, then it's a good idea to have something that Like can get that right now Ben for you Devindra: specifically the voice notes transcription thing That could be useful in addition to other recording you're doing that's like instant transcription of an obsession you're in or something So Ben: yep, that's good stuff. So like if i'm doing um Recordings with like lav mics any of those lav mics that have gotten [00:17:00]really popular in the last couple of years You see tiktokers using them and everything like that You should be able to use Apple intelligence to Transcribe this stuff that you recorded into, you know The sure app or the road app or whatever like that Devindra: not yet But I think that'll definitely come anything else you want to add Trillin because we got we get stuff Cherlynn: I was going to say that the iPhone 15 Pro, just to confirm, it does support Apple Intelligence, so you can consider that. I mean, like, that's going to be cheaper than the 16, it's the same price as the 16, I'm sure. That's what I'm trying to do right now, is to confirm the iPhone 15 Pro pricing for you. I, I don't know that Apple still sells the 15 Pro though, so if you can find it, get it, but if you can't. You Devindra: know, and after you're giving up the camera button, if you go for 15 pro and also any potential other, I don't know, I don't know if they're gonna have like lock off points for like what apple intelligence features you get because you'll have a slightly lower, um, you know, intelligence chip than, uh, I mean, maybe Cherlynn: in future, right? [00:18:00] Like if, if we're thinking the apple intelligence is gonna stick around for five years. Sure. Ben: Yeah. Cherlynn: But I mean, yeah. Um, I'm not saying don't will in Ben: some capacity. Cherlynn: Sure. Sure. In, in some way. They might retire the name or something, but they'll still have the feature of like, yeah, intelligent Siri or whatever. Devindra: I don't, I, they're so dug in, like all these companies are so dug in, they would look ridiculous. So if they're just like, forget about all that AI stuff that we tried to feed you. It feels they're stuck with it Cherlynn: piece from three, five years ago. I can't, everyone's, I, Devindra: no, at least it's safe. At least these are, don't think these are features you can touch and feel and they do shit. Um, but some of them don't. Some of them just don't work well, NFTs were just like useless anyway. Let's move on. Let's move on. We got other news. Let's talk about in talking about potentially useless features. Amazon announced, uh, Alexa plus, sorry for people who have echoes nearby, but the AI powered version of its voice assistant that they've been talking about for a while. They announced, I think two years ago, 2023, that they were working on a [00:19:00] better conversational Alexa using generative AI tools. We hadn't heard anything about it until now. It's coming. They fully announced it. Uh, there's no a clear arrival date yet, but it's gonna be $20 a month on its own or a part of a prime subscription if you already have it. And that is $15 a month. So clearly they just want you to get prime. That's the whole point of Amazon these days. Um, it's gonna be coming to a, you know, these devices with screens first, eventually to any of the devices. And since it's in the cloud, they're not doing onboard processing. Um, you don't have to go buy new devices. So that's cool. I think that's the main good thing here. But what is Alexa Plus, Jolene? Are you intrigued by it? Cherlynn: Yeah, uh, I wanted to say at the start of this episode, actually, really just to give people a moment to go and mute their echo speakers. So while I waffle on for a little bit, I'm not going to say the A word. You have some time right now. Walk over to your speaker, mute the microphone. But anyway, it's impossible to avoid this. I'm not saying this word, this episode at all. So [00:20:00] your, your best bet is to have muted your speaker by this point, if not pause. Okay. So, I mean, we, we knew it was going to be about this, like redesign slash like next gen Alexa, um, for this event, but some of us are still, I guess, hoping for a device because it's been a long time since there's been a new echo speaker or a new echo device, new echo buds, new, like. Like a show I guess. So anyway, attending this event was intriguing. It was fun for me because it was nice to like, see people. Um, I don't know if y'all read the live blog, but there was a moment where we were like moving from one spot to another and I kind of saw Panos just kind of making his way through the crowd and nobody like knew. It was looking at it. I was like, Oh, this man is like being treated like an average Joe. And I'm like, this is Panos, excuse me. So I just went, I just like, as I was coming up the stairs, I saw him, Hey Panos. And he turns around and he's like, Oh, hi. And then he's like very friendly. He's like, I was with Lisa as well. And so like, he was shaking hands with both [00:21:00] of us and he was like, saying nice things. Oh, thank you for your very kind article to me. And then like, he's talking to Lisa as well. So we're all just like, all right. I mean, that was, that's the sort of thing I go, I like, deeply Devindra: in the eyes, because the thing about making me question Cherlynn: my life choices, Devindra: he has those, uh, you know, like when you talk to a mystic or like a magician and they just like stare into your soul a little bit, it's so funny. It was very Cherlynn: like the, and then his portion of the presentation too was funny because, okay, so the nobody. Um, and I was able to see this set up because this was not a live streamed event. You could only see our photos and our live blog. And maybe you saw, you know, social media influencers live streamed it perhaps. So, but, but to describe it for you, we were all set around the stage and there was this gigantic, Projection of an echo show, which is their like picture frame looking smart display. And there's a webcam or an actual camera, I'm sure built into where the camera of the echo show would normally be on this gigantic a hundred inch echo show on the wall. Um, and then, you [00:22:00]know, whatever PS or other people doing demos were doing on a. More like regular size echo show probably 21 on the stage was reflected in real time on that. So at some point, um, during the demo or the presentation, they had Alexa use the webcam on the wall and see if the people. You know, watching panels do his thing, we're reacting in a certain way. Right. He was like, Oh, Alexa, like, um, uh, tell me what this 200 group of 250 people look like. And like, um, you know, I'm, I'm nervous, you know, tell me about what they're saying. Like the expressions are telling you or something like that. And it was like, Oh yeah, they all look happy. And like, they're ready to listen to what you're saying because they have their laptops open and that sort of shit. And I will say like having seen the picture. Or the view of like myself in the audience. I'm like, you know, I think Alexa did like. I mean, if it was accurate and truly like a live present demo, then it's like, it, it worked to the [00:23:00] way, like the humanity worked, right? Like it, they're good at parsing image info. Yeah. Devindra: I don't know why. If somebody had like stuck up their middle fingers or like did something really wild, like. They, it was a wi, they said it was a live demo, so they could have, Alexa could've just said that too. Like, could have pointed out they could have, I didn't, dude, being a jerk. Yeah, Cherlynn: I know. When I saw the camera open, I was like, yeah, I just put my hands up immediately. I was like, yeah, but I, I wish I should have done something different, but I wanted to verify that it was live and so like, I was just trying to move around and see if I was in it. Ben: Yeah. Good. That's a good move actually. Yeah, no, that was a good move because otherwise it could easily be a canned Cherlynn: response. Right. So I saw myself and I like was in the outfit that I was wearing that like it's just. Accurately at me, right? So, I mean, I guess that excitement in my expression did get correctly captured by Alexa, but you. Devindra: It locked onto you. Like, this one girl is a little too, too excited. One person. Please calm down. Please calm down. Yeah, like, Cherlynn: chill? Your laptop's falling off your lap? Like, maybe calm down. Um, but you know, so, [00:24:00] so, so, to my, like, what I was saying earlier is that it's been a while since they promised or previewed this, and now it's like, I don't know that I was super excited by anything I saw a demo. Hang on. There is one thing I am. And like everything else seems very reminiscent of like Gemini and like. It's the new Siri and like, um, the, I, I, I mean, I guess opening. I also get Devindra: back to what is like, what is it? Yeah, it is Alexa, but it is also smarter, more conversational. You don't have to keep saying Alexa all the time. You can continue the, whatever you're saying to it, right. Cherlynn: More conversational, natural. And if that's reminiscent of anything other than what I've already said, it's also very co pilot by the way. Like it's just. It's contextually aware of like the conversation so you don't have to follow up and say like my favorite team is this and then like, you know, how did my favorite team do? You can, you can, you know, it will remember that stuff within the same conversation. You can also send it documents and emails and stuff and have it pull out pertinent information for you. [00:25:00]So I think the demo that was given was like somebody sent their HOA, um, bylaws or whatever and asked if they could use solar panels and then Alexa was like, Right. Alexa was like, Oh, you can, but make sure it's just like, it seems like your HOA supports green energy, but doesn't want it to be visible. So as long as you use it on the side of your roof, that's not facing out, like you will be fine. That's Devindra: actually useful, by the way, like I just want to put that whole process, even if it means like you have to do something like drop a PDF to your Alexa through the website or the app or something like there are all these documents we live with. Nobody reads them all right. So, and then you get people on next door or like your neighborhood, a Facebook group who don't read asking the basic questions of stuff that's already explained. So like, if you could just talk to your Alexa and like get accurate info, that's cool. That is interesting. But also I feel like there's a downside to that because then you're putting all your trust in this machine, interpolated that correctly. Right. So they showed off one example of like, uh, Oh, you got your. Kids schedule for their sports games. When am I supposed to bring snacks for that? If that thing gives you the wrong [00:26:00]date or tells you any bit of wrong info, that's a problem for you That's a problem for your kid That's like social embarrassment because then you're the parent who screws up bringing snacks and you don't want to be that parent Because other parents are so judgy. So that's the part where I'm like, I don't I don't know how much we can trust this You know, this is a nice little helper, but you're still gonna have to double check that info. I'd say Cherlynn: Are you okay, Devendra? It feels like you think, uh, your parents are judgy. Devindra: Uh, wait, just wait, Sherilyn. Wait till you encounter more parents. I think Cherlynn: there's quite a few I've already seen online, but okay, so, I mean, there's that stuff. And then what really intrigued me about the new Alexa, and I'm writing a story on this for the website, by the way. Or I've already written, it's just not going up yet. Um, it's the third party integration side of things. So Amazon's whole point, right? Let's start from there. Amazon's whole point was that these LLM based assistants, one of their greatest flaws or weaknesses is that they can't really work well with APIs. So [00:27:00] Alexa Plus is going to work with third party services in three different ways. And it's important because you think about how all these Machine learning or like these generative AI chatbots, they generate things for you, but they rarely ever can do things with other companies and businesses on your behalf. And so this is going to be crucial to making like the Alexa plus experience much more useful because like so far we've been limited to talking to these chatbots and being like, create my essay for me, summarize this thing for me. Like it's very. Limited to generative stuff, but once you can broaden beyond that, it gets really useful. And I think that's why I'm so intrigued. And so the three ways that Amazon's going to use, um, make this work is one through API. So it's already worked with, like, it says tens of thousands of its partners at launch, um, including Uber, Samsung, Xbox, or some of the logos that we saw. So those are some sort of API integration, which means I think they've worked together with the company to ensure that that works. And that's an impressive number [00:28:00]at launch. The second way is this thing that sounds very familiar. Basically, Alexa will be able to navigate websites on your behalf. It can, like, go out to, like, um, let's say a model project's website and see, like, Find a calendar. It's a restaurant that children Devindra: can't stop ordering from. Cherlynn: I love Mala project in New York. Um, but yeah, so you can just be like Alexa, like, um, what's that restaurant we really like in the east village. And it'll be like. Oh, these are the things and then like you can be like, Oh, can you make a reservation at that second one? And it will go to the website for you and scour it and then you can just tell it things like, Oh, for three people for how many and then it'll make the reservation. Um, if that sounds familiar, it's because Google's duplex. Was supposed to do that for you with restaurants, it would phone businesses on your behalf and you literally phone the businesses and Devindra: talk to you. Cherlynn: Yeah, it would use a human voice to talk to them. And that was kind of strangely implemented the Google [00:29:00] Duplex system because it was a human talking to a machine to interact with humans on their behalf. Devindra: It offloaded so much work to the human workers and that's what pissed me off about that whole thing. Right, Cherlynn: it would bother actual human beings, which is where kind of it was very annoying. It's format that Amazon is describing has machine talking to website and it kind of eliminates that like sort of human frustration. It can probably be more likely to make mistakes in my opinion. Devindra: Like how is it talking to the website is the key. Is it talking to OpenTable? Is it talking to like a service that already exists? Cherlynn: Exactly. So, so no, so, so it can't. So there's two ways, right? One, so the open table thing is through the API method that I mentioned, um, before, which is when you have enough of these APIs, um, Alexa can form like what it calls experts. So it can have a reservation expert. It can have a food ordering expert globe. That's part of the API experience. The second part is it just goes out and scours the internet. I, I don't know the full technical details [00:30:00] yet, and I'm going to ask Amazon for more. Okay. Um, but what it is is basically, yeah, the software is going out and scraping websites and being like, here's the reservation system and here's all the available things I'm going to click through as if I am a human being, clicking through these things and initiate the reservation. So. I mean, I think that's super intriguing. That also sounds familiar. And Devendra, you'll like this and you can tell me if you have faith in this. It sounds a lot like the Revit R1s, like large action model. Devindra: I mean, sure. It's like getting the LLMs to do actions. That just, yeah, it kind of sounds like that. Again, we have to see if it actually works. I have faith in APIs because robots understand APIs, right? You trigger a reservation function to this restaurant, has all the data already there. Having a robot just be like, can you scrape the text in this? Is, does this have a form to input for reservations? Can you input into like, that doesn't, that will not work. That definitely won't. Cherlynn: Right. So yeah. Yeah. And we saw that the Rabbit R1 struggled with [00:31:00] it. So I, I don't know, I want it to work. I don't know the details of how it'll work. So like to be extra clear, right? Like we're kind of speculating a little bit here on how it all works, but it seems in essence and spirit to be very similar to Duplex and the Rabbit. R1s, LEMs, so we'll have to see how effective it really is. My question Devindra: to you, yeah, would you trust it? No, I can't. Because the just like, open OpenTable on your phone or something, or just go to Google on your phone because sometimes you can reserve right from the Google Maps thing. Right. But just doing it in five minutes on your phone. I trust that. And even then I'm like a little wary that the restaurant doesn't always check those digital reservations. Cherlynn: They don't get a concept. You show up and there's no table waiting for you. And there's nothing for Devindra: you. I don't trust that just talking to this stupid speaker that I've had for a decade, you know, that had trouble, you know, understanding me, we'll be able to effectively reserve something. I would love it for it to be able to do something like, Hey, set up this reservation on open table and let me double check it or set up a grubhub order or Uber. To [00:32:00] me, that's more useful because I like stuff I can trust. And the whole thing about the Apple, the rabbit device, I couldn't trust anything. You can trust it. Yeah. Cherlynn: I wanted to say that like, um, the, the, the demo that they did was of thumbtack, right? So thumbtack is this like professional people that you can hire kind of like handy, but I guess it has a website and doesn't have an app. So what I think that the second method that Amazon's describing brings is that it eliminates, or at least like. It opens up the playing field to smaller businesses that don't have apps, that don't have developers who can work with Amazon to integrate APIs or to come up with their own APIs. It just makes it like it levels the playing field a little bit, right? And then finally, the third way that like Amazon is making Alexa Plus work better with their party services is, um, and this is where it's a bit dystopian. It's a through all these AI agents. So Alexa can go talk to AI agents on your behalf. Uh, so instead of having to like, um, the demo again, during the [00:33:00] presentation was too soon. Oh, so like Alexa, go ask this thing to make me a country music song about bodega cats. And it was like, cool, I think you heard the song Davindra, it was a kind of a cute song. Devindra: I could barely hear it. Cherlynn: But you also could have gone to the website to ask for this song, right? So one day eventually you'll probably be able to get Alexa to talk to you, like say the United Airlines customer service chatbot or somewhere, your bank's chatbot. And the idea of these bots talking to each other is just so funny to me. Devindra: It's, it's sort of like, yeah, it's, it's, they have, um, sort of separated. The idea of visiting websites is just like, you're asking something to go visit something for you and talk to that something. So you can think of AI agents as just like websites that talk to each other, I guess, is this kind of the way this is all going, um, briefly, like we should talk about like. They talked about all sorts of other features for this too, like you'll be able to order groceries just by talking to it or other delivery services. They [00:34:00] showed off the feature of like, um, your kids can use Alexa plus to, uh, basically conjure stories together and have like shared story time together, which is the whole thing. So yeah, a lot of cool ideas. Um, to me, this is like the most useful form of like. Generative AI stuff I've seen in terms of like, I don't want to type more stuff into search fields for, um, for co pilot or chat GPT. Like I want to be able to just talk to things and have it come back with information. My other thing though, is like, I am getting the sinking feeling that. I may have to just divest myself of a lot of Amazon stuff at this point, because the very morning that this was announced, we also got, um, Jeff Bezos is a memo to the Washington post editorial, you know, op ed page where there was, he was just like, this is going to be my little kingdom and we will write about what is fair and whatever. And like, we are in the midst of like a billionaire takeover of the American government, but also of so many other things. And I'm like, I. It is wild that he took, he chose that morning [00:35:00]to do it. Uh, Jeff Bezos has been on a weird trajectory for a long time, but now it's like, can I justify Alexa Plus? Like, even if I, I'm still currently a Prime member, should I be using this or should I move to Google devices? Google has done a lot of crap, crummy things too. Should we just like, be really careful about any of these AI tools at this point? Like, there are moral questions now, the way we have to kind of sit and ask ourselves. Yeah. Cherlynn: Yeah. A bit depressing. A bit depressing. Devindra: We can't just like, you, it's, it's sort of like, you have to ask more questions now. Like I think pre iPhone era, we were like, Oh, cool, cool tech, cool, fun toy. Yeah. I can get excited for this. Speaker 2: It used Devindra: to be fun. And post iPhone it's like, well, no, this device requires lots of, uh, low wage labor in China and people were killing themselves at factories. There are all these moral costs to technology that we just used to, didn't. We didn't think about that much and now it is front and center and yeah, I don't know to me. It's something I can't stop thinking about at this point. So Alexa plus seems cool. I for many reasons. I don't know if I'll be able to [00:36:00] trust it, even though I won't be paying anything extra for it. And maybe I should just give up on Amazon Prime altogether. I don't know if you have any other feelings on that show. Lynn or bed. Cherlynn: Yeah, I mean, I agree. I think I was going to like stop buying stuff from Amazon. I have drastically decreased the amount of shopping I do on Amazon and target. It. Um, I just go and buy local things, which like I was already trying to do anyway, but now I just quite like the, the balance is swung in a different direction by a lot. And, um, but I do know that like Amazon, like the commerce and the way it's. It's, it services a lot of like businesses, like ours, it's difficult for me to like, um, every time I need to like do an Amazon, like run or something, run digital run. Um, I'll be like, all right, I'll at least like try to shop it through an in gadget link or something to make myself back the 5 cents. I don't know. I'm just Devindra: fraudulent. We're not going to get to any of that on this podcast. I don't know if Cherlynn: it's fraudulent, like, am I not allowed to buy something through? [00:37:00] I think it's only Ben: fraud if you're doing it like automated, like 5, 000 times a day. Cherlynn: I'm like every now and then I'll do it. I've absolutely Devindra: goosed my own affiliate links in the past. I will admit to that. Right. I, Cherlynn: I, I mean, if we need to cut this out, we'll cut this out. But like, for me, it's like, Devindra: I'm not here Cherlynn: telling y'all to do it. I'm just, I'm also transparently telling you that we do make Devindra: money off of it. Became a thing. So it doesn't matter Cherlynn: anymore. So, so anyway, that, that's the only way I can see continuing to use Amazon on an ad hoc basis. And also when you can't get something anywhere else, which is rare these days, but I can get, I can understand that for like certain parts of the country or the world that there's no other option maybe, or there's no easy. Uh, financially like, like comparative solution, right? Amazon is cheap. And if you're in a bind, then like, maybe that's like all you've got. So I don't know. I mean, I don't want to judge anyone for not doing it. I'm just saying I'm trying to do it because [00:38:00]we have the power. We just have forgotten. We have the power. We just, instead of exercising our collective. And I think that action is where it'll, I really would be curious to see, I'm going on a tangent now, I'd be curious to see how Target's doing now, but yeah. Devindra: I know, yeah, people are active about it. Thoughts, Ben, and then we'll run through it real quick. Ben: So to get back on topic, I'm wondering how much of Dev your tendency towards saying like, Hey, can you build an order and then let me check it is based in just kind of like old internet. Understanding like purchase requires big screen. Devindra: We're millennials. This is the thing. Like this, this is the old person's thing. Like kids will be just like, talk to their AI agents and get stuff delivered and not see all the fees and not. But I wonder. Ben: If they will be happy with what they end up getting because all it takes is like two or three garbled orders and people say, Oh, well, [00:39:00]maybe I don't want to use this. Or maybe I want to use this in a different way. So is the workflow for how you like build an order and then check it? Is that going to be something that people end up doing themselves initially and then it gets built in by the developers? Or the other way around. I Devindra: don't think you have the ability to do that. You don't have the ability to do it right now. Like you can have from what we've seen from the demos, it can produce an order for you, but I don't think you can just like fill your cart and then you will empty the cart in your, you know, Grubhub app or whatever, finish an order. I don't think that capability is there, but I think people are going to ask for it because yeah, they're going to rent to things where you don't understand the fees. There's a lot of fees on delivery apps and other things. Um, there's a lot of ways these apps can like really screw you over in terms of On top of the Ben: lack of ability for comparison shopping. Devindra: Yeah, that's what I mean. And then you're like, okay, you'll let the AI do the comparison shopping. I'm like, okay, who has the lowest fees? Who has, what's, where can I get [00:40:00]a pizza for a good price? It'll get delivered to me right now. That's the sort of thing AI should be able to solve. That's well rated and everything. Um, I don't know what I can trust. It Ben: seems like we're setting ourselves up for a situation where we're like, okay, yeah, we'll let the AI do the thinking and then there's going to be some big, um, like kerfuffle about how the AI was actually like, no, actually I prefer Amazon services. And we come back to the idea that Lenacon was right all along. Devindra: Maybe. I mean, listen, literally, uh, right now Jeff Bezos is out there, uh, turning the Washington Post, you know, editorial page into his personal playground of just like, uh, Um, I don't know. Freedom and, um, free enterprise, I think. Yeah, because that's, that's the thing that has trouble in America. Let's move on to other news real quick. I'm just gonna run down this stuff because I think it's worth the reading. Check out our stories on all of these things. Uh, framework [00:41:00] had a bunch of devices that they announced. The modular laptop company, they announced, um, a modular desktop, which is a wild concept because desktops are modular. Yeah, exactly. They're modular and upgradable and Dan Cooper wrote up all these stories was like, yes, aren't desktops already modular? But they have basically created this cool like little mini itx case that is easy to put together Um is using some standard parts and it's also using that ryzen ai max chip We talked about at ces which has a pretty good gpu So this isn't a desktop where you're going to be putting in a graphics card or something but It's kind of a cool project for like a teenager or a kid who doesn't want to build a full size machine, but maybe put together a decently capable little box that can play some games. And they're also bringing Ryzen chips to the, uh, framework 13 laptop. And also something I'm kind of excited by for they are teasing a cheap two and one convertible 12 inch laptop, the framework laptop 12 that I think could be really, really cool. So again, similar, it's going to have like modular components you can plug in, but it's not [00:42:00]underpowered. I don't think we have pricing on that yet, but hopefully it's going to be like decently priced. This, this could be a cool little thing for a lot of people. Um, so yeah, show me any thoughts on that on framework. Cherlynn: I just am trying to care. Devindra: I think it's nice to Cherlynn: support a smaller business than like the. HPs and the Lenovo's and the, you know, Devindra: Yeah, we complain about when those companies grew up all the time. So, yeah, I think it's, it's good that there are alternatives. Cherlynn: I think it's unique and cool, um, in the way that nothing as a brand, as a phone maker is unique and cool. This is maybe the nothings of laptops. Um, sure. Frameworks has been around for a very long time and there's a lot of like littler laptop brands out there. Like, um, man, they're escaping my mind. So like Frameworks is doing its own thing and I respect that. Devindra: It's a unique thing like the thing about nothing is that nothing nothing is doing is actually new or different They're just like here's a different design for an Android phone. It doesn't actually right But if Cherlynn: you don't want to support Apple or [00:43:00] Google or Samsung for some reason nothing Devindra: backed by like a major Chinese Corporation, Cherlynn: uh, that might be one plus Devindra: Yeah, yeah, well, I think Cherlynn: nothing is on his own still so yeah, Devindra: we don't we don't fully know a Christa wrote up the story Christa Bell wrote up about iPhones having a bug where they briefly changed racist liquid word racist to Trump In iOS dictation, I don't To me, that doesn't seem like a bug. So we're just going to move on from that clone robotics proto clone. Uh, one of the first, uh, lifelike robots, uh, a robot body that somebody has developed, it looks like a fricking nightmare. Uh, go check out our story on the proto clone, bipedal musculoskeletal Android V1. It looks like a zombie robot. And it's dancing on wires. It looks horrific. Ben: You know what it looks like? The, um, what character from Prometheus? Yeah. With the kind of like sandy white skin? Devindra: Yeah, the, uh, the origin I don't know what they call them. It was like the originators, the people who [00:44:00] Spoilers for Prometheus the people who seeded humanity, essentially. So that's cool. That's a whole thing. Uh, Benny brought up the story, human therapists prepare for battle against AI pretenders, and this is like, um, therapists essentially think like AI bots are going to be a big problem when people start to ask them for mental health help. And there have been stories of where people have harmed themselves. Teenagers have hurt themselves because of what they were seeing from an AI bot, basically. So that's dangerous. Yeah. The thing Ben: that really concerns me is how accessible these are on Metaproducts right now. Because if you do enough scrolling on Instagram, you'll see like their little Like chat bot insert between a couple of the posts of, you know, from accounts that you follow, hopefully a viewer would be able to see like, Hey, this is right next to like an AI clone of the hawk to a girl or something. So maybe I shouldn't consider this [00:45:00]like actually high quality psychological help. But, uh, you never know. Devindra: In so many ways, we are not prepared for AI. You know what, what I keep seeing in Tik Tok is like a lot of, um, I'd call them tired millennials. We're just like, um, you know, guys, we are sandwiched between the boomers who didn't understand technology. And then the, the youngs, the Gen Z who grew up with tech, but also grew up with really easy to use tech. So they never had to fully understand it. And we're Ben: sandwiched between the boomers and the iPad babies Devindra: and the iPad babies. And now we're like, Oh, so now we got to explain. I got to tell my parents how to use their phones, but also make sure my kids don't like. Uh, talk to kidnappers on, on Minecraft or Roblox or whatever. So we, we are screwed digitally. So, which is also why I'm so, I have so much trepidation around AI in general, like this stuff is going to happen. These therapists are right to be worried because people, we are so, we are weak minded primates when it comes to talk, you know, putting.[00:46:00] Um, I don't know, souls are putting like a meaning into things. So if a chatbot is talking to you like a human, you're going to treat it like a human. You're going to treat that advice like it's coming from a friend or something. And that worries me. Sherilyn, I know you care about mental health stuff. I don't know if you've thought about how this could hit. Cherlynn: I mean, I've, I've thought that the, I mean, social media has already done this. Social media has already destroyed kind of where people get their mental health info from. Um, I mean, we started first with the internet and then as the barrier to entry gets lower and lower, now we're at the barrier to entry of being a human, at least, is also falling down, so it seems like it's just, yeah, I mean, I talked to my therapist about it too, and my therapist and I, we're, we're both, you know, concerned, we're just like, eh, but it's not easy for people to, you know, get help, um, and therapy is expensive. So they're going to reach Devindra: out to whatever resources they can get. They're going to find Cherlynn: whatever they can. I mean, I, I could go on a rant for hours about how much I hate like the advice that people on Reddit parrot at each other because they [00:47:00] saw one person make this one comment one time that they liked and then they just copy and paste it everywhere else. I really hate that one person made a joke like years ago that I too choose this man's wife and now you see it everywhere by like all kinds of other people because They can't come up with their own jokes or something. I mean, I'm being mean. I think it's a funny joke, but it's Devindra: true though. Yeah. Cherlynn: Is the same delete Facebook, Ben: hit the gym lawyer up like, yeah, it, it is unhelpful. Um, and from the point of view of the developers, especially if they have no contact with. Actually going to therapy they might be like, oh, you know what therapists are like just giving out the same advice to all of their clients So why don't we automate that because I don't know the therapists might be bored or something. But oh my god That is such a misunderstanding Devindra: Yeah, too much. There's too much information flowing around, unfortunately, and like we are so bad at processing it, which is also why I'm worried about. Yeah, in general, because it's also simplifying that information even more for a really gullible populace. Anyway, let's [00:48:00] move on to what we're working on. I'm reviewing a lot of shit. A lot of GPUs are coming in. There is one fun CPU that I'm looking forward to testing in a couple weeks. So more on that soon. I don't know if you want to shout anything out, Sherlynn. Cherlynn: I mean, it's non stop from here on out, guys, we strap in, it's review season, it's event season for some reason already. So, yeah, stay tuned, come over to Engadget. com. Devindra: It's the end of February, we're still recovering from CES. Yeah, for what it's Cherlynn: worth, Devindra: this weekend Cherlynn: is Mobile World Congress. Like this weekend, Mobile World Congress starts. So just pay attention, you know, there's gonna be quite a lot of stuff coming Devindra: up. I miss going to Mobile World Congress. I miss doing that whole thing. It's actually been I think my, for the first time I did that was like, I did it on my own at my last site in 2012. And that was like a wild experience of when, like, there was so much 5G hype, there was so much 5G hype in the early, simpler days. Simpler days. I saw that Nokia, the 41 megapixel camera for the first time and that was like a big deal back then. Anyway, shout out to Mobile World [00:49:00]Congress. Check out our coverage on all that stuff. Let's move on to our pop culture picks for the week. I just want to say I've been playing a lot of Avowed. Avowed is just where my jam is because the world is insane right now. This is Obsidian's, um, kind of their Skyrim. Their like simpler, more focused version of Elder Scrolls. It's on Xbox Game Pass right now. Um, so if you have Game Pass, it's really easy to try. I just love the look of this world. I love exploring it. Um, has a really good aesthetic. If you remember that scene in the movie Annihilation, which is one of my favorites, but the scene where people start to turn into plants, the bodies of plants, um, Avowed is a game where. You play somebody who has been touched by a God at birth and you have these like Godlike powers. Um, and as you design your character, you can have like plant face, basically, you can have, uh, roots growing out of your heads or seashells or things like that. I think people, people who are tryptophobic may have a lot of trouble with this game because it's leaning into like really weird looking designs [00:50:00]for people, but also. It's a really cool fantasy world. Um, I just love like whenever I'm playing, I try to like put it in an hour at a time. I discover things all the time. Like there's always something interesting happening. It's a really fun world to just sit and explore. Also really useful thing to just like, you know, I'm testing so many video cards. It's a really good way to compare them to each other. So about, I'm really digging it. Uh, Sholin, anything you want to shout out? Cherlynn: Yeah, I've been on a documentary kick, but, uh, I would first start by telling you what you should not watch. Um. It's not a documentary, but based on like real events, the Netflix show called Apple Cider Vinegar. Really? I was saying I Devindra: was going to recommend that to you. Cherlynn: I was going to say that I started, I don't know if I already brought it up on this show, but I'm now realizing that I didn't. I tried to watch, I tried starting to watch it maybe a couple weeks ago. And I just could not, um, it's a bit too triggering for me. Uh, it's someone who's gone through a lot of like people in my life with cancer diagnoses, dying from cancer, that sort of stuff is a lot. Um, [00:51:00] I already like my, I think in last year, one of the episodes last year, I recommend this command as the podcast is that was a woman who was posing as someone suffering from breast. Cancer. Apple cider vinegar tells the tale of, um, Belle Gibson in the drama dramatized like, uh, retelling of the story of Belle Gibson, um, who claimed to be dying from brain cancer and all kinds of terminal cancers, but actually lied about it, but profited majorly off of it, and was a big Devindra: healthcare like a guru. She did a lot to spread a lot of like health, like new forms of health, right? Whatever you call it, natural health. Cherlynn: Yes, Devindra: basically. Yes, Cherlynn: like, oh, you can eat your way out of cancer, basically. Like, eat well, eat healthy. Um, and, and, and was more or less pitching it as a way to, like, you know, heal herself. But anyway, uh, and instead of watching Apple Cider Vinegar, I couldn't, but I was still very Drawn into the story. And so thankfully Netflix actually has a different, um, series called the search for Instagram's worst con artists. And it is about bell Gibson as well, but it is more of a [00:52:00]documentary retelling. The reason I really couldn't, um, stick through apple cider vinegar is because they also bring up this other influencer that, uh, bell Gibson drew inspiration from. And that person was a very young person. Yeah. Mila, um, she was diagnosed with, uh, an aggressive form of, I guess, sarcoma cancer. And so it had to be, you know, she was very young and was contending with these things that had to do with amputation. And that, that was when I had to stop because it was getting a bit too close to home. I Devindra: will say like, I think the show is really, really well done if, but it is like a lot. All at once. Um, it is well acted Caitlin Dever, who plays bell Gibson. She has been one of my favorite, like young actors for a while. I think she was in justified at one point and she was just incredible in that show. So yeah, it is a really well made show and very much like it, it feels like it's made by an Instagram, you know, somebody who was raised on Instagram basically, because like it's edited in that way, it like goes through a lot of like different ways of showing the story it's juggling three storylines at once, it is good, but I can understand why it's too much [00:53:00] for you, Sherlyn. Cherlynn: Yeah. So, so to that point, I really, I mean, I liked it. I just couldn't keep watching. I do agree with you that the style of it is really nice and very easy to follow. Um, but even if you did enjoy Apple Cider Vinegar and you want to continue watching and following on that theme, then yes, go over and watch the Search for Instagram's Worst Con Artist. It's a two part docuseries. Um, they interview Belle Gibson's brother, uh, Belle Gibson's stepfather. Um, and, and the bunch of journalists who like pursued that story and how they came to, to find out what was happening. So, yeah, very interesting to me. And so, I will leave you with that as my recommendation this week. Well, that's it for the episode this week. Everyone, thank you as always for listening. Our theme music is by game composer, Dale North. Our outro music is by our former managing editor, Terrence O'Brien. The podcast is produced by Ben Ellman. You can find DaVindra online at Devindra: at BlueSky at at DaVindra and I podcast about movies and TV at the FilmCast at FilmCast. com Cherlynn: If you want to [00:54:00] send me like social media accounts that are actually doing good in this world, you can hit me up, I guess, on threads at Sherlynn's Instagram or preferred, uh, is on BlueSky at You can also email us your thoughts at podcast at Engadget. com, leave us a review wherever you're listening to your podcast and subscribe in your favorite podcast platforms. Devindra: I've got a good social media account for you, Sherlyn, actually, and that is go watch Keith Lee's videos because Keith Lee has been touring the UK. And having a bad time with British food, it is hilarious to see in the Brits are fighting online. Cherlynn: I love that. And Devindra: it is, it's really, I will give Cherlynn: you, I will give you one like social media account that I followed that is kind of an example of what I'm looking for. Uh, we rate dogs. It's literally my favorite. Very nice. Thanks to everyone that like struggled with us through the technical issues for the live stream again today. We really appreciate you and sorry, we couldn't make it like the whole show. Devindra: It's a, it was both [00:55:00] my computer deciding not to work, but also Google, uh, YouTube just stopped streaming. YouTube just stopped letting us stream. So that's fun. Yeah. Cherlynn: Sorry guys. Devindra: Sorry folks, but thank you for listening and thanks for trying. Cherlynn: So I was able to sit down with, uh, Daniel Roche, who is the vice president of Alexa, and he was on stage presenting and doing demos of the new Alexa Plus and how it integrates, uh, with third parties. You can listen to this interview now. It will tell you a lot more about. Um, all that third party integration stuff we were describing. Speaker 5: The presentation today, your part was specifically, it seemed, about how Alexa Plus would work with all these different third party, uh, apps and integrations. Especially given LLMs don't have, you know, natural, like, accessibility for APIs and stuff. Speaker 6: Not natively integrated, yeah. Speaker 5: Could you, just for our, uh, podcast audience, and for myself as kind of a refresher, Go over that really quickly again. Speaker 6: Yeah, so at a high level there are three different ways that Alexa Plus [00:56:00] integrates with other services, capabilities, devices out there. And by the way, at launch it will be integrated with tens of thousands of different services, devices, and capabilities out there. The first way is, uh, through APIs. So APIs, you know, LLMs don't natively support APIs, calling APIs, filling out arguments the right way, choosing methods, etc. A big part of what we've done with Alexa Plus is, uh, basically building, uh, the way, you know, the nature of those integrations. And then, uh, building an at scale such that it can accommodate so many different types of integrations. You heard me talk about experts in our show today. So, uh, experts are the fundamental way that we accomplish that. So the information expert is really, really good at going out and. Uh, taking advantage of, you know, partnerships that we have with information sources, for example, right? Or, um, you saw, uh, a scheduling and reservation expert today, uh, [00:57:00] use OpenTable APIs to complete a reservation for a restaurant that's just a few blocks from here. Um, and so, APIs, uh, uh, is the first way that I would, that I would say in terms of the three, the second way is, you know, partners don't necessarily show up and have all of these different APIs ready to go, but they might have a website, uh, that has all the capabilities they want to offer to customers. Thumbtack's a great example of that. Um, they, you know, help you provide, uh, find, uh, service providers across a huge range of different kinds of services you need for your house. You need your gutters cleaned. You need a plumber. You need, uh, I use the example of my oven is broken. Um, and in this case, Alexa Plus, uh, gathers some information from you. When do you need them? What kind of service do you need? Et cetera. So in a voice interaction, you could say, Hey, my oven's broken. I need someone as soon as possible. I've got some cooking to do. Um, Alexa gives you a range of possible options, you can help pick, [00:58:00]and then Alexa goes off on the internet and goes to a website like Thumbtacks and doesn't need APIs to go to the calendar components and book a time and to the selection components and find a service provider and to all the different experiences that you might navigate yourself on their website. Alexa Plus goes off and does all that, uh, comes back and just tells you it's done. Period. Done. That's the second way. The third way is in an agent to agent way. So if there's another generative AI agent out there, and we could probably both name several, but the example I used today was Suno. Very cool entrepreneurs. By the way, and a very cool set of capabilities, uh, and they're doing generative music. So, you can just say what you want for a song. Uh, my example today was about a bodega cat. I just wanted to prove that you really can write any song you want. Um, a country song. That's right, yeah, fewer bodegas out in the country. [00:59:00] But, uh, you can definitely write a country music song about a bodega cat using Alexa Plus. And the integration with another generative AI agent in Suno, you know, we do believe the world is going to be full of different generative AI agents that have different capabilities. Alexa can help orchestrate across that full range of space so that customers can take advantage of those super specialized experiences like Suno. Speaker 5: I have a few questions. Speaker 6: Yeah. Speaker 5: Um, I'll start with, you know. A way to kind of make sense of what you're describing, which is to compare it to things that I already know are out there. And so I don't know if you've heard of or observed, um, Rabbit's R1 device. Rabbit, um, you know, team at Teenage Engineering made this wearable slash device. I have seen it, yeah. Yeah, and I think one of the biggest selling points for those of us in the industry was less the Hardaware and all of the fun stuff like the crank and more of the like promise of the large action model they brought up, which sounds a lot like what you're doing with Alexa and APIs, right? They're using [01:00:00] You know, machine Cherlynn: learned, uh, chatbots or whatever their AI assistant, uh, is being called and using that to kind of navigate third party apps without any need for really deep integration. Um, that's kind of how I'm sort of seeing a bit of a similarity. I'm also seeing a bit of similarity to Google's duplex, uh, which calls restaurants and makes reservations on your behalf. So when you're talking about the second way where the partners that don't have a Alexa can go navigate the website for you. It sounds Speaker 5: somewhat structurally similar, similar. Is that correct? Speaker 6: It might be from a technology perspective. I mean, I do think from a customer experience perspective, customers just want the thing done. Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 6: They don't have to be responsible or care about any of these things, right? They just want, I need a plumber or I want to book a table, et cetera. So we try to make sure that for, for consumers, for customers, they, Just see the same super easy to use experience, whether it's voice or a couple taps on the app, let's say on your phone to kick off a task. But then yes, I think, I think you're right to say that, um, there's this range of options happening in the [01:01:00]background, whether it's API integration, agentic, uh, Alexa going off online and getting something done. I do think the scale of Alexa Plus is unique. Speaker 2: Coming out Speaker 6: of the box with tens of thousands of different, uh, services and devices already integrated, uh, on day one for Alexa Plus, I think is unique. Speaker 5: By the integrated, do you mean that these third party services have to do any work on the backend? Is it all the second approach, which is the website crawling, or is it like some of them have to tweak? There's a range. Speaker 6: There's a range. Um, we have a lot of deeply integrated API partners, uh, Uh, you know, agents going off online is newer technology, uh, and, uh, you know, agent to agent is really cutting edge, uh, you know, agents interacting for a customer on their behalf. So I think on the timescale, um, uh, that's how, that's how it looks. I Speaker 5: mean, I think there is like a lot of appeal to just talking to the one assistant in your life and having that assistant talk to all the other AI chatbots [01:02:00] out there for you. Can I, can I just ask, I want to be clear on this. The Suno was one example, but can you say used? Alexa to talk to Capital One's customer service chatbot to get a, like a transaction, you know, refunded or something. Speaker 6: So nothing to, nothing to share today about, you know, about, uh, any of the selection that's, uh, you know, available over time. But I will tell you that the SDK is all about. Okay. You can, you know, use Alexa to, to make connection with, for you on your behalf, other agents and complete tasks. Right. So that's the whole idea. Speaker 5: Right. That's what I was trying to get at. You're on to it for sure. Okay, gotcha. Because I didn't want to like, that was the first example I could think of. Yeah. United Airlines, for example, is the other one. I Speaker 6: mean, we know, again, I think customers are going to benefit from tons of different generative AI. And we strongly believe that they should work together so that they're not disconnected. Speaker 5: So the other thing you said is that these, um, what people want is like something that they can just [01:03:00] talk to and have it done for them, right? But then the other thing that people want, in my opinion, that is lacking a lot of today is a solution they can trust to be accurate all the time. So how has Amazon worked around or how does Amazon plan to work around this issue that This notion that Gen AI as it stands is still not 100 percent reliable and accurate and trustworthy and that hallucinations can happen. Speaker 6: What is a, you know, these are non deterministic models at the, you know, at the outset in generative AI, right? They produce excellent conversation, they produce, you know, multiplicity of different answers even faced with the same question. But you can build systems around those models to ensure that they're deeply grounded in knowledge. You heard me talk about that today. That is. grounding in our own knowledge graph from Amazon, you know, using, uh, reliable sources on the internet, using partnerships with authoritative sources. You know, we have hundreds of those already on day one so that we get answers right. [01:04:00] Uh, cause customers want to be able to count on that experience. So I think, you know, what you have to do is use the right tool for the job. LLMs are at the foundation of the architecture, but they're not the only thing answering the question. And I actually think in the industry, Uh, there's been a mistake of thinking a model is a product. So the reason you're asking the question is because other products will simply give you an answer out of the LLM. Speaker 2: If Speaker 6: you're asking for an authoritative answer, that's not actually sometimes the way to get one. And I think that's what you're highlighting. So, we have taken great care with Alexa Plus. Will it make mistakes? Every piece of software makes mistakes, um, but, but we're working hard to, to ground it in, in knowledge. Speaker 5: So to clarify that last point that you said, and to make sure I've got it right, you're saying that instead of just relying on the assistant to give the answer back, you might have the assistant say, according to Succentouch website that, you know, came up with my search on the internet, this is the Most accurate sounding answer to your question. Yeah, or this Speaker 6: [01:05:00] authoritative source in my knowledge graph, right? I mean, you saw me ask about Alex Brigman, you know, some nerdy baseball stats today. And the fact is Triggered a lot Speaker 5: of fights in the Engadgeteam, but sure, let's go. That's what Speaker 6: that was all about. Speaker 5: I loved it. Speaker 6: That's what that was all about. But I do think, you know, you want, you want those answers to be right. And that means you need an authoritative source that's going to tell me about How well Alex Bregman does at Fenway. I need to be prideful here in Manhattan asking those questions. Speaker 5: Um, the other thing I wanted to ask, and it is a bit less big picture, uh, Alexa Plus is coming out, uh, early access starting next month, um, and people who don't have a plan will probably need to pay 20 a month. For people who, I guess, have Prime, that update probably occurs automatically. Um, if you're already paying for Prime, right? Like, Speaker 6: what will the customer experience be like when I get Alexa Plus? It's included in your membership. Speaker 5: So, let's say you have That's it. That's all. Right. So, you have an Echo speaker at home that's tied to [01:06:00] your Prime account, then it'll update on its own over the air. What's gonna Speaker 6: happen is we're starting with our large screen devices. So, we'll be rolling out to customers in waves. starting in March, uh, late March, most likely, um, eight inch plus screens will be the first wave of customers, uh, that will get access. A customer does accept, we are changing the experience for them. We want to make sure customers know that. So you would see it either on a device like an echo show, or you'd see it in an email, simple press of the button. And then for prime customers, the Alexa plus experience is completely updated for non prime customers. You can start. Speaker 2: Uh, in Speaker 6: that situation, uh, paying a 19. 99. There is an early access period to have in there, but that's the, that's the simple approach. Gotcha. Speaker 5: If you don't have the, uh, a Prime membership, and you somehow have an Echo speaker that's not tied to it, would you still access the older version of Alexa on that? Speaker 6: The original version of Alexa continues to be available. Speaker 5: And [01:07:00] how would they play with each other? Is there any sort of You know, a scenario where they would interact and one experience would be, you know, so different that it gets in the way of the other, you know what I mean? Speaker 6: Not that we've found. Speaker 5: Okay. So you've done testing around this? Speaker 6: We have done testing around it. I'm, you know, I'm, I don't know that we've hit every possible imaginable case, but yeah, we believe that that'll, that'll work fine. Speaker 5: And then tell me a little bit about the setup process. I know you mentioned that there's like acknowledgement that some things are going to look different. You're upgrading to Alexa Plus, but do you have to like re sign into some accounts? Do you have to like. You know, um, allow permissions again to different integrations, for example, or does it happen on a case by case basis when like, you know, everything that you've Speaker 6: done carries forward. So, for example, let me just give you a hardcore example. Some people have spent years setting up their smart home, you know, I bought a plug from this provider, I bought a light from that provider, etc. And the reason that customers love Alexa is it takes away all the complexity. I don't need to remember who built what device. I talk to them all just the same. One consistent interface for everything. [01:08:00] Uh, and we would never take that away. So that's a, you know, that's the kind of thing where we want customers to continue to benefit from all the, from everything that they've put together in their home, right? So, day one, they just advance to a new version of the way they interact with those things. They don't have to reset up anything. Speaker 5: And if you're adding a new service, for example, like you just signed up for, I don't know, Netflix for the first time, or Uber for the first time. Yeah, you would just Speaker 6: do that in the ways that you do it today. Gotcha. It's a little bit easier, frankly, because Alexa can walk you through those setups in many more cases. So you don't have to dig around in the Alexa app. You can just say, Alexa, I want to set up a streaming account with Hulu or something. In many cases, you get a QR code and it's just one simple tap. So Alexa can walk you through a bunch of that herself. We'd like to say, Alexa is an expert and now an expert on herself. Speaker 5: Yeah. Kind of, I mean, we're seeing this develop everywhere else in, you know, the consumer tech space, like with, you know, redesign Siri, for example, or like Gemini and all of that stuff. Where, where do [01:09:00] you see Amazon's generative AI ambitious playing out outside of Alexa? Speaker 6: Well, I think, I mean, you heard Andy talk about how much is going on at the company. Uh, I mean so much, right? And, you know, unbelievable and highly differentiated cloud services, Hardaware underlying that. Uh, and then on top of that, you know. Literally a thousand plus consumer applications of Gen AI, where Alexa is literally one of those. It's one, if you read the list, Alexa would say one, you know, Alexa plus is one of them. So it's a huge amount of work that we're doing. I think, I think our ambitions at Amazon are always just grounded in what we can do for customers though. Um, we've got consumer customers, we've got enterprise customers, we've got such a broad range of customer entertainment customers. Um, So, artists, authors, et cetera, you know the list, uh, uh, because, uh, we think there's a lot we can do. [01:10:00] Speaker 5: What is your favorite thing that Alexa Plus can do? Speaker 6: Uh, I showed some of them, frankly. I mean, I think if you ask Mara or Panos the same question, I think one of the ways we divided up our work today was to just say, well, what do we love to do? Like, what are the things that we actually do? Speaker 5: Panos with the ring camera thing. Yeah, he loves that. And you know, Speaker 6: he loves seeing his kids. He loves his dogs. When we saw the driver yesterday, he was like, Daniel, come in here. You know, where do you sit? See this? 'cause he'd been telling me about that driver and he hadn't had a ring footage as far as I know. Yeah. Uh, where we had seen that happen with Aries. But, um, so you're seeing some of the best I do, I do a lot of information exploration with Alexa. Okay. Um, I sit next to my, my, uh, teenage kids and do homework. Mm-hmm . Speaker 2: With Speaker 6: them. We do a lot of information exploration together just to, just as we're doing schoolwork together, we do. together. I've asked about, you know, I had forgotten the fundamental theorem of calculus, like how you would say it. Alexis got the fundamental theorem of calculus, I, you know, the fingertips for you. So, um, [01:11:00] there's a lot, there's a lot of that in my house, for sure. A lot of, we're getting excited for the baseball season coming. Uh, I mentioned, you know, like, like booking things and using some of these new integrations and open table and Uber and, you know, food and dinnertime is tricky at my house. My kids. It's Row Crew and they come home ravenous. So using Grubhub through Alexa with my, uh, Alexa app and it's in the tray on the way home. Uh, it's awesome. It's just super easy to just say what you want. Yeah. Last orders, it all comes up. So I think, I think you saw, I think you saw a lot of my favorite things today. Speaker 5: Yeah. We saw a lot of things on stage today. It was really hard to kind of imagine in my real world and what my favorite would be. Um, I know we're kind of close to time. I have so many like nitty gritty questions. And things like, you know. Um, they just flew out of my brain. You were talking, oh, the Ring camera stuff. Like, you know, it seems, I know it works only with Ring cameras, that video search feature, but it doesn't work with like, I know it doesn't work with Blink cameras just yet, but. Yeah, Speaker 6: it's with Ring, the smart [01:12:00] video search. Yeah, because you're also seeing, you're also seeing AI applied to the video sources, right? I think Alexa on stage might have even said, which we, which we've heard once before, I think say, I found with a husky. Speaker 5: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It has Speaker 6: learned. Speaker 5: Right. Speaker 6: Through video analysis that Ares is a husky. Speaker 5: Right, yeah. Speaker 6: So it's often. Could you Speaker 5: ascribe a name to the husky? Speaker 6: I think you could. I think panels could say, yep, that's Aries. Um, but I'm not sure we'd have to go. Speaker 5: We're kind of early days. So, I mean, we're going to wait. It's just, Speaker 6: it's just the beginning. It's a lot, but it's just the beginning. Speaker 5: And we'll end on this. How long has it been until like today since working on next gen or Luxor? Speaker 6: I mean, it takes to get to this point. You really need. Large language models to have reached the state of the art that they are at now. And then you've got tens of thousands of services and devices and capabilities integrated hundreds of experts in different areas, right? So it's been a big lift But you know a lot is dependent on [01:13:00] where we are with the state of the art in LLMs And I would say that we're there reasonably recently. Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 6: Yeah. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/engadget-podcast-iphone-16e-review-and-amazons-ai-powered-alexa-141518593.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Meme coins are not securities and, hence, aren&#39;t subject to federal laws regulating the financial instruments, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission . The agency has issued its official stance on meme coins, comparing them to collectibles, since their value is &quot;derived from speculative trading and the collective sentiment of the market.&quot; Meme coins do not fit the definition of securities under the law, SEC said, because they do &quot;not generate a yield or convey rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business.&quot; People who purchase them are also not considered to be investing in an enterprise, which means they&#39;re not &quot;investment contracts&quot; that are classified as securities.&nbsp; As such, people who sell and offer meme coins do not have to register their transactions with the commission under the Securities Act. Buyers are not protected by securities laws as a result, though that doesn&#39;t automatically mean that scammers can use them to dupe people without repercussions. Any fraudulent transaction involving meme coins could still be subject to enforcement action under other federal and state laws.&nbsp; The Trump administration&#39;s Securities and Exchange Commission has been showing signs of being friendlier towards the cryptocurrency industry ever since he took office. Just within this month, the SEC agreed to end an enforcement case that accused Coinbase of illegally running an unregistered securities exchange. The commission also dropped an investigation into Robinhood , which faced charges of violating securities laws with its crypto listings and sales. Even though the commission will not be regulating meme coins, it says it will still evaluate the &quot;economic realities&quot; of the presumably suspicious transactions they&#39;re involved in. Meme coins must be crypto assets &quot;inspired by internet memes, characters, current events, or trends&quot; purchased for &quot;entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes&quot; and whose value is &quot;driven primarily by market demand and speculation.&quot; They typically have &quot;limited or no use or functionality,&quot; the commission wrote, and &quot;experience significant market price volatility.&quot; Crypto assets labeled as &quot;meme coins&quot; in an effort to evade regulations will still be considered as securities if they don&#39;t fit that definition.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/sec-says-meme-coins-are-not-subject-to-federal-securities-laws-140032772.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Anyone who has rode the New York City subway can tell you that it has a lot of problems, from strange noises to flammable debris on the tracks. Now, as is the solution for everything these days, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is testing how AI could improve the repair process with the help of six Google Pixel phones.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the Google Pixel phones rode on four different subway cars between last September and January. The experiment, conducted in partnership with Google Public Sector , used the phone&#39;s accelerometers, magnetometers and microphones to pick up on any worrisome noises. This data was thn sent to cloud-based systems that generated predictive insights using machine learning algorithms.&nbsp; The tech, known by Google as TrackInspect, found 92 percent of the defect locations that inspectors located. &quot;By being able to detect early defects in the rails, it saves not just money but also time — for both crew members and riders&quot; New York City Transit President Demetrius Crichlow stated in a release . &quot;This innovative program — which is the first of its kind — uses AI technology to not only make the ride smoother for customers but also make track inspector’s jobs safer by equipping them with more advanced tools.&quot; Typically, inspectors walk all 665 miles of the subway tracks to find any issues, along with sensor-laden “train geometry cars&quot; picking up data three times a year. During the experiment, inspectors checked out any locations highlighted and confirmed whether there was a defect. They could also ask questions about maintenance and protocols through the tools generative AI system.&nbsp; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/mta-strapped-google-pixels-to-subway-cars-to-spot-track-defects-133046252.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amds-radeon-9070-and-9070-xt-are-gunning-for-nvidias-mid-range-throne-130016775.html?src=rss",
    "description": "AMD&#39;s decision to start off with midrange RDNA 4 GPUs now seems prescient. NVIDIA&#39;s high-end RTX 5090 and 5080 are already selling well beyond their absurdly high prices, if you can find any in stock at all. And while the RTX 5070 Ti impressed us, it&#39;s already selling for close to the 5080&#39;s $1,000 launch price. Now AMD&#39;s Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT, which are set to arrive on March 6, have the chance to swoop in and deliver some serious competition. Based on early briefings from AMD, which include some impressive benchmarks (still untested by us), the RDNA 4 GPUs appear to be compelling 4K and 1440p for discerning gamers who aren&#39;t ready to drop four figures on a video card. The Radeon 9070 starts at $549, but even more impressive, AMD managed to keep the 9070 XT at a very reasonable $599 launch price. Naturally, those prices will rise based on demand and the whims of card manufacturers, but they&#39;re still impressive compared to the RTX 5070 ($549 MSRP) and 5070 Ti ($749 MSRP). XFX On top of the usual raw performance upgrades, the major selling point for these new cards is AMD&#39;s Fidelity FX Super Resolution 4 (FSR4) upscaling technology. Unlike previous iterations, this time around it&#39;s powered by machine learning, similar to NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS. According to AMD, that allows for better image quality while upscaling from lower resolutions, as well as low latency and frame generation. AMD So what does that mean in action? AMD claims the 9070 XT can run Space Marine 2 at an average of 53 fps in 4K, but with FSR 4 running that jumps to 182 fps. That&#39;s similar to the leap in performance we&#39;ve seen on NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 50-series GPUs, which can generate multiple frames. FSR 4 is supported on more than 30 titles at the moment, but for other games like Star Citizen and Forza Horizon 5 , AMD claims its HYPR-RX driver-level upscaler can also improve performance by up to 3X. While both the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT come with 16GB of VRAM (unlike the 12GB the RTX 5070 is stuck with), the latter card will likely do a better job driving 4K 240Hz screens. The 9070 XT sports 64 RDNA 4 compute units, 64 hardware ray tracing accelerators and 128 hardware AI accelerators, while the 9070 includes 56 compute units and RT accelerators, as well as 112 AI units. The 9070 XT can also draw significantly more power — 304 watts instead of 220W — and has more than a 500MHz boost clock lead. The standard 9070 will likely be better suited for players who game in 1440p most of the time, but who may occasionally dabble in 4K. AMD Curiously, most of AMD&#39;s benchmarks compare the new cards to the $549 RX 7900 GRE , a slightly under-specced card originally meant for China. But the company did make a handful of comparisons to other cards: For one, it claims the RX 9070 XT is on average 51 percent faster than the Radeon 6900 XT across 30 games while playing in 4K with maximum graphics settings. It&#39;s also reportedly 26 percent faster than the RTX 3090 across those same 30 games. As for the RX 9070, AMD says it&#39;s 38 percent in 4K/max settings than the RX 6800 XT and 26 percent faster than the RTX 3080. Surely AMD could have compared these cards to the RTX 40 lineup and newer Radeons, but then those gains wouldn&#39;t be as high. AMD Beyond gaming, AMD says its new RDNA 4 media engine will be able to encode H.264 with better image quality, and it&#39;ll support up to 8K/80fps encoding and decoding. As for AI, the 9070 XT is 34 percent faster than the RX 7900 GRE while using Davinci Resolve&#39;s Magic Mask Tracking Tool, and it&#39;s 70 percent faster while using Procyon SD XL for generative AI. If AMD can manage to keep the Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT in stock, and also hold prices close to their $549 and $599 launch figures, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some NVIDIA diehards jump ship. And if you&#39;re looking for something even cheaper, AMD says its RX 9060 cards will be coming in the second quarter.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-engadget-newsletter-121514554.html?src=rss",
    "description": "First up, an apology. In Tuesday’s newsletter, I laid out how to watch (and what to expect from) Amazon’s Alexa press event. But aside from unveiling what Alexa+ will be capable of, there was no silly hardware and no upgraded Echos, but lots of demos . We learned Alexa+ will be included with an Amazon Prime subscription, and the company will also offer the enhanced digital assistant separately, for $20 per month. At the moment, Prime costs $15 per month in the US. So that&#39;s weird. Meanwhile, Apple’s new entry-level iPhone, the 16e , launches online and in stores today. The $599 phone is arguably $100 too expensive , but it packs a processor that can deliver Apple Intelligence to the masses. It has a gorgeous screen, with a notch — if not a Dynamic Island — and a long battery life. Thanks to that A18 chip, it is as powerful as iPhones, which cost several hundred dollars more. This is a phone for people who don’t upgrade every year (or two). If you’re coming from an older iPhone, say an iPhone 11 (like my mom), you’ll be treated to a brighter screen, improved image processing and, heck, 5G. Apple says the newer process will ensure the 16e is 80 percent faster than the iPhone 11. You are going to see the difference. Oh, and you get an action button. Our biggest concern is the single-camera situation. It’s a great camera, but we already miss the versatility of optical zoom that goes beyond the digital cropping that the iPhone 16e uses. Check out our full review right here. And if you’re OK not staying with an iPhone, we’re moving into the mid-range smartphone season — so stay tuned. — Mat Smith How to get MagSafe charging on an iPhone 16e A $599 iPhone 16e is a cruel joke The biggest tech stories you missed Everything announced at Amazon’s Alexa+ AI event EA releases source code for four Command &amp; Conquer games The best laptop you can buy in 2025 Gmail will stop using SMS for two-factor authentication Get this delivered directly to your inbox. Subscribe right here! What to expect from Samsung, Nothing, Xiaomi and more at MWC 2025 Nothing’s new devices might be the headline grabbers. Nothing The world’s biggest smartphone event (after iPhone launches, let’s be real) returns to Barcelona. While it’s no longer the heyday of Mobile World Congress, smartphone challengers from China love to reveal technically accomplished devices, and we’re expecting delights from the likes of Xiaomi, Honor, Huawei et al. Except maybe not Oppo — it’s done its thing already. At MWC 2022, Nothing’s Carl Pei showed off a prototype of the company’s first handset, the Nothing Phone 1. It looks like it’s ready to reveal its third-gen phone, with the company’s usual drip-drip of specs, features and hyperbole already in action. Nothing already revealed the design of one phone, the 3a Pro, in a nearly 11-minute video. Notably, a big ole camera bump to accommodate a periscope telephoto lens. Xiaomi is also teasing some heady camera hardware: Its 15 Ultra will be a photography powerhouse, rumored to pack a 1-inch main sensor and 200-megapixel periscope telephoto lens. Will Samsung show off the slimline Galaxy S25 Edge ? Perhaps. It might also be time to reveal an update to its A-series mid-range devices. Perhaps the company will do both. Continue reading. Sony cuts the price of PS VR2 to $400 Add the price of your PS5 too. Engadget Sony is permanently reducing the price of the PlayStation VR2. Starting in March, the headset will cost $400, down from $500. It still costs more than the Meta Quest 3S, a standalone headset, but is obviously capable of a richer graphic experience. That said, where are the AAA games? Even Sony’s own PS VR2 website struggles to offer anything particularly exciting. Continue reading. You’re never finding those lost wireless earbuds It’s time to let go. I have misplaced my Beats Fit Pro buds . Wherever I set them down, I recall thinking, “you’re going to regret not putting them back into the charging case.” And I was right. Two weeks on, I have the charging case, open and ready, but the buds have been translocated to another dimension. I tried Apple’s Find My app, which says they’re somewhere in my apartment. That doesn’t help me enough. I use them for workouts, so I checked jacket pockets, gym shorts, the bathroom, windows, the sides of my couch and even my inner ear canal. But no. I have held out hope for two weeks, but it’s time for me to let go. Fortunately, I work here , so I have three standby options for gym listening. But they didn’t fit as well as the Beats Fit Pro. I will hold onto the charging case, just in case they magically appear in my detergent box or somewhere else completely arbitrary, but mentally, I know I will never find them again. Goodbye, my waxy, sweaty buds of joy. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-engadget-newsletter-121514554.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Whether you want to back up the data on your PC, transfer videos from your Mac or offload a few games from your PlayStation 5, a portable SSD is a quick and easy way to expand your storage. These little bricks may cost more than traditional hard drives, but they’re significantly faster, lighter and more reliable. Figuring out the best portable SSD for you, though, isn’t as simple as just picking the one with the lowest price or the most space. (Well, it can be, but that wouldn’t be very efficient.) To help, we’ve weeded through the portable SSD market, tested a bunch of contenders and sorted out which ones offer the most value. You can find our top picks below, plus an overview of what to know before you buy. Table of contents Best external SSDs for 2025 Other external SSDs we tested What to consider before buying an external SSD How we test external SSDs Recent updates Best external SSDs for 2025 Other external SSDs we tested The pre-built OWC Express 1M2 is a premium-feeling USB4 SSD that’s roughly as fast as the ADATA SE920, but it’s larger and significantly more expensive as of this writing. If you’re in the relatively small group with a PC that supports USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but not Thunderbolt or USB4, the Crucial X10 Pro is essentially a faster version of our top pick. The Lexar SL600 is a larger but slightly quicker option, while the Lexar SL500 , Kingston XS2000 or Samsung T9 could also work if you see them on discount. As a reminder, though, drives like these are aimed primarily at content creators and other professionals, and you have to make sure you won’t upgrade to a device with a faster USB interface anytime soon. The Samsung T7 Shield has a conveniently rugged design with a rubberized, IP65-rated shell. It also comes with both USB-C and USB-A cables. But it was consistently slower than the X9 Pro and XS1000 in our benchmark tests, plus it has a shorter three-year warranty. The Silicon Power PX10 is an especially affordable USB 3.2 Gen 2 model. Its peak speeds weren’t too far off the X9 Pro or XS1000 in synthetic benchmarks, but it can get distractingly hot and its sustained writes are markedly worse. It took 50 seconds longer to move our 70GB custom test folder to this drive compared to the X9 Pro, for example. The Crucial X6 is another low-cost option that’s a good bit slower than our top picks. It’s limited to a three-year warranty and lacks an IP rating as well. It’s not a terrible option for the basics, but there’s little reason to get it over the XS1000 when their prices are similar. The OWC Envoy Pro FX is well-built and supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.2 Gen 2, but it’s a smidge slower than the SE920 and Express 1M2, and it’s much pricier than the former. The Samsung T9 portable SSD. Samsung What to consider before buying an external SSD Capacity The first thing to figure out before buying a portable SSD is just how much storage space you need. Most of the drives we considered for this guide are available in capacities ranging from one to four terabytes, though plenty of smaller and larger options exist. There’s no hard-and-fast rule for which size is “best” — that’ll ultimately depend on your budget and what exactly you’re looking to stash. But in general, it’s better to overcompensate than underdo it. Nobody wants to be forced into buying a second drive because they filled the first one up too quickly. If you’re backing up a PC, a good rule of thumb is to buy an external SSD with twice as much space as your computer’s internal storage. This way, you can save at least one full backup while also having room for additional data. If you want to store a bunch of PlayStation or Xbox games with huge install sizes, you may need more space. If you just want to back up a small collection of files, you may be better off saving your cash and just getting a smaller USB flash drive instead, which aren’t quite the same as the external SSDs we tested for this guide. Price In general, you get a better price-per-gigabyte ratio the further you go up the capacity ladder. As of this writing, the 1TB Samsung T9 is priced at $130, or $0.13 per gigabyte (GB), while the 4TB version is available for $297 or $0.07 per GB. That technically makes the larger model a better “value,” but not everyone needs to pay that much more upfront. SSDs in the same speed class tend to not vary too wildly in terms of performance, so part of our decision-making for this guide came down to which ones are often the cheapest. But prices can fluctuate over time; if you see that one of our top picks is priced way higher than a comparable honorable mention, feel free to get the latter. At this point in time, costs are broadly trending upwards. The ADATA SE920 portable SSD connected to an Apple MacBook Pro. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Speed and USB interface Just about all external SSDs are significantly faster than mechanical hard disk drives (HDDs), so you’ll save time waiting for files to transfer and games to load no matter what. Within the market, however, there are distinct performance tiers. These are defined in large part by the USB interface a drive supports. While all of the SSDs we considered for this guide can connect over USB-C, some USB-C connections can supply faster transfer speeds than others. Sorting through this can get real confusing real fast, so we’ll try to put it in simple terms. You can essentially divide today’s crop of portable SSDs into different segments. At the very top are drives that utilize the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 standard, which has a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 80 gigabits per second (Gbps). (You may see it advertise speeds up to 120 Gbps, but that boost doesn’t apply to storage devices.) But portable SSDs that support this tech only just started to trickle out toward the end of 2024, and the market for devices with Thunderbolt 5 ports is still fairly limited , with the most notable exceptions being Apple’s top-end Macs with an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip. Thunderbolt 5 is built on a spec called USB4 , which can technically reach up to 80 Gbps as well but is more typically available in a flavor that tops out at 40 Gbps. Portable SSDs based on that standard started to roll out toward the end of 2023 but are still relatively infrequent. The older Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4, which other high-end external SSDs continue to use, support the same 40 Gbps maximum. A third version of USB4, meanwhile, maxes at 20 Gbps, as does an older yet more frequently used standard called USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. Below that is USB 3.2 Gen 2, which maxes at 10 Gbps. Then there’s USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is capped at 5 Gbps. Lastly, we’ll bundle together SSDs that use older standards and aren’t worth considering here. To make this easy: For everyday folks, a good USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive is the sweet spot between fast-enough performance, wide-enough compatibility and cheap-enough price, so those make up our primary recommendations above. If you work in a creative field or don’t mind paying extra to shave seconds off your large file transfers, though, a “higher-tier” model would make sense. However, note that actual computers that utilize USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 aren’t super common — no Mac supports it, for one — and the interface is effectively being replaced by USB4. In general, your chain is only as strong as its weakest link: If your computer only has USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, for example, you could still use a Thunderbolt SSD, but you won’t get beyond Gen 2 speeds. Make sure you know what you’re working with before you buy. As a refresher, storage devices are broadly measured in terms of read and write speeds. The former refers to how long it takes to access something from the drive; the latter, how long it takes to save something to it. From there, you can break these metrics into sequential and random performance. Sequential speeds tend to matter more with portable SSDs, since most people use them to save or access long, constant streams of data such as a bunch of high-res photos. Random speeds would be important if you want to run video games off the drive, since that’d involve reading and writing smaller, more scattered files. Either way, how well an SSD can sustain its performance with extended use is also critical. Other performance factors and enclosures A modern portable SSD’s speeds aren’t just about its USB interface, though. Its performance can also depend on how advanced its controller is, whether it has a native USB flash controller or a separate bridge chip to communicate with a host device, the kind and quality of NAND flash memory it uses, whether it has a DRAM cache or it’s DRAM-less, and more. We’re simplifying things, but here are some quick tips: Drives with triple-level cell (TLC) memory aren’t as cheap as quad-level cell (QLC) SSDs, but they’re generally more reliable and they offer better write performance. Having a dedicated DRAM cache helps if you plan to hit your drive with more intense, sustained workloads, but may not be worth the extra cost for most people. Some models with native flash controllers may not perform as well as those with a bridging chip, depending on the SSD inside, but they typically draw less heat and are physically smaller. All of this is to say that an external SSD’s speeds aren’t quite as straightforward as what the manufacturer chooses to advertise on the box. It’s also worth remembering that you can turn an internal SSD into a portable solution with a good enclosure . If you have a spare drive and don’t mind going the DIY route, this can be a cheaper and more flexible solution, though we’ve stuck to pre-built models for this guide for the sake of simplicity. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Size, durability, endurance and warranty Most portable SSDs are impressively small and light, so they won’t be difficult to tuck in a bag (or even a pocket) and take on the go. We note above if any drive is bulkier than usual. Nothing we’re talking about matters if your drive can’t last in the long term. It’s hard to definitively say which external SSDs are the most reliable, but we scoured through user reviews and feedback while researching this guide to ensure none of our picks show a pattern of catastrophic errors. If there was too much smoke around a particular model, we steered clear. We ruled out certain drives from SanDisk and Western Digital, for instance, after reports from Ars Technica and The Verge &nbsp; noted an issue that led to data loss (and lawsuits ) in 2023. That said, one of the big reasons you’d buy an SSD in general is its superior durability. Because it has no moving mechanical parts inside, an SSD has far fewer avenues to failure than an external hard drive. You still don’t want to be careless with them, but an accidental drop shouldn’t be the end of the world. Some portable SSDs build on this inherent ruggedness with plastic or rubberized casings and more robust waterproofing. These aren’t necessary for everyone, but if you’re a frequent traveler or someone who often works outdoors, there are options for you. Still, all drives can fail. If you have any sort of data you’d be distraught to lose, you should back it up regularly, then make a second backup, ideally with a cloud service. Along those protective lines, we also took note of the warranty policy for each drive we tested. Just about all of them are backed for either three or five years; of course, longer is better. Encryption and software It’s not uncommon to store sensitive data on a portable SSD, so some models offer extra security features like hardware-based encryption — i.e., direct scrambling of data stored on the drive itself — built-in keypads and fingerprint readers to protect against unauthorized access if the drive is lost or stolen. While not top requirements, perks like these are certainly good to have. Some SSDs also come with companion software to further manage the drive. The best of those can be handy to have around, but we wouldn’t call them essential. How we test external SSDs Unfortunately, we did not have access to a device that can make full use of USB 3.2 Gen 2, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 and Thunderbolt/USB4 speeds interchangeably, so we had to split our testing across multiple devices, including an M1 Pro MacBook Pro and an Alienware gaming PC running Windows 11. Because of this, we primarily compared the portable SSDs within each “class” against one another. Before switching OSes, we reformatted each drive to each platform’s standard file system format: APFS for macOS and NTFS for Windows. After researching which SSDs had enough positive feedback to be worth testing in the first place, we put 13 drives through a range of synthetic and “real-world” benchmark tests. On Windows, these included CrystalDiskMark , PCMark 10 ’s Data Drive Benchmark and 3DMark ’s gaming-focused Storage Benchmark. On macOS, we used AmorphousDiskMark (effectively a Mac version of CrystalDiskMark), BlackMagic Disk Speed Test and ATTO Disk Benchmark . We also timed how long it took for each drive to read and write a custom 70GB folder filled with roughly 11,500 different files, including photos, videos, music files, PDFs and other large and small data types scattered across numerous subfolders. We performed multiple passes for each test to avoid irregularities, and we kept track of each SSD’s heat levels over the course of the whole suite. Our process wasn't a perfect science, but it gave us a general sense of how each drive compares to other models in its price and performance range. Recent updates February 2025 : We’ve checked to ensure the pricing info and links in this guide are still accurate. We’ve also added details on the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 interface, which has been implemented in a couple recent portable SSDs like the OWC Envoy Ultra and LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5 . We’ll look to include testing notes for those for our next update, as they should be faster than the ADATA SE920, our current premium pick, albeit for a much higher price. For now, though, our top picks remain the same. October 2024 : We’ve taken a sweep through this guide to ensure all pricing and availability info is still correct. Our recommendations are unchanged.

    "description": "Finding good laptops can feel overwhelming, especially with so many options to choose from. Whether you need a lightweight machine for work, a business laptop for productivity, or something with plenty of storage for all of your projects, there are plenty of options. Modern laptops are more powerful and efficient than ever, offering a mix of portability, performance, and features tailored to different needs. From sleek ultrabooks to gaming beasts and budget-friendly options, there's no shortage of great choices. Out of all of the notebooks we've tested and reviewed recently, we consider Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air M3 to be the best laptop for most people, and this is still the case for our top picks to start off the new year. It's powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last around 20 hours (depending on what you're doing, of course). The MacBook Air M3 is also one of the lightest and thinnest systems we've reviewed, and it's dead silent, thanks to a fanless design. While Apple has debuted its new M4 chip in the recent iPad Pro, we may not see it in the MacBook Air until next year. For now, the MacBook Air M3 is still an excellent laptop to buy, particularly if you need a machine with good battery life. Of course, not everyone wants a MacBook, and there are excellent Windows laptops and Chromebooks out there, too. Windows systems offer a range of configurations, from budget to high-end UHD screens with stunning IPS panels that boast high nits for vivid brightness. Chromebooks, on the other hand, tend to be more affordable and are great for users who mostly work online. Whether you need a powerhouse for creative work, a compact system for note-taking, or a laptop that can handle family movie night, there’s something for everyone in today’s laptop market. Table of contents Best laptops of 2025 How we test and pick laptops Factors to consider when choosing a laptop Best laptops specs comparison chart Other laptops we’ve tested Laptop FAQs Recent updates Best laptops of 2025 Back to top How we test laptops Engadget has been reviewing laptops for two decades , and while the definition of what a portable PC is has changed considerably since, our obsession with testing their limits and serving up informative buying advice remains the same. Be it a hybrid tablet like Microsoft's Surface machines, a rotating 2-in-1 convertible like HP's Spectre x360s or a plain old clamshell notebook, our review process follows similar beats. How does it look and feel? How fast is it? Whether it’s a Windows device powered by an Intel Core i5 or higher, a MacBook or a Chromebook, we aim to answer the most important question: Is it actually worth your hard-earned cash? We also pay close attention to portability, webcam quality and display features, including IPS panels and nits of brightness, as they can make a big difference in daily use. Back to top Factors to consider when choosing a laptop Price You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a new laptop these days, depending on the configuration. If you're looking for more of a workhorse, that could cost you well over $2,000 for additional RAM, storage, as well as a beefier graphics card and CPU. But you can also find some good laptops under $1,000 if you're willing to overlook build quality (or buy a refurbished or previous generation machine, which we highly recommend). Systems with AMD chips tend to come in cheaper than their Intel counterparts, but the bulk of their cost will come down to other components like RAM and storage. I’ve included our favorite affordable model in this best laptop buying guide, but we have a list of the best budget laptops that you can check out as well. Operating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS There's a good chance you've already committed to an operating system, but my advice is to be as flexible as possible. These days, most major software is compatible with both Macs and PCs. (Of course, it's another story if you've become dependent on an Apple-only app like Final Cut Pro.) Web-based apps, naturally, will work on any platform with an internet browser. If you're an Apple-loyalist, there aren't many reasons to consider Windows laptops (unless you want a secondary gaming machine). But for Windows users, macOS is becoming more tempting every year. Apple's MacBooks , powered by its M-series Silicon chips, are among the fastest and most efficient laptops we've ever seen. They're incredibly well-built and have outstanding battery life to boot. MacOS itself is also an easy platform to learn, especially if you're used to iOS and iPadOS. That brings up another point: iPhone users may want to consider Macs because of the seamless integration with Apple's other platforms. You can't respond to iMessage conversations easily or hop into FaceTime chats on Windows PCs, but doing so is simple on Macs. ( Microsoft's Phone Link app lets you send iOS users individual texts, but not media or group chats.) Android users, meanwhile, may be better off with Windows, as Phone Link can make calls, synchronize all your texts and also access your phone's photos. If cloud gaming is your priority, Windows laptops with NVIDIA’s GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming compatibility may offer more flexibility and decent performance, especially when paired with fast internet speeds. Chromebooks also make a compelling case here as an affordable, lightweight solution for casual cloud gaming sessions. As for whether you’ll want a PC with a dedicated Copilot AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsoft’s generative tools. Given we’re only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time. And what about ChromeOS? Chromebooks are a smart and (typically) inexpensive way to do things like web browsing and hopping on a few video chats, but for most, they're not the best choice as a primary computer. There aren't many apps or games that work offline, and they also don't work with powerful software suites like Adobe's (you can use the stripped-down Adobe Express and Photoshop online tools , though). Chromebooks are great secondary machines to use alongside a more powerful Mac or PC, and they're popular in schools because they're cheap and easy for IT workers to manage. And if all you need is web browsing access, or a notebook for a kid, a Chromebook might be enough. If, for some reason, you’re looking for a powerful ChromeOS system, there are also Chromebook Plus models to consider. These machines sport faster processors and more RAM than typical Google notebooks, and they can also tap into a few of the company’s online AI features , like AI image generation and photo processing. Ports and connectivity These days, most laptops ship with a few USB-C ports, which can handle both charging and speedy data transfers. Apple's MacBooks also include a separate connection for MagSafe power, and you'll find custom power connections on some PCs like Microsoft's Surface. Older USB Type-A connections are less common now, but they still pop up in systems like HP's Spectre x360 14 , as well as many models from ASUS. For gamers or creators who rely on discrete graphics, ensuring your laptop has the right ports for external monitors or GPUs is crucial. DisplayPort or HDMI connections can also ensure you’re ready for dual- or multi-screen setups for more immersive experiences. Similarly, if you want to save high-resolution files or install multiple games, you might need to consider additional hard drive space; external hard drives are pretty affordable, as long as you have a proper port to connect them. If you're a fan of wired headphones, it's worth keeping a close eye on headphone jack availability. Many lightweight laptops, like Dell's XPS 13, don’t have the 3.5mm socket entirely. They usually include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, but that's a clunky solution, and it also takes up a USB port. Sure, most people use wireless earbuds and cans today, but it's still helpful to have a wired one around for when those devices run out of juice. Most laptops today offer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible routers and devices. While Wi-Fi 7 routers have started appearing, that spec hasn't made its way into laptops yet. As for cellular coverage, there are notebooks like the Surface Pro 9 and Samsung Galaxy Book models that offer integrated 5G. But from our testing, that feature may not be worth the cost of a separate data plan. Instead, you could tether to your smartphone or invest in a wireless hotspot that can keep multiple devices online. Laptop size and weight So how portable do you want your laptop to be? That's the ultimate question you need to ask when choosing between various screen sizes. 13-inch machines have become a solid starting point for most shoppers — it's enough real estate for the majority of tasks like emailing and writing, and it also helps keep machines relatively light (typically between two to three pounds). Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display). If you have trouble seeing fine text, we’d recommend going for a display larger than 13 inches. ASUS’s Zephyrus G14 is a solid 14-inch option for gamers, and we’re also seeing more productivity-focused machines aim for that size, like the XPS 14 and MacBook Pro. While 14-inch notebooks are a bit heavier than 13-inch models, coming in between three to four pounds, their screens are noticeably roomier. For artists, or anyone else who needs a large canvas, a 15-inch laptop may make the most sense. They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. And, as you'd expect, you'll also pay a bit more for a 15-inch notebook compared to smaller ones (the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,299, while the smaller model goes for $999). PC makers are also replacing 15-inch systems with 16-inch versions, which will give you even more space to work. If you're in the market for a business laptop, size and portability might be key considerations. A lightweight yet powerful system with a long battery life can make a world of difference if you travel frequently for work. You can still find laptops with 17-inch or 18-inch screens, but those are typically gaming systems or souped-up workstations. They're not meant for mere computing mortals. Battery life A laptop's battery life depends on several factors: The power draw from the screen and other hardware, the optimizations used to avoid unnecessary power drain, and, of course, the size of the actual battery. One of our favorite systems, the Dell XPS 13, lasted 13 hours and 15 minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In real-world testing, I was able to use it for a day and a half without needing a recharge. The MacBook Air 13-inch, meanwhile, lasted 20 hours in our benchmark and kept running for more than two work days of my typical workflow. In general, you should expect a modern laptop to last at least eight hours. If battery life is your absolute priority, I'd strongly suggest looking at Macs over Windows PCs. Apple's M-series chips are essentially mobile hardware, with all of the power efficiency you'd expect from something originally designed for phones. Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon chips could help Windows PCs compete with Apple’s astonishing battery life, but we’ve yet to see those in action. Chromebooks also typically get decent battery life (as long as you don’t overstuff them with power-draining tabs). Refresh rate A laptop's refresh rate refers to the amount of times its screen is cycled every second. Modern displays like IPS LCDs and OLEDs support 60Hz refresh rates at a minimum, but we're seeing more devices offering 120Hz, 240Hz and beyond. The higher the number, the faster the screen is refreshed, which ultimately leads to a smoother experience while mousing around or scrolling through web pages. (If you want to get a sense of what a slow refresh rate looks like, just grab an e-reader like the Kindle and try to flip between book pages.) While high refresh rates used to be reserved for gaming laptops, nowadays we're seeing more mainstream machines like the XPS 13 offer 120Hz (or variable rates that move between 60Hz and 120Hz). If there's one knock against the MacBook Air, it's that it's still stuck at 60Hz. CPU If you’re buying a new laptop, you’ll want to make sure it’s powered by the latest CPUs. For Windows PCs, that includes Intel’s Core Ultra chips for thin-and-light machines or the 14th-gen HX chips for beefier systems. The Core Ultra series have NPUs for handling AI tasks, while the HX hardware does not – they’re based on Intel’s previous chip architecture, and they’re more focused on delivering raw horsepower. Intel's older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don't have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you're looking at used systems. You'll also see AMD's Ryzen 8000 and 9000 chips in plenty of new systems like the ASUS Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you'll still find AMD’s older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. AMD's main advantage is that its chips also include Radeon graphics, which are far more capable than Intel's Arc hardware (though those are getting better). Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are also an option in Copilot+ PCs (more on those below). Since they’re based on mobile chip designs, they’re likely also more power efficient than AMD and Intel’s hardware. In the past, we’ve avoided recommending Snapdragon chips because they led to a slow and frustrating Windows experience. But Microsoft claims it’s rebuilt Windows 11 around Snapdragon’s Arm-based architecture , which should lead to far faster performance and better app compatibility. As for Apple's laptops, you'll be choosing between the M3, M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max, each of which is progressively more powerful. Apple is also keeping its older M2 chip around for the MacBook Air, which is still a solid performer for the price. GPU A GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the component that communicates directly with a laptop's display. Laptop CPUs all have some form of integrated GPU: Intel has either its standard graphics or beefier Arc hardware, while AMD's chips include fast Radeon mobile graphics. If you want to play demanding games at high speeds (measured in frames per second, or fps), or if you need some extra power for rendering video or 3D models, you can configure a laptop with a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA's RTX 40-series hardware or AMD's Radeon RX 7000. Just be sure to leave room in your budget if you want a powerful GPU, as they typically add $300 or more to the cost of a laptop. Apple's M-series chips, meanwhile, have GPU cores that can perform as well as NVIDIA’s and AMD's lower-end dedicated GPUs. That's quite the accomplishment for systems like this (especially the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro), and it's another reason we highly recommend Apple's notebooks. AI PCs, NPUs and Copilot+ Simply put, an AI PC is a computer equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle AI-related tasks. Much like how GPUs tackle heavy-duty gaming and rendering workloads, NPUs are designed to handle the complex math necessary for AI workloads. They’re also far more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs, which could lead to better battery performance in laptops. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second). We were primed for AI PCs based on the chips Intel and AMD announced in 2023. Intel unveiled its \"Core Ultra\" CPUs in December, its first to include an NPU for AI work. AMD also announced its Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips that month (and it couldn't help but say they were faster than Intel's new hardware). But in May, Microsoft announced its Copilot+ initiative , which is pushing major PC makers to deliver premium AI PCs with specifications including 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSDs and NPUs with at least 40 TOPS of AI performance. Copilot+ is more than just a marketing term: Microsoft is also launching AI-powered features in Windows 11 that take advantage of powerful NPUs. That includes Recall , which can help you locate anything you’ve done on your PC (whenever it finally launches), as well as Cocreator in Paint , which can generate AI images based on text prompts and doodles. If you buy an AI PC that isn’t Copilot+ certified, you’ll still be able to use some features like Windows Studio Effects, which can blur your background in video calls or keep you in frame. Developers like Adobe and Audacity are also building features into their apps that can take advantage of NPUs. At the time of this post, Chromebook Plus notebooks can also access a few of Google’s online AI features, like image generation and photo processing. Back to top Other laptops we tested that didn't make the cut Apple 15-inch MacBook Air M3 This Apple laptop is just a larger version of the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air. It's still quite portable at 3.3 pounds, and some will appreciating having just a tad more screen real estate all the time. Configuration options are the same as well; you can spec out the 15-inch Air with up to 24GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. But considering it starts off $200 more than the smaller model, it's primarily best for those who absolutely need a larger screen and are willing to pay for it. ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED Aside from its lovely OLED screen, the ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED doesn't stand out from the crowded laptop field in any way. It just looks dull and boring, especially compared to the strikingly beautiful ASUS Zephyrus G14, which also came out this year. While you can probably find the Zenbook 14 for a decent price, I'd recommend holding out for something with a bit more personality (and with a less wobbly screen hinge). Razer Blade 14 The Razer Blade has almost everything you'd want in a 14-inch gaming notebook, but it's far pricier than the Zephyrus G14 on this list, and it doesn’t even have an SD card reader. It would be a solid competitor once its price falls a bit, and it's certainly a great option if you just have to have a jet-black laptop. Framework Laptop 16 Framework gave its modularity magic to the Laptop 16 , delivering a gaming notebook where almost every single component is user replaceable. But you'll have to pay a pretty penny to snag it with upgraded hardware, and its optional Radeon 7700S GPU was surprisingly slow. Alienware m16 R2 The Alienware m16 r2 has been revamped with a slimmer case, but it’s otherwise a fairly typical gaming laptop. It’s a solid option for Alienware fans, but you’ll find better hardware and deals elsewhere. ASUS Zenbook Duo (2024) The Zenbook Duo is a fascinating dual-screened notebook, and according to my colleague Sam Rutherford it’s the first of its kind that’s worth buying. But its unique hardware isn’t really meant for mainstream consumers, and Windows 11 still doesn’t support multi-screen setups well enough to make full use of the Zenbook Duo’s ample canvas. Dell XPS 16 Dell’s XPS 16 is big and beautiful, but it’s far too expensive compared to the competition. Plus, it uses a capacitive row of function keys that you basically can’t see under bright light and has too few ports for a machine of this size.

It’s hard to come up with an average battery life for laptops, since that will ultimately depend on what you’re doing with them. An ultraportable like the MacBook Air that sips power can last around 20 hours in our battery benchmark, and around two full work days of real-world usage. But a gaming laptop may last only a few hours if you’re actively playing something while on battery. At this point, Macs are delivering far better battery life than PCs, thanks to Apple’s Silicon chips, but Microsoft claims Copilot+ systems with Qualcomm chips will also get over 20 hours of batter life. How much RAM do I really need? The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do simultaneously. For that reason, we recommend buying PCs and Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. That gives you enough memory to have several applications open at once, as well as web browsers filled with RAM-hogging tabs. Many PC games also require at least 16GB of RAM. While you could use a system with 8GB of RAM for basic tasks, you’ll quickly run into slowdowns and error messages as your apps stack up. Many laptops, especially ultraportables, don’t let you upgrade RAM, too – so you’ll have to buy an entirely new computer if you didn’t equip enough memory at the start. If you’re a hardcore gamer, programmer or planning to render videos or 3D models, then you may want to go for 32GB of RAM or more. And if you just need a secondary laptop for lighter work – perhaps a no-frills system for writing – then you can probably get by with 8GB. Just be sure to keep those browser tabs in check. What is the best storage capacity for a laptop? There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. You’ll typically find configurations between 256GB and 1TB SSDs (solid state drives) on most laptops, and I’d recommend most people get at least 512GB. That’ll be enough space for large apps, music and video files without stressing your system too much. If you’re a media hoarder, or want to play a ton of games, then it’s definitely worth getting a 1TB SSD. If you’ll mainly be streaming your shows and music, and would rather invest in RAM or other hardware, then 256GB of storage would be serviceable. I’d recommend staying away from any machine with 128GB of storage though. Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and you’ll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months. We recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable SSD for backing up your most important files. It's also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since ChromeOS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on the device. In that case, 128GB is plenty. What's a good price range for a decent laptop in 2025? You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a typical 13-inch laptop today. As I explained above, you'll pay more if you want to stuff in more RAM or better GPU hardware. But you can also find deals below $1,000 if you look for refurbished or older-generation models. What’s the difference between macOS and Windows? Which is better? Simply put, macOS is the operating system in all of Apple's notebooks and desktops, while Windows powers the vast majority of PCs. You'll also find Chromebooks running Google's ChromeOS, but those are basically just web browsers running on top of Linux. Debating the differences between Windows and Macs is something PC nerds have been doing since the '80s, so we won't be declaring a winner here. There are some small, negligible distinctions, like using a Command versus a Control key, how file explorers work and concerns about viruses and security. For the most part, those are minor issues or have become moot thanks to better built-in security. But if you care more about playing the newest games, you'll want to have a Windows system. If you're more focused on creative apps, like Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro, then macOS may be a better fit (especially if you're running an iPhone). What are the best laptop brands? There is no single \"best\" laptop brand, but judging from this guide alone, we're generally impressed by notebooks from Apple, Dell and ASUS. They all offer fast, reliable and sturdy machines. HP also makes some eye-catching devices if you want an option that’s the most aesthetic. Those four brands, along with Lenovo and Acer, dominate laptop sales worldwide . We'd avoid systems from any retail store brands, or companies that don't have a major presence in the US.

    "description": "Microsoft is making its Copilot AI assistant available as a Mac app. The native macOS app will offer access to the web-based version of the Microsoft tool. It's rolling out today in the US, the UK and Canada. In practice, the apps functionalities sound pretty much identical to the experience of going to the web version of Copilot. The real distinction is that the Mac app includes a keyboard shortcut for activating the AI assistant with Command + Space and it can be viewed in dark mode. Earlier this week, Microsoft announced that it would make the Copilot features Voice and Think Deeper, which taps into OpenAI's o1 model , available to any users for free. Both moves seems aimed at broadening the company's audience for Copilot. Big tech companies have a rocky history of trying to make their software available on rival hardware. Sometimes, it can take years for a service to be optimized for a different brand's exact specs. The arrival of a dedicated macOS app for Copilot, which is already out as an iPhone and iPad app, might be about as quick as Microsoft has ever brought a service to the Apple ecosystem.

    "description": "Gaming accessory maker CRKD and Gibson have teamed up to revive the guitar controller in the form of two Gibson Les Paul-shaped controllers that will let you play your way through Fortnite Festival , Clone Hero , and even Rock Band 4. The Gibson Les Paul Black Tribal Encore Edition Guitar Controller and Gibson Les Paul Blueberry Burst Pro Edition Guitar Controller featured the whammy bar and colored frets from older gaming guitars, updated to work with modern platforms. CRKD is making both multi-platform and Xbox specific versions of the guitars, and depending on whether you pick the Encore or Pro Edition model, you'll get a slightly different set of features.&nbsp; CRKD The Pro Edition includes frets that have been \"engineered for unmatched precision and responsiveness,\" along with a Hall-Effect whammy bar and a Hall-Effect Strum Bar with haptic feedback. The Encore Edition only has traditional mechanical frets and a normal strum bar, but CRKD says both guitars are designed to be modular, so you can purchase and swap in new components down the road if you want. Both guitars have built-in analog sticks and a d-pad for navigating in-game menus, and offer three different methods of connecting the controller to your console, mobile device or PC: wired via a USB cable, wirelessly via a 2.4GHz wireless dongle or Bluetooth. The Xbox versions of the guitar controllers work across Xbox, PC and Android, while the multi-platform version works on PC, Switch, Android and PS3. Notably, if you're looking to play Guitar Hero instead of Rock Band , you'll want the multi-platform guitar controller, because it offers greater compatibility with Guitar Hero games. CRKD Guitar controllers fell to the wayside as the companies largely responsibly for making Guitar Hero and Rock Band games either moved on or where shutdown. The bright spots in the slow decline of the music rhythm game genre has been third-party PC games like Clone Hero and YARG , and Harmonix's Fortnite Festival , which brought Rock Band -style gameplay to Epic's battle royale game in 2023. The Gibson Les Paul Black Tribal Encore Edition Guitar Controller is available to pre-order now for $109.99 for the multi-platform version, or $119.99 for the Xbox version. The Gibson Les Paul Blueberry Burst Pro Edition Guitar Controller can be pre-ordered for $119.99 for the multi-platform version, or $129.99 for the Xbox version. Both guitar controllers will start shipping in June 2025.

    "description": "Video game preservation scored a win today with EA's decision to make four Command &amp; Conquer games open source. The company has released the source code for Command &amp; Conquer , Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert , Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade and Command &amp; Conquer: Generals through a GPL license. All four projects are available to the public on Github. In addition, EA is adding Steam Workshop support to more contemporary entries in the real-time strategy franchise, including a modding support pack with assets from the series titles on the SAGE engine, such as Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert 3 . This game genre has fallen out of vogue in recent years. But the C&amp;C series still has a lot of fans, so a fresh boost of modder interest could bring new players to the franchise. (Plus, never forget that Red Alert 3 also contains the single best line delivery in all of video game history.) EA released meticulous remasters of the first two installments of Command &amp; Conquer in 2020 , which included the release of those games' source code. In December, the company made several of its patents for accessibility open source as well. It's also encouraging to see EA taking a positive action around a beloved franchise, especially when its recent efforts to remaster The Sims and The Sims 2 was riddled with technical issues at launch that required heavy-duty patches to fix.

    "description": "Forza Horizon 5 is officially coming to the PS5 on April 29. We knew the racing sim was going multiplatform , and now we have a legit date when players will be able to race around a digital replica of Mexico.&nbsp; This version does have cross-play support , which has already been a boon for Xbox and PC players. Additionally, the PS5 build allows gamers to purchase all of the same car packs, including the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions. There’s a new and free content update for PS5, Xbox and PC players called Horizon Realms that features a set of in-game achievements based on the game’s dynamic and evolving world, which arrives on April 25. Horizon 5 comes to PS5 in three flavors. The base game costs $60; the Deluxe Edition, which comes with the game&#39;s car pass, costs $80; and the Premium Edition, which comes with all of the game&#39;s DLC, costs $100. If you pre-order the Premium Edition you also get early access to the game on April 25, though does it count as early access when the game&#39;s been out for over four years on Xbox and PC? That&#39;s for you and your wallet to decide. All editions are digital only — the &nbsp; Forza Horizon &nbsp; X account confirmed there are currently no plans for a physical release. Developer Playground Games has also run down the various graphics modes available on PlayStation 5. Regular PS5 consoles will have access to a 60 fps performance mode and a 30 fps quality mode. PS5 Pro owners will have the same options, but with &quot;increased fidelity&quot; in the performance mode and ray-traced car reflections in races and free roam. There is no word currently on resolution targets for either console, or how they shape up versus Xbox Series X/S. For the uninitiated, Forza Horizon 5 is a fantastic open-world racing game that we absolutely loved upon its initial release in 2021 . The graphics are top notch, with a gorgeous design aesthetic, and the open world is fun to just race around in. The game is so approachable that we said “you don&#39;t need to be into cars to love it.” This is just the latest former Xbox exclusive to bridge the console divide. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle debuted as an Xbox exclusive in December , but is also coming to the PS5 soon. Other former exclusives that have been allowed to roam free include Sea of Thieves , Hi-Fi Rush , Pentiment and Grounded .

    "title": "The best smartphones to buy in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",
    "description": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money. At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year. Android or iOS? When you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. As for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform. Cameras Since your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device. Cherlynn Low / Engadget Mid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes. Will you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7? The good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices. On the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router , so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone. Other features to consider Because not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches. Other smartphones we've tested Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Like its predecessor, the S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile phone. It’s one of the few handsets that come with an included stylus and premium features like a gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED display, titanium frame and a 5x telephoto camera. It also has excellent performance and strong battery life. The issue is that, aside from improved AI, this year’s phone doesn’t offer that much more than the previous model (or the one before that), and with prices starting at $1,300, we feel it needs to do more to earn a top pick spot. OnePlus 13 While the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors. OnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too. FAQs How do I know which smartphone is the best for me? While choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset. How much is a smartphone? Smartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000. What can you do on a smartphone? Smartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras. How long do smartphones last? Smartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis. Recent updates February 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e. January 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones. September 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-is-now-much-faster-on-chromebooks-210030799.html?src=rss",
    "description": "In a fitting crossover, Roblox is getting a big speed boost on Chromebooks . Google said on Thursday that a new x86 version of the online game platform and creation system is twice as fast as the Android version, which was previously the only way to play Roblox on ChromeOS. Given the overlap between Chromebooks ( popular in education ) and Roblox (popular with kids, for better or worse ), a better-performing version on ChromeOS seems like a good match. Although there are more ARM-based Chromebooks than before, most still use x86 architecture. Google says the new Roblox build provides smoother gameplay, quicker load times and \"an overall better Roblox experience.\" More specifically, you should see a 99 percent framerate increase in the virtual pet game Adopt Me! and a 67 percent boost in the role-playing sim Brookhaven RP . Load times are up to 29 percent faster when going from a fresh start to the login page. Alongside the x86 launch, Google and Roblox have some speed-themed in-game swag for Chromebook users. You can redeem a jetpack with a Chrome logo (of course!) for your avatar to fly around like a Google-sponsored Buzz Lightyear. You can also redeem a \"hoverboard\" (which looks suspiciously like a OneWheel ) for faster ground travel. You'll find both on Google's perks page . This isn't the first mashup between the two companies. Last year, they teamed up on a weird game that teaches kids about online safety , the, uh, \"interestingly\" named Be Internet Awesome World . Google told Engadget that you can install the x86 version of Roblox directly through the Play Store. Although that's typically where you find the Android version, the storefront should automatically deliver the right build for your laptop.

    "description": "At some point in 2025, Twitch plans to offer monetization tools like subscriptions and Bits for all streamers, according to an open letter from Twitch CEO Dan Clancy . Monetizing Twitch streams previously required reaching \"Affiliate\" status on the platform. Having viewers subscribe to a Twitch channel or cheer with Bits (Twitch's digital currency) during a stream are the two most prominent ways the average streamer can make money from their streams, outside of passive ad revenue or sponsorships. Currently, each subscription earns you a 50/50 split on subscription revenue after processing fees and taxes, while each Bit earned during a stream translates to around $0.01 . Opening up subscriptions and Bits to \"most streamers, from day one,\" should serve to make streaming on Twitch more enticing to anyone worried about the long process of becoming a Twitch Affiliate or Partner. Reaching either status on Twitch requires earning a certain amount of followers and streaming a certain amount of hours, on top of other criteria. With at least some monetization tools becoming available to everyone, climbing Twitch's ladder seems like it could become more about unlocking access to tools rather than the ability to earn money at all. (Thought novice streamers should keep in mind they must get a minimum of $50 to withdraw their earnings from Twitch at all.) Alongside these changes, Clancy also announced that Twitch will introduce more ways for streamers to earn money together, new editing tools for creating clips of streams and expanded moderation tools on mobile. Twitch's has been rethinking its approach to moderation and policy violations over the last few months. Earlier in February, the company tweaked how it enforces community guideline violations , making it so violations can \"expire\" after a certain amount of time.

    "description": "Amazon announced that it has created its own quantum computing chip, joining Microsoft and Google in a push to take this potentially transformative technology from the theoretical to the practical. Ocelot is a prototype that's intended to test the effectiveness of Amazon Web Services' quantum error correction architecture. Compared with other chip methods, the company claims Ocelot can reduce the cost of implementing quantum error correction by up to 90 percent. Quantum computing could solve complicated problems exponentially faster than standard computers by using quantum bits, or qubits, rather than traditional bits that store a computer's information as 1s and 0s. Rather than representing only a 1 or a 0, qubits can represent a proportion of both 1 and 0 at the same time. Ocelot takes this a step farther with its use of \"cat qubits,\" named for the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, which can \"intrinsically suppress certain forms of errors,\" according to Amazon. Error rate is one of the key limitations of current quantum computing, because the qubits are so sensitive to minute changes in their environments. Electromagnetic interference from a WiFi network can be enough to disturb a qubit and cause it to make mistakes. Adding more qubits to a chip means faster calculations, but also more mistakes. Ocelot consists of five data qubits (the cat qubits), five \"buffer circuits\" to stabilize them and four qubits for detecting errors on the cat qubits. \"We selected our qubit and architecture with quantum error correction as the top requirement,\" said Oskar Painter, director of quantum hardware at AWS. \"We believe that if we're going to make practical quantum computers, quantum error correction needs to come first.\" Google claimed that its Willow chip, announced in December, was able to reduce errors as more qubits were added. Ocelot is another step toward reducing errors and making useful quantum computers a reality.

    "title": "The 5 best mechanical keyboards for 2025",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mechanical-keyboard-120050723.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Your keyboard is one of the few pieces of technology you’ll use for hours at a time, so why not make it something that brings you joy? Sure, the people who gush over mechanical keyboards can be a bit much, but the enhanced comfort, durability and customizability that comes with the best 'boards is real. If you’re interested in making the switch (ahem), we’ve tested dozens of mechanical keyboards over the past year and rounded up our favorites below. We’ve also broken down what to look for as you shop. What to look for in a mechanical keyboard Layout The first thing to decide with any keyboard is what size and layout you want. Full-size layouts have all the keys you’d ever need — a number pad, a full function row, arrow keys, etc. — but they also have the largest physical footprint. A 96-percent or “1800” keyboard is similar, but crunches the navigation cluster (Page Up, Home, etc.), numpad and arrow keys closer together to save space. Tenkeyless (TKL) or 80-percent keyboards omit the number pad entirely; they're often considered the best blend of size and functionality. 75-percent keyboards keep almost all of the buttons of a TKL model but further reduce any “dead” space between them — think of them like the TKL versions of a 96 percent layout. It gets more and more minimal from there. The smallest popular layout is the 60 percent keyboard, which removes the arrow keys, function row, numpad and navigation cluster. This kind of design can be particularly useful for gaming, as it opens up a ton of desk space to swing your mouse around. It typically relies on shortcuts to make up for its missing keys, but it comes with a learning curve as a result. Even more compact options exist beyond that. These can be adorable, but they usually involve removing the number row, which is a step too far for most people. There are all sorts of ergonomic keyboards that utilize different shapes to improve your wrist and arm comfort as well, but we have a separate guide for those . Switch type No component has more of an impact on how a mechanical keyboard feels and sounds than the switches beneath its keycaps. The market for these tiny mechanisms is vast and complex but, to keep it simple, you can separate them into three types: linear, tactile and clicky. Which you prefer ultimately comes down to personal preference, so we encourage you to go to a store, try out a friend’s keyboard and test switches out to determine what you like best. Linear switches feel smooth and consistent all the way down. Many PC gamers prefer them because they’re often light and fast to actuate, so they can register inputs quickly. They tend to be quieter than other switch types as well, but some may find them too sensitive. Tactile switches create a noticeable “bump” partway through a press. They generally aren’t as fast as their linear counterparts, but many (including yours truly) enjoy the tangible sense of feedback they provide with each keystroke. This bit of resistance can make it a little easier to avoid typos, too. Many tactile switches are neither outright quiet nor disruptively loud. Clicky switches are, well, clicky. They work similarly to tactile switches but use an extra mechanism that makes a sharp click sound when pressed. The exact design of that mechanism can differ depending on the switch. Some people love the audible feedback of clicky switches. The people who work or live with them? Probably not so much. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Remember: These are general buckets. Within them lies an enormous variety of switches with differing actuation points, weights, springs, bump sensations and more. One linear, tactile, or clicky switch can feel and sound noticeably different than another. There are more dramatic variations as well. Low-profile switches, for one, can be linear, tactile or clicky but aren’t as tall and have a shorter travel distance. They allow for flatter and more compact designs, with keys that are fast to press but also easy to bottom out. Optical and Hall effect switches rely on different mechanisms entirely. Instead of a physical contact point, the former uses a beam of infrared light to register keystrokes, while the latter uses tiny magnets. Both commonly have a linear feel. They can also enable a few gaming-friendly features: You could set custom actuation points and make any key more or less sensitive, map multiple actions to one keystroke or even use an “analog mode” that emulates gamepad controls. (Newer inductive switches are said to offer similar benefits.) These are niche tricks, but they can make a difference for competitive-minded players. Boards that use these “analog” switches are frequently more expensive and less customizable than traditional mechanical options, though. Switch modifications It doesn’t stop at switch types: Manufacturers (and you!) can make several other tweaks to shape how a mechanical keyboard feels and sounds. Some have layers of different foam inside their case to tamp down noise, for instance. Some have switches that are lubricated out of the box to provide a smoother feel and more muted sound. A few others put plastic, rubber or foam “ films ” between the upper and bottom housing of a switch to keep it from wobbling and further tune its acoustics. Or they stick a layer of tape on their printed circuit board (PCB) to absorb higher-pitched sounds. We think most people will find that some well-applied foam and lubing makes things feel nicer, though this is another matter that comes down to taste. Keycaps Keycaps play a huge role in defining a keyboard’s character. First off, they should look nice! There’s a huge market for third-party keycaps in all different styles, from the playful to the professional to the proudly impractical . The majority of mechanical keyboards make it easy to swap in new keycaps, so it’s usually not a huge deal if you ever get bored with your device's stock set. Most keycaps are made from one of two types of plastic: ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) or PBT (polybutylene terephthalate). Keycaps using the latter tend to be higher-quality. They're often thicker, more durable, deeper-sounding and less prone to developing a shiny or greasy finish over time. Still, premium ABS keycaps do exist, so this is another case where what’s “best” partly comes down to personal taste. You may prefer an ABS keycap that feels smooth over a PBT model with a rougher texture. Keycap sets are available in several different shapes and sizes. Some are totally uniform; many others are distinctly sculpted to meet your fingers in (ostensibly) more natural positions. Which is most comfortable is something you’ll have to figure out for yourself. You can check out keycaps.info to see what the most popular keycap profiles look like. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Keyboard makers have several different methods of printing the letters and symbols (aka “legends”) that go on a set of keycaps. The two most common are known as double-shot and dye-sublimation . Double-shot caps are typically more durable but cost more to produce — they’re made by molding one color of plastic for the keycap around a second color of plastic for the legend. “Dye-sub” caps, in contrast, use heat to stain in the legends but are decently durable in their own right. For keyboards with RGB backlighting, it's best if the legends to be “shine-through,” so those color effects are visible through the keycaps. We don’t think it’s the end of the world if they aren’t — as you’ll see below — but the RGB won’t be as fun otherwise. Stabilizers Stabilizers (or “stabs”) are little components that go under large keys like the space bar or backspace to keep them from rattling or wobbling when pressed. These come in different types as well. Many a decent keyboard has been hindered by subpar stabilizers, so it’s worth checking your bigger keys first to ensure they aren’t distractingly shaky or uneven. Mounting styles and case quality A keyboard’s mounting style determines how its PCB and plate — i.e., a common (but not universal) layer that holds the keycaps in place above the PCB — are secured within its case. This, too, comes in varying styles and can have a significant effect on how the board feels and sounds. It’s also something that’s best explained visually, so we’ll point you to this excellent infographic from Thomas Baart instead of running through every possible configuration here. It’s hard to say one mounting style is always better than the others, but many enthusiast boards these days use some sort of gasket mount, which puts a gasket material on either side to separate the plate from the main case. Done well, this can make typing feel softer and bouncier than it would on a more traditional, tray-mounted design. Regardless of what’s going on under the hood, a good keyboard shouldn’t feel cheap on the outside, either. Its case shouldn’t flex under pressure or feel hollow as you’re clacking away. Higher-end models often have cases made from metal or sturdier plastic — the former may feel more premium but it’s typically heavier and pricier. Customizations and software We focused on pre-built models here, but that doesn’t mean customization isn’t important. Experimenting with different switches and keycaps is half the fun of this hobby, after all. For this guide, we prioritized keyboards that are “hot-swappable,” which means they let you easily remove and replace switches without having to desolder anything. Permanently attached switches may be more stable, but fixing a broken hot-swappable switch should be relatively painless — and more affordable to boot. We also valued keyboards that are easy to program and customize through software, whether it’s a manufacturer-specific app or popular open-source programs like VIA . Not everyone will go through the trouble to set macros, customize backlighting or remap keys, but it’s better to have the option if your mindset changes down the road. It’s a plus if a keyboard works across multiple operating systems, particularly Windows and macOS, just in case you ever switch allegiances. If the device comes with OS-specific keycaps you can pop on to make the experience less clunky, that’s even better. Connectivity Wireless connectivity isn’t essential with a device that mostly sits on your desk, but it’s always nice to cut down on cables. Though wireless keyboards still cost more than wired ones, today you can get something great for less than $100. If you do go wireless, look for a model that can connect over Bluetooth and a USB wireless dongle. The former is convenient for travel, while the latter can provide a more stable connection. For wired keyboards, you want a detachable USB cable so you don’t have to replace your entire device if the cord ever frays or breaks. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Backlight Good backlighting will make any keyboard easier to use in the dark. We gave bonus points to keyboards with fully programmable RGB lights, as they can be particularly fun to mess with, but they're not essential. As noted above, the strength of your backlight will be neutered if your keycaps’ legends aren’t transparent. Rotary knob Some mechanical keyboards come configured with a rotary knob, which typically controls volume by default but can be customized to control other inputs as well. This is more of a fun bonus than anything else, but we found it hard to give up on devices without one. How we tested To be clear, there isn’t one “best” mechanical keyboard for everyone. Yes, some are likely to be better for most people than others; that’s what we set out to find with this guide. But ultimately, this is one of those categories that’ll largely depend on your personal tastes. It’s also worth reiterating that we only considered pre-built models for this guide. We still valued keyboards that are configurable with different switches, keycaps and other design tweaks upfront and easy to customize after purchase. However, we recognize that many people just want to pay for a nice thing and enjoy it, without having to do homework on how they can make it better. If you want to get hardcore later on and start building your own custom keyboards, we have a whole separate guide for that. With that said, we started our research by reading a ton of reviews from both professionals and everyday users, trawling enthusiast forums along the way. This helped us whittle down the devices that had a shot of being a top pick and were readily available from reputable brands. From there, we used each keyboard as our daily driver for a few days, typing up thousands of words, playing PC games and paying attention to the key aspects noted above. We fully charged each wireless model and monitored its battery drain to ensure it lined up with their advertised rating. We also ensured any companion software worked as intended. It’s worth keeping in mind that new mechanical keyboards are coming out all the time. It's very difficult to get to everything, but we'll continue to monitor the market and update this guide as noteworthy boards arrive. Other mechanical keyboards we tested Just a few of the other mechanical keyboards we tested for this guide. Clockwise from top left: the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless (2023), the G.Skill KM250 RGB, the Lofree Block, the NZXT Function 2 and the Lofree Flow. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Lofree Block The wireless Lofree Block feels great and has a fun retro aesthetic that looks like it belongs next to an old Mac. Its keys are wonderfully smooth to the touch and create a nice thocky tone. At $169, it’s a good middle ground between the Keychron Q Max and V Max series if you dig the look. However, it doesn’t have any software for programming macros, it only has a white backlight and it only comes in a full-size layout. Are those huge issues? No. But there are fine margins separating these things once you get to a certain point. Lofree Flow It’s a similar story with the Lofree Flow , a low-profile model. Its full-POM switches are softer and noticeably quieter than the NuPhy Air V2, and its thin aluminum case looks and feels high-quality. It can only work wirelessly using Bluetooth, though, and we noticed a couple of connection hiccups in testing. There’s still no software, either, plus its backlight is fairly weak. It also costs $40 or so more than the Air75 V2. Still, it’s a great alternative. Keychron K Max The low-profile Keychron K Max series has all the requisite features and costs less than the NuPhy Air75 V2 and Lofree Flow. If you don’t like the Air V2’s style and want a cheaper low-profile model, it’s worth a look. That said, the keycaps on NuPhy’s board feel a bit higher-quality, and the tactile Gateron switches in our K Max unit sound thinner. NZXT Function 2 &amp; Function 2 MiniTKL The full-size NZXT Function 2 and tenkeyless NZXT Function 2 MiniTKL are perfectly solid gaming keyboards with fast optical switches, durable PBT keycaps, tasteful RGB lighting, sound-dampening foam and aluminum top plates. They support a fair amount of customization through NZXT’s CAM app , including the ability to swap between two different universal actuation settings. The stabilizers on larger keys exhibit some rattle, though, and the Wooting 80HE's magnetic switches are far more versatile for not too much extra cash. The Razer Huntsman V2 TKL. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget MelGeek Modern97 With its fun speckled color scheme, gasket-mounted design and multiple foam layers, the MelGeek Modern97 is a solid value at $139. The linear, pre-lubed Kailh Box Plastic switches in our unit are smooth and enjoyably clacky, while the larger keys are neither hollow nor overly loud. All of the switches are hot-swappable, and the whole thing works over USB-C, Bluetooth or a 2.4GHz dongle. Alas, its ABS keycaps start to feel slicker and greasier with extended use. This model also has a 90 percent layout, which saves a little extra desk space compared to a 96 percent board but can lead to more accidental presses around the arrow keys. Razer Huntsman V2 TKL The Razer Huntsman V2 TKL is a quality gaming keyboard with light optical switches, crisp shine-through keycaps, a sturdy frame and an impressively muffled sound thanks to some internal foam. (If you buy the model with Razer’s linear optical switches, that is; another variant with clicky switches isn’t nearly as quiet.) It’s often available in the $100 range, and at that price it’s a solid pick. It’s neither wireless nor hot-swappable, though, and its keys wobble more than those on the Keychron V Max. Razer Huntsman V3 Pro The analog Razer Huntsman V3 Pro is a decent alternative to the Wooting 80HE if the latter’s shipping delays become too great. It’s available in a 60 percent, TKL or full-size layout, and it offers a similar set of gaming features, including an adjustable actuation range and a rapid trigger setting for repeating keystrokes faster. But its optical switches are noisier and more hollow-feeling than Wooting’s Hall effect setup, so it’s not as pleasant for typing. The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless (Gen 3). Jeff Dunn for Engadget SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless (Gen 3) We recommend the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless in our guide to the best gaming keyboards , and it remains a good choice if you want the extensive customizability of the Wooting 80HE in a wireless design. It also comes with a wrist rest, unlike Wooting’s keyboard, and it offers an impressive typing experience in its own right. SteelSeries’ configuration software is clunkier to navigate than Wootility, though, and at $270 it’s pricier than Keychron Q Max without having quite as premium a design. G.Skill KM250 The $45 G.Skill KM250 is the top budget pick in our gaming keyboard guide, and it’s still a better buy than the Keychron C3 Pro is gaming is your chief concern. Compared to Keychron’s board, it adds hot-swappable switches, full RGB backlighting, PBT keycaps and a rotary knob in a smaller 65 percent layout. That said, the C3 Pro’s fuller sound and springier keystrokes make it superior for typing, and its tenkeyless design should be more comfortable for a wider swath of people. It’s typically available for $10 to $15 less, too. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Logitech G Pro X TKL &amp; G Pro X 60 The Logitech G Pro X TKL and 60 percent Logitech G Pro X 60 are well-built but far too expensive for gaming keyboards that lack hot-swappable switches and the analog functionality of competitors like the Wooting 80HE. Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid The Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid is better, and a fine magnetic-switch alternative to the Wooting 80HE if you must buy from one of the major keyboard brands. It’s wired-only, but it looks good, with clear RGB lighting, a built-in volume roller, dedicated media keys and a sturdy metal top plate. Its rapid trigger and adjustable actuation features all work fine, and Logitech’s G Hub software is easier to get around than most apps from the big-name manufacturers. All of it costs $30 less than the 80HE as well. Where it falls short is the typing experience: The default switches are pretty noisy, and bottoming out the keys feels stiffer.&nbsp; The ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless The ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is a wireless 96 percent keyboard that’s marketed toward gamers but should feel great to anyone. The pre-lubed, linear ROG NX Snow switches in our test unit are smooth and quiet, while the PBT keycaps feel stable and high-quality. The keycaps let the RGB backlight shine through cleanly, plus there’s a clever multi-function key that puts various lighting and media controls in one place. ASUS’ Armoury Crate software is sloppy, though, and the board’s overall look may be too gamer-y for some. At $180, it’s not cheap either. The Keychron Q5 Max costs $40 more but gets you a more premium (if heavier) all-aluminum chassis; here, the housing is plastic. ASUS ROG Azoth The ASUS ROG Azoth is like a 75 percent version of the Strix Scope II 96 Wireless with a few more enthusiast touches. Its gasket-mounted design gives keystrokes a slightly softer landing, it has a programmable OLED display and it even includes a switch lubing kit in the box. Like the Strix, its hardware is very clearly high-grade. But its software is much more aggravating and, with a list price of $250, it's a worse value than the Keychron Q Max. Corsair K70 RGB TKL The Corsair K70 RGB TKL isn’t bad in a vacuum, but it lacks wireless functionality and fully hot-swappable switches. It’s on the noisy side, too, and Corsair’s iCue software is rough. The Logitech G Pro X 60. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Corsair K70 Max The full-size Corsair K70 Max is another high-end gaming keyboard with magnetic Hall effect sensors and Wooting-style features, but trying to program those settings through Corsair’s iCue app gave us headaches. The 80HE also feels better for typing, with less rattling on large keys like the space bar. Wooting’s HE keyboards support a slightly wider actuation range on top of that, plus they cost $30 to $55 less depending on size. Razer Huntsman Mini The Razer Huntsman Mini is a fine value if you want a no-frills 60 percent keyboard for less than $100, but it’s another wired-only model that isn’t truly hot-swappable. Logitech G915 TKL The Logitech G915 TKL is a wireless low-profile model with a metal frame and handy media controls. The GL Tactile switches in our test unit are comfortable and not particularly noisy. But the thin ABS keycaps feel way too cheap for something that costs $180, the keys themselves are a little too wobbly and the switches aren't hot-swappable. The NuPhy Air75 V2 is a superior value. Logitech released an upgraded model with PBT keycaps and a USB-C port last year; we'll aim to test that one for our next update, but it’s still pretty expensive at $200. Recent notes February 2025 : We’ve updated this guide with a new gaming pick, the Wooting 80HE, and ensured the rest of our recommendations are still accurate. We've also added a few notes on other keyboards we've recently tested. We’ve put several other gaming-oriented models through their paces since our last update: You can find testing notes for those in our dedicated gaming keyboard buying guide .

    "title": "OpenAI's new GPT-4.5 model is a better, more natural conversationalist",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-gpt-45-model-is-a-better-more-natural-conversationalist-200035185.html?src=rss",
    "description": "In what has already been a busy past few days for new model releases , OpenAI is capping off the week with a research preview of GPT-4.5 . The company is touting the new system as its largest and best model for chat yet. In early testing, OpenAI says people found GPT-4.5 to be a more natural conversationalist, with the ability to convey warmth and display a kind of emotional intelligence. In one example shared by OpenAI, a person tells ChatGPT they&#39;re going through a hard time after failing a test. Where the company&#39;s previous models, including GPT-4o and o3-mini , might commiserate with the individual before offering a long list of unsolicited advice, GPT-4.5 takes a different tact. &quot;Want to talk about what happened, or do you just need a distraction? I&#39;m here either way,&quot; the chatbot says when powered by GPT-4.5. The gains shown by GPT-4.5 are the result of advancements OpenAI made in unsupervised learning. With unsupervised learning, a machine learning algorithm is given an unlabeled data set and left to its own devices to find patterns and insights. GPT-4.5 doesn&#39;t &quot;think&quot; like the company&#39;s state-of-the-art reasoning models, but in training the new model OpenAI made architectural enhancements and gave it access to more data and compute power. &quot;The result is a model that has broader knowledge and a deeper understanding of the world, leading to reduced hallucinations,&quot; the company says. Speaking of reduced hallucinations, OpenAI measured how much better GPT-4.5 in that regard. When put through SimpleQA , an OpenAI-designed benchmark that tests large language models on their ability to answer &quot;straightforward but challenging knowledge questions,&quot; GPT-4.5 beat out o3-mini, GPT-4o and even o1 with a hallucination rate of 37.1 percent. Obviously, the new model doesn&#39;t solve the problem of AI hallucinations altogether, but it is a step in the right direction. Despite its relative strengths over GPT-4o and o3-mini, GPT-4.5 isn&#39;t a direct replacement for those models. Compared to OpenAI&#39;s reasoning systems, GPT-4.5 is &quot;a more general-purpose, innately smarter model.&quot; Additionally, it&#39;s not natively multimodal like GPT-4o, meaning it doesn&#39;t work with features like Voice Mode , video or screensharing. It’s also &quot;a very large and compute-intensive model.&quot; It&#39;s best to think of GPT-4.5 as a stepping stone to systems OpenAI plans to offer in the future. In fact, Sam Altman said as much earlier this month when he shared the company&#39;s roadmap , noting GPT-4.5 would be &quot;our last non-chain-of-thought model&quot; — referring to the fact that the new system doesn&#39;t solve problems by tackling them step by step like OpenAI&#39;s reasoning models do. Its successor, GPT-5, will likely integrate many of OpenAI&#39;s latest technologies, including its frontier o3 model . OpenAI reiterated that today, saying it plans to bring GPT-4.5&#39;s &quot;unique strengths, including broader knowledge, stronger intuition, and greater &#39;EQ,&#39; to all users in future models.&quot; In the meantime, ChatGPT Pro subscribers can begin using GPT-4.5 starting today, with Pro and Team users slated to gain access starting next week.

    "title": "Pokémon Champions is all about the battles",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-champions-is-all-about-the-battles-194527252.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Game Freak dropped a surprise trailer at today’s Pokémon Presents livestream for something called Pokémon Champions . It’s a dedicated battle sim, recalling the glory days of Pokémon Stadium for the N64. This means that Champions distills the franchise&#39;s formula down to just battling, with a heavy emphasis on multiplayer. To that end, the game is cross-platform, with the developer saying that players on “Nintendo Switch and mobile” will be able to duke it out. We don’t know what kind of roster the game itself will provide, but it integrates with the cloud-storage service Pokémon Home . People should be able to pull most of their favorite Pokémon from titles like Pokémon Go and recent mainline entries like Pokémon Sword and Shield . It also works with the spin-off Pokémon Legends: Arceus . The official press release, however, does note that there will be some restrictions when it comes to availability . The gameplay should feel instantly familiar to anyone who has ever dabbled in the franchise, as the trailer description touts tried-and-true “mechanics such as Pokémon types, abilities and moves.” The footage even shows more niche mechanics like Mega Evolution and Terastallization, indicating that players may not be tied to the base-level Pokémon rule set. There’s no release window yet. All we know is that it’s currently in development. Speaking of release dates, today’s livestream did reveal that Pokémon Legends: Z-A will be coming out by the end of the year for the Switch.

    "description": "Adult Swim announced that it would air the next anime from Shinichirō Watanabe, the creator of Cowboy Bebop , way back in 2023, and as of today, we finally have a release date. Lazarus is set to premiere on April 5 at midnight on Adult Swim, and will be available to stream on Max the day after. Lazarus follows a task force of agents, also called Lazarus, who are hunting a mad scientist that developed a miracle drug called \"Hapna.\" The drug was created to be a painkiller, but was also secretly designed to kill whoever takes it, three years after it's first taken. Lazarus are trying to find the creator of Hapna to create a vaccine that prevents the drug's negative side effects, and save the world in the process. Based on the trailer, the series' sci-fi setting, jazzy music (provided by Bonobo, Floating Points and Kamasi Washington) and shaggy-haired protagonist Axel all recall Watanabe's previous series Cowboy Bebop , but Lazarus looks like it'll have its own charms, too. The series' action sequences are choreographed by by John Wick director Chad Stahelski and the story takes inspiration from the opioid crisis and climate change, according to a Polygon interview with Watanabe from October 2024. Watanabe's last series Carole &amp; Tuesday premiered on Netflix in the US in 2019 and Netflix's less-than-stellar live action remake of Cowboy Bebop came and went in 2021. The world is more than ready for some original strength Shinichirō Watanabe anime, and now it won't have to wait much longer to get it.

    "description": "As TikTok&#39;s fate in the US sits in limbo , the ByteDance-owned company figured now&#39;s as good a time as any to spruce up the platform&#39;s (previously lackluster) desktop experience. New features include a repositioned navigation bar, an Explore tab, a floating player for Chrome and — in a move that should catch Twitch&#39;s attention — live game streaming in landscape orientation. Before Thursday&#39;s changes, TikTok&#39;s web app layout included a search bar and shortcuts running across the top of the screen alongside links down the left side. Now, all of them have been consolidated into the vertical navigation bar to the left. The idea is to reduce distractions for more immersive viewing as the platform moves to compete with the likes of YouTube and Twitch. Speaking of Twitch, TikTok now supports full-screen live game streaming in portrait and landscape modes. Before today, you could only do the latter using TikTok&#39;s Live Studio app . When you stream live in landscape, desktop users will see that view by default, while mobile users can rotate their devices to watch in widescreen (like everyone did before TikTok came along). Meanwhile, a floating player that keeps TikTok visible above your other windows is exclusive to Chrome for desktop. There&#39;s also a new Collections feature (similar to YouTube&#39;s playlists), where you can organize your favorite videos in custom categories, making it easier to return to them later. Mobile app features moving to the desktop include the For You feed , where you&#39;ll find algorithmically chosen content based on your interests, and the Explore page, which shows trending hashtags and popular content. The changes to the desktop browser version are now available globally.

    "description": "Game Freak held a Pokémon Presents livestream today and we finally got a good look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A . The new trailer for the follow-up to the well-received Pokémon Legends: Arceus reveals the massive Lumiose City, which first appeared in Pokémon X and Y all the way back in 2013. It’s a bustling metropolis filled with skyscrapers, and a far cry from the serene countryside of Arceus . The trailer spotlighted the three starter Pokémon players will be able to choose from. They include the gen 2 starters Chikorita and Totodile and the gen 5 starter Tepig. We also got a better look at the gameplay elements, and they seem like something of a hybrid between the real-time capture mechanics of Arceus and the old-school turn-based gameplay of traditional Pokémon titles. Pokémon Legends: Z-A will also bring back Mega Evolutions, which turn regular pocket monsters into superpowered monstrosities with temporary stat boosts. This mechanic, just like Z-A’s location, was first introduced in Pokémon X and Y . We have a bit longer to wait for this one. The game doesn’t come out until the end of the year. It’s also being released for the original Switch, despite the fact that the Switch 2 will most likely be on store shelves by that point. However, long-time readers may remember that the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, so it’ll run on both machines. Game Freak also showed off a new game called Pokémon Champions , which is a cross-platform battle sim. Today’s Pokémon Presents livestream celebrated the 29th birthday of the franchise. Happy birthday, cute pets we force to live inside of tiny balls and fight to the death!

    "description": "If you’re thinking about getting a live TV streaming service, you’re probably looking for some combination of live news, local stations, linear channels and live sports — without having to sign a cable contract. The good news is that, even though YouTube TV , Hulu + Live TV , Sling , Philo , DirecTV Steam , and Fubo have all raised monthly subscription prices over the past year, these offerings are still usually cheaper than many cable packages. Plus, if you have an internet connection and a smart TV, you don’t need any additional equipment to stream. There are a few major players out there and we tested them all. We also point out other options to check out, now that the streaming landscape overall has shifted. For example, some standard streaming services offer linear channels and live programming , and free ad-supported streaming (FAST) services like Plex and Pluto stream linear programming that echoes broadcast TV. Prime Video subscriptions will now include NBA and WNBA games and Peacock aired the Olympics last summer. Even the Super Bowl was available for free through Tubi , thanks to its parent company, Fox. Still, a live TV streaming service is your best bet for the most comprehensive access to news, sports, linear and local channels. Here, we break down which service offers which, comparing pricing, plans, channels and ease of navigation to help you pick the best live TV streaming service for you. Editor’s Note (2/27/25) : A contract dispute between Paramount and YouTube TV had the potential to remove all of Paramount’s content from the streaming service on February 13. Both parties came to an agreement a few days later and the channels will remain on Google’s live streaming service. In another reversal, HBO recently scrapped plans to start charging $10 extra per month for the live B/R Sports content available with Max subscriptions. The content, which includes MLB, NHL, NBA, NCAA Men's March Madness, U.S. Soccer and other games, will continue to be available to Standard and Premium subscribers. Starting March 30, those paying for the Basic with Ads tier will lose access. Additionally, DirectTV Stream recently announced three additional Genre Packs to accompany the $70-per-month MySports bundle . The MyEntertainment bundle has 40 channels like Bravo and A&amp;E, along with Hulu and Disney+ Basic for $35 per month. There’s also a news pack and a Spanish language bundle for $40 and $35 respectively. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games . Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels . The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus , which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. But for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree , though we haven’t had a chance to test that one yet. Here's the best of what we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app . Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna , you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV &amp; streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations , and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max ( formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on . You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games . Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi . While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper too. While the promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year, shortly after, DirecTV announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&amp;E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on , after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV ( FAST ) including Freevee , Tubi , PlutoTV and Sling Freestream . These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel , the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV . Back to top How we tested When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town . I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen . Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million . How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials. Back to top Recent updates January 31, 2025 : Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi’s free option. Updated Fubo’s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream’s sports-only package and Comcast’s sports and news bundle. January 16, 2025 : Included higher prices for Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV’s new sports package. December 31, 2024 : Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon’s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV’s free service. August 6, 2024 : Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu.&nbsp; June 12, 2024 : Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.

    "description": "DirecTV just announced the availability of Genre Packs , which are channel groupings tied to specific interests. The satellite TV provider teased this in January with the introduction of a sports-related bundle , but now there are more to choose from . These new packs include options for news, entertainment and Spanish language content. Just like the MySports subscription, many of these new bundles come with live TV channels and subscriptions to streaming platforms. For instance, the MyEntertainment bundle allows access to around 40 channels, including Bravo and FX, but also includes a subscription to Disney+ with Hulu. That one costs $35 per month, making for a pretty good deal. DirecTV The MyNews bundle doesn’t come with any premium streaming subscriptions, but does allow access to the 24-hour news cycle in all of its brain-melting glory. Purchasers get access to all of the big ones here, including MSNBC, Fox News, CNN and, for some reason, Newsmax. It costs $40 per month, which seems like a lot just to watch a bunch of rich people yell at you, but what do I know. MiEspañol offers access to more than 50 channels, including many Spanish-language stalwarts like Univision and Telemundo. It costs $35 per month. The MySports bundle, introduced in January, is still around, for $70 per month. It provides access to more than 25 sports-related channels and includes a subscription to ESPN+.

    "description": "On March 3, Mobile World Congress will kick off in Barcelona, Spain. While it’s not the premier show it once was, many noteworthy smartphone makers around the world still attend the conference and frequently launch new devices there. Typically, we hear from companies like Lenovo, Arm, Xiaomi, Dell and more at the conference, as well as standards organizations like the GSMA on developments in areas like 5G or SIM technology. Occasionally, bigger players like Samsung and LG join the fray, too, and who can forget the year the Nokia 3310 brought nostalgic joy to MWC .&nbsp; Judging by the event agenda on the MWC website , we will be seeing at least some kind of presence from Meta about WhatsApp , though it's unlikely the company announces anything major at that event. Below, you’ll find a list of the more notable devices we expect to be launched at MWC 2025. Nothing Phone 3a series At MWC 2022, Nothing’s Carl Pei showed off a prototype of what would become the company’s first handset, the Nothing Phone 1 , behind closed doors, and at last year’s event, Nothing announced the Phone 2(a) . This year, we’re definitely getting at least one new device from the company at MWC, with Nothing teasing the reveal of the 3a series for March 4, the second day of the show.&nbsp; Since Engadget first published this article, Nothing has gone on to reveal the design of one of the phones it plans to announce next week, the 3a Pro. On Monday, the company posted a nearly 11-minute long video showcasing the design of the upcoming device. Notably, the phone features a prominent camera bump to accommodate a periscope telephoto lens. That's not something we see on many phones in the 3a price range, so it will be interesting to see how it performs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Phone (3a) Series. Power in perspective. 4 March 10 AM GMT. pic.twitter.com/auesJycJQy — Nothing (@nothing) January 30, 2025 Xiaomi 15 Ultra Xiaomi In 2024, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra made its global debut ahead of MWC , and it’s looking like history will repeat. Before the start of this month, there was some evidence to suggest Xiaomi would launch its new flagship at MWC 2025, but more recent rumors suggest the company plans to announce the 15 Ultra on February 26. In any case, Xiaomi is listed as an exhibitor at MWC 2025, so if the phone does debut before the end of this month, there’s a good chance it will be on the show floor for people to try out. Like the 14 Ultra before it, it looks like the 15 Ultra will be a photography powerhouse, with the phone rumored to feature a 1-inch main sensor and 200-megapixel periscope telephoto lens. HMD Global Since 2017, HMD Global has been a mainstay at MWC. First, with its Nokia-branded phones, including retro throwbacks like the 8110 Reloaded , and now more recently with devices carrying its own name . Given that history, it seems a safe bet the company will have something to announce at the show. What that could be is more of a mystery, though it’s possible the sub-$100 HMD Key could get a global release. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Samsung After Samsung teased the Galaxy S25 Edge at Unpacked last month , you might think it would be fitting for the company to launch the phone in Barcelona next month. After all, MWC was the venue where, up until the Galaxy S10 in 2019 , Samsung announced every S series phone beginning with the S2 back in 2011, and the company’s presence at MWC was the highlight of the event. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem Samsung is feeling nostalgic for and the sunny boulevards of Barcelona, with little in the way of rumors suggesting we could see the S25 Edge at MWC 2025. Still, never discount the chance Samsung may have a surprise up its sleeve. Redmagic Chinese manufacturer Redmagic is not only attending MWC 2025 but the company has already provided a preview of what it plans to show off at the event. Expect two new versions of its 10 Pro phone, including a limited edition \" Golden Saga \" variant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything else As Engadget’s resident AI reporter, I’m obligated to mention a lot of companies will probably have AI-related announcements to share at MWC 2025. Don’t expect anything from the big players like OpenAI — the company isn’t registered as an exhibitor — but with artificial intelligence being the trendy thing in the industry right now, everyone will be trying to cash in on the hype; in fact, “ AI+ ” is one of the main themes of MWC 2025. There may also be other technologies that get shown off at MWC 2025. For example, Nokia announced on February 25 that it's teaming up with Vodafone and RingCentral to \"showcase [the] future of voice calls\" at the event. It's called \"immersive voice and audio services (IVAS)\" and the company is saying it's \"the most significant advancement in voice-call audio technology in decades.\" The press release said that IVAS would \"allows people to hear sound spatially in real-time, making conversations and interaction natural, and lifelike.\" We'll have to wait till the demos to know for sure what that means. Update, February 21 2025, 1:45PM ET: This story has been updated to add more context in the intro, calling out a few more companies that typically present at MWC, as well as some additional info pulled from the MWC agenda page. Update, February 25 2025, 12:45PM ET : This story has been updated to add more context about Nothing's MWC plans and to add mention of Redmagic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Update, February 27 2025, 11:05AM ET : This story has been updated to add more context in the intro about companies that have appeared at MWC in years past, as well as mention Nokia's announcement of IVAS.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-cuts-the-price-of-ps-vr2-to-400-154138227.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Sony is permanently reducing the price of the PlayStation VR2 . Starting in March, the headset will cost $400, €450 and £400 — down from $550, €600 and £530, respectively. Included in the price cut is the Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle, which, like the standard package, will cost $400, €450 or £400 depending on your region. While it’s been possible to buy the PS VR2 for less than $400 during recent sales , the new pricing should give retailers the flexibility to discount the device even more aggressively down the road. It’s hard to say what this means for the future of the PS VR2. Arguably, it was too expensive at launch, and at $400, it still costs more than the Meta Quest 3S , a standalone headset that doesn’t require a PlayStation 5 or PC to power it. Sony recently added support for low-latency hand tracking , but overall the company doesn’t appear keen on investing more time and money into the platform. Major first-party studios haven’t made many games for the PS VR2, and those that have, including the creators of Call of the Mountain, have seen layoffs in recent months .

    "title": "Hulu prematurely ended its Oscars stream right before the final awards",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/622669/hulu-oscars-stream-ended-early",
    "description": "Hulu subscribers watching the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday night were outraged when the streaming service ended its broadcast before the show was actually over. Viewers saw a “thank you for watching” message that falsely claimed “the live event has now ended” — despite the fact that the Best Actress and Best Picture Oscars were still to come. Social media platforms and the Hulu subreddit immediately lit up with complaints and threats of cancellation. It turned out to be a rough night for the Disney-owned service. A few hours earlier, Hulu acknowledged that some customers were having issues logging in : that problem was rectified slightly before 9PM ET . But shutting off the live stream ahead of the evening’s biggest prizes was an even more embarrassing blunder. The error came down to scheduling: Hulu gave the Oscars a set ending time of 10:32PM. That’s exactly when viewers started getting kicked out of the stream. But as usual, several acceptance speeches ran long on Sunday night, and Hulu’s chosen cutoff time didn’t allow enough wiggle room for an often-unpredictable broadcast. “This evening, we experienced technical and live stream issues on Hulu which impacted some Oscars viewers,” Disney said in a statement provided by spokesperson Dorothy Ballowe. “We apologize for the experience and will make a full replay of the event available as soon as possible.” I don’t know how we’re still having these streaming mishaps in 2025 — especially from the company that owns the rights to the Oscars telecast, the network it was carried on, and the streaming service in question — but here we are. Cable viewers and those watching with a TV antenna were spared from the technical difficulties. Customers streaming through Hulu with Live TV were also unaffected since they were seeing the live, linear ABC feed. The situation is reminiscent of Super Bowl LII in 2018, when Hulu similarly ended its live broadcast in some markets before the game had concluded. Update, March 3rd 12:20AM: The article has been updated with comment from Disney.",

We&#8217;re fresh off CES , where we saw plenty of new gadgets, from TVs to gaming handhelds and smart glasses . But, as it says right in the name, MWC 2025 is more focused on&#8230; mobile stuff. And it&#8217;s for a global audience, which means not everything will make its way to the US. Expect announcements from companies like Xiaomi and Nothing, the latter of which will unveil the Nothing Phone 3A , and other global phone makers. Larger firms like Samsung and Google will be there, though it&#8217;s still unclear if they&#8217;ll have news. But we&#8217;re still waiting for more details on Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S25 Edge , so maybe that&#8217;ll pop up at the show. We&#8217;ll also look for more obscure and fun stuff that&#8217;s only available here on the floor.

    "title": "Infinix’s new concepts use solar power to charge your phone",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/622581/infinix-solar-phone-case-concept-mwc",
    "description": "Honestly I’m into this back panel design even without the solar functionality. Chinese phone brand Infinix is known to show off a flashy concept , and at this year’s MWC the company is looking skyward for inspiration. It’s showing a phone with an integrated solar panel on the back, as well as a solar charging phone case. They’re both in the concept phase, but the demo units I saw at MWC were functional and the idea is plenty appealing. Infinix calls this SolarEnergy-Reserving technology, and it uses perovskite solar cells like Anker’s beach umbrella and cloak concept . These cells are thinner and cheaper to produce than traditional silicon solar cells. That’s paired with a system that helps regulate voltage called Maximum Power Point Tracking. The idea is to maximize power while managing heat; sitting under a hot sun might be good for solar cells, but it’s generally not great if you want to keep your phone from overheating. As it exists now, this technology can charge a phone at up to 2W, and is intended to pad out a phone’s reserved charge while it’s not in use. The phone with built-in solar panel on the back is pretty self-explanatory, but I think the case is more interesting. It’s paired with a prototype phone that has a couple of small contacts on the side to deliver power from the case. Being able to swap it out for a regular case when you’re, say, going out at night would make sense. Likewise, having it around during a power outage would be handy. Infinix is having a little fun at MWC, too, and is also showing off its second-gen color-changing E Ink phone. On the previous version, the back panel only changed color when plugged in. Now, it will run on the phone’s internal battery power, and is more customizable with a range of patterns and palettes. They all look pretty similar, but in theory you can choose a photo as inspiration for the color palette or set it to change with the weather. Because it’s 2025, it does this with the help of — you guessed it — artificial intelligence.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784480/threads-instagram-meta-news-twitter-competitor",
    "description": "As Twitter continues to flail about under Elon Musk, all eyes are on the newly launched Instagram Threads as a potential replacement.

Two days in, Mark Zuckerberg said Threads has registered over 70 million accounts , and it&rsquo;s still growing. In an interview about Threads with The Verge , Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri explains why the platform wants to take on Twitter. &ldquo;Obviously, Twitter pioneered the space,&rdquo; Mosseri says. &ldquo;And there are a lot of good offerings out there for public conversations. But just given everything that was going on, we thought there was an opportunity to build something that was open and something that was good for the community that was already using Instagram.&rdquo; View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Verge (@verge) Rumors about the new Meta-owned platform were swirling for months, with a March report from Platformer revealing the company was &ldquo;exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates.&rdquo; In June, Alex Heath leaked the details of a companywide meeting where the app was shown off and shared the first glimpse at Threads . Threads is &ldquo;Instagram&rsquo;s text-based conversation app&rdquo; where &ldquo;communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what&rsquo;ll be trending tomorrow.&rdquo; The app is closely tied to Instagram, meaning you&rsquo;ll get to use the same username across both apps as well as quickly follow all of the accounts you&rsquo;ve been following on Instagram.

Having already run the country once before, Trump entered the presidency with the goal of hitting the ground running, having already selected nominees and chairs for key agencies that oversee tech.

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/621693/lenovo-laptop-concept-yoga-solar-power-mwc",
    "description": "The Lenovo Yoga Solar PC concept will let you work while touching grass. | Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto Lenovo has announced a new concept laptop at Mobile World Congress that encourages you to work outside by reducing your dependence on power cables. The Yoga Solar PC is an early proof of concept device featuring a solar panel integrated into the laptop’s lid. It can harness light from any source to boost its battery, but as with most solar-powered devices, you’ll get the most power while working outside on a clear, sunny day. The company hasn’t announced any plans to put the Yoga Solar PC into production. However, its ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, featuring an expanding and rollable OLED display, initially debuted as a concept at Mobile World Congress in 2023 but will be available sometime in June 2025 for $3,499. The Yoga Solar PC’s light-absorbing panel is made up of 84 solar cells featuring a Back Contact cell design. All of the panel’s mounting brackets and electrical contacts that collect and transfer the energy that’s generated are located behind the solar cells. The front of the panel is able to capture more light, allowing Lenovo to achieve a conversion rate – how much of the captured sunlight is converted to usable electricity – of more than 24 percent. That’s more efficient than most of the silicone-based solar panels used in consumer electronics today, but a bit behind panels featuring an added layer of perovskite film on top that can boost light absorption and efficiencies to up to 43 percent. Even at 24 percent efficiency, Lenovo says the Yoga Solar PC’s panel “can absorb and convert enough solar energy from direct sunlight in 20 minutes to power up to one hour of video playback.” The company says it’s still evaluating how much power is produced in conditions with lower light. Powered by an Intel Lunar Lake paired with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, the Yoga Solar PC measures in at 15 millimeters thick and weighs around 2.29 pounds with its 14-inch OLED display. To help ensure users are able to best take advantage of the light available to them – whether indoors or outside – the laptop will also feature Lenovo’s Dynamic Solar Tracking system software showing how much current and voltage the solar panel is producing. For existing Yoga laptop users wanting to reduce their battery anxiety while touching grass, Lenovo also revealed an external solar power kit concept. It’s a standalone solution that opens like a book to reveal a pair of side-by-side solar panels that can be attached to a backpack or stand on its own with a fold-out kickstand. It can connect and deliver power to a device with a USB-C cable, or the sun’s rays can be used to charge an included power bank that can power other devices later. But Lenovo hasn’t announced plans to put it into production yet. Lenovo created the concept to “bridge the gap between functionality and environmental awareness,” giving users easy access to an alternative energy source. You’d need the weather to cooperate for a while to fully charge the Yoga Solar PC using its relatively small solar panel, but it could be a welcome fallback for when a power outlet is nowhere in reach.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/622102/lenovo-thinkpad-x13-gen-6-t14s-2-in-1-laptops-mwc",
    "description": "The ThinkPad X13 Gen 6 is very easy to hold in one hand. Lenovo may have some cool new flippy-screened and solar-powered laptops it’s showing off at Mobile World Congress this year, but it’s also announcing the generational notebook updates you’ll actually be able to buy within the coming months. Some of the new models include a redesigned and super lightweight ThinkPad X13 notebook, the first T-Series convertible 2-in-1 with the ThinkPad T14s, and a refreshed ThinkBook 16p workstation. First, we have the newest 13.3-inch ThinkPad X13, now Gen 6, that sits as Lenovo’s ultraportable slim business laptop. This time, Lenovo managed to reduce its weight even further from 2.25 pounds on the Gen 5 to just 2.05 pounds (although it could get heavier in some configurations). In comparison, Apple’s lightest M3 MacBook Air weighs 2.7 pounds.&nbsp; Lenovo is also adding AMD Ryzen AI Pro 300 series processor options alongside Intel (up to Core Ultra 7). You can configure the X13 with up to 16GB LPDDR5 RAM and 2TB SSD, and a replaceable battery option of either 41Wh or 54.7Wh. The Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen 6 will be available in North America starting June 2025 with an expected starting price of $1,139. Next, Lenovo is turning its T14s notebook it announced last year into a 2-in-1. It has a 14-inch WUXGA touchscreen with up to 500 nits of brightness, and you can configure the device with up to an Intel Core Ultra 7, 64GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. The T14s comes with an option for a Wi-Fi 7 upgrade and optional 5G connectivity, plus there’s a user replaceable 58Wh battery. Ports include two Thunderbolt 4, two 5Gbps USB-A, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, SIM, and an audio jack. The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s 2-in-1 will be available in North America starting June 2025 with an expected starting price of $1,719. The notebook version will launch alongside the 2-in-1 as well, and will start at $1,674. Lenovo is also announcing a (not for North America) new desktop replacement ThinkBook 16p Gen 6 that has a high 180W system TDP that can also boost to 200W in “Geek Mode.” With that energy, the laptop can power its discrete NPU, up to Intel Core Ultra 9 mobile processors and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, and up to 64GB DDR5 RAM for AI tasks, rendering, and more. For ports, it has two Thunderbolt 4, two 5Gbps USB-A, one 10Gbps USB-A, HDMI 2.1, SD Card reader, SIM slot, and audio jack. It also has a 16-inch 3.2K IPS display, Wi-Fi 7, and a fingerprint reader. Finally, in May, Lenovo will launch the ThinkPad T14 Gen 6 and T16 Gen 4 (both with Ryzen Pro AI 300 or Intel Core Ultra) in North America, with prices expected to be $1,359 and $1,623 respectively. And sometime in Q2 this year, it will also launch the affordable ThinkPad E14 Gen 7 for $849 and E16 Gen 3 for $859, as well as the ThinkBook 14 2-in-1 Gen 5 for $1,374.",

    "title": "Lenovo’s concept laptop add-ons include multiple monitors and an emoji friend",
    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/622379/lenovo-magic-bay-thinkbook-16p-modular-display-tiko-pro-emoji-concepts",
    "description": "Come for the multi-monitor power user setup, but stay for the emoji friend in a cat case (trust me, it has a tail). Lenovo is throwing ideas at the wall with new modular accessories for the magnetic Magic Bay connector of its ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 laptop. The company announced at Mobile World Congress four different proof-of-concept add-ons that may or may never be released, and they’re as cool as they are quirky: Magic Bay 2nd Display Concept : an 8-inch vertical screen for easy view of feeds Magic Bay Dual Screen Concept : a pair of 13.3-inch 120Hz 2.8K displays for a triple-monitor setup Magic Bay “codename Tiko” Concept : a small, round display for an emoji-based AI companion Magic Bay “codename Tiko Pro” Concept : a slim horizontal display for widgets and Lenovo’s AI Now integration There aren’t many details on the concepts, though the 2nd Display and Dual Screen are the most straightforward. They’re meant for people who want a mobile multi-monitor setup that doesn’t require a secondary device to plug in or keep charged. The 2nd Display is like attaching an 8-inch iPad Mini to your laptop, with a vertical orientation that could be great for social feeds and communication apps like Slack or Microsoft Teams. It has a 1920 x 1200 resolution 60Hz panel, which is plenty of resolution for a small screen. The Dual Screen Concept takes the ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 and turns it into a triple-monitor setup. The two attachable displays are each 13.3 inches with 2880 x 1920 resolution and 120 Hz refresh. They weigh a hefty 2.62 pounds / 1.2kg, nearly as heavy as carrying a 13-inch MacBook Air with your ThinkBook. I saw this setup and the 2nd Display Concept in an early in-person preview, and while having a triple-monitor laptop ready on-demand seemed awesome, it was also just A Lot. The Dual Screen Concept was cumbersome to set up, fold down, and put away. On the other hand, the 2nd Display was easy to work with and felt like a no-brainer if it ever comes to market. As for the pair of Tiko concepts, I didn’t get to see them but oh boy are these such different ideas sharing the same name. Lenovo doesn’t have many details yet on the Tiko Pro horizontal screen attachment, but having an additional display for widgets seems nifty. I bet its teleprompter function would sell many units on that sole feature. But the Tiko emoji friend looks like an absolute charmer. It’s a circular screen to display what Lenovo calls, “A compact AI emotional interaction companion” that “helps users stay informed and engaged throughout their workday.” I’m all about emojis, and this is an emoji buddy you can attach to your laptop. It looks similar to the aptly-named AI Buddy Lenovo showed at its recent Tech World Conference, which was designed for a desktop. The Buddy was a voice-enabled AI chatbot that could also take actions on your computer for you. The Tiko Pro, at least based on Lenovo’s early indications, seems more like a lighthearted plaything you can casually interact with. For example, you can make a heart hand gesture at it and it’ll react with hearts, and you can put it in a cute cat case — complete with a tail! I don’t know why the business-focused ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 is simultaneously the platform for multi-monitor features for power users and a digital equivalent to an emotional support animal, but I’m here for it regardless. Let’s see if any of these concepts survive the cutting room floor.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/622380/lenovo-thinkbook-flip-concept-laptop-foldable-mwc",
    "description": "This laptop’s screen climbs high without the need for motors. Lenovo has another funky experiment it’s announcing at Mobile World Congress : the ThinkBook “codename Flip” AI PC Concept. It’s a productivity / business laptop with a flexible display, allowing it to be used as a traditional 13.1-inch clamshell, a folded-up 12.9-inch tablet, or a laptop with an extra-tall 18.1-inch vertical screen. The ThinkBook Flip uses the same exact OLED panel as the $3,500 ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 that’s expected to arrive sometime in June — only here, it’s set up to fold behind the main portion of the screen instead of extend out from underneath it. That means there are no motors, which could bring costs down, and none of the display is left sitting unused inside the chassis — hence the Flip’s 0.4 inches of extra screen real estate over the Gen 6. When folded back, the Flip can be used like a normal 13-inch clamshell laptop, albeit with nearly half its screen facing backward. You can use that rear-facing portion to mirror or extend your display and present to someone else without the need for an external monitor or projector, or just leave it blank. But the real star of the show is when you flip the screen up to get all 18.1 inches / 2000 x 2664 resolution of glorious OLED for yourself. In addition to being able to view long documents and websites, it puts the webcam and top portion of the screen at a pleasing and neck-relieving eye level. @verge Lenovo is demo’ing a foldable laptop screen concept that lets you to bend the display for a double-sided mode, a tablet mode, or just to utilize a really tall 18&#8243; screen. #lenovo #foldable #laptop #concept #tech #techtok ♬ original sound &#8211; The Verge Outside of its screen, the Flip’s other unique feature is its Smart ForcePad trackpad. It offers three color-coded layers of LED-illuminated touch shortcuts and media controls you can call up within the pad itself. They can transform the trackpad into a number pad, offer shortcuts to functions like the Snipping Tool or a mute button for your mic, or serve as an app launcher. Samuel Shang, principal researcher of Lenovo Research, told me the company’s dream setup would be to replace the touchpad with a smartphone display, but that would be too costly. The basic illuminated icons offered a fair compromise. While the Flip is still in the concept phase, Lenovo does have some estimated specs for what would go inside, which seems like a promising sign this laptop will actually come to market. It’ll use an Intel Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, PCIe SSD storage, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and feature a fingerprint reader. The ThinkBook Flip I got to see in a brief demo ahead of MWC was an early prototype that still felt fragile and a little rough around the edges. It was far from the ready-to-ship rollable ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 I saw at CES, which I didn’t have to treat so delicately. But my colleague Allison Johnson saw another prototype of the Flip in Barcelona at MWC that already looked a little further along and less janky. There’s always a chance that this concept never goes beyond the prototype phase, but since it’s borrowing components from the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, the odds may be in its favor. The Flip may make sense as an alternate offering if its lack of motors means it can be offered at a lower price than its rollable cousin. I know I personally always want to see more funky laptops, and it’d be cool to get multiple flavors of these tall boys.",

    "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/622538/trump",
    "description": "In a pair of social media posts today, President Donald Trump named some cryptocurrencies he says will be part of a Crypto Strategic Reserve being created by an executive order he signed in January. Those include Bitcoin and Ether, which he says “will be the heart of the Reserve.” Trump said in the first of his two Truth Social posts that his order “directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve” that also includes XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Trump hinted at such a reserve on the campaign trail, telling attendees of a crypto conference last year that the US would never sell its Bitcoin holdings. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has quickly backed away from the wary stance toward cryptocurrencies it held prior to Trump’s inauguration this year. The agency has recently dropped multiple investigations and lawsuits against cryptocurrency firms that alleged securities violations. One of the currencies Trump mentioned today, Ripple’s XRP, was the subject of a 2020 SEC lawsuit in which a judge ruled that it functioned as an unregistered security, but only when Ripple sold it to institutional investors. The SEC appealed that decision in October last year ; as of this writing, that appeal is ongoing.",

    "description": "日本厚生劳动发布的人口动态统计显示，2024 年日本的出生人数刷新历史最低纪录，结婚对数也降至战后第二低。日本政府推行的“异次元少子化对策”未能在首年度扭转局面。除了处于生育适龄期的人口减少之外，未婚化和晚婚化因素也导致少子化速度比预想的更快。日本 2024 年的出生人数比 2023 年减少 5.0%。减幅比新冠疫情前的 2016 至 2019年（年均减少 3.7%）更高。2024 年出生人数仅为 72 万人；2024 年的结婚对数为 49 万 9999 对，同比增长 2.2%，2 年来首次高于上年，但仍处于历史最低水平。",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/amd-ceo-career-question-lisa-su-what-do-you-want-2025-3",
    "description": "Lisa Su uses one early career question to make decisions as AMD&#39;s chief. AMD AMD&#39;s CEO Lisa Su said she still uses a question her bosses asked when she was early in her career. Su said bosses at IBM asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up. Su&#39;s leadership kept AMD&#39;s focus on high-performance computers and gaming. The CEO of $162 billion chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices said that one early career question helped her make big decisions at the once-struggling company. As a junior employee at Texas Instruments and IBM in the mid-1990s, Lisa Su said she was lucky to have bosses who asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up &mdash; and she realized she wanted to manage people and projects. Nearly two decades later, she asked herself that same question about AMD when she landed a leadership role at the chipmaker during a tumultuous time in the company&#39;s history. Deciding what AMD wanted to be long term &mdash; &#34;when we grow up&#34; &mdash; was key, she said during a talk at Stanford Graduate Business School uploaded online on Thursday. &#34;Decisions that we make today, you will really see the impact three to five years down the road,&#34; she said. Su said that when she worked as AMD&#39;s chief operating officer in 2014, the company evaluated building smartphone chips, which were taking off at the time. &#34;That is a good business, but that actually is not a good business for us because that&#39;s not fundamentally what we are best at,&#34; she said in Thursday&#39;s talk. The company opted to prioritize building high-performance computers. Su joined AMD as a senior vice president of global business units in 2012, after about 18 years in the semiconductor industry. She said the company was at a &#34;crossroads&#34; and her mentors advised her not to join AMD because it had &#34;a track record of not perfect execution.&#34; After a six-month stint as COO, she was asked to become the company&#39;s CEO in October 2014. At the time, the company&#39;s stock was trading at around $3 a share, and it was rumored to be on the verge of bankruptcy due to intense competition from Intel and Nvidia . Su is credited for turning the company around. She led AMD to diversify its business beyond personal computers and into gaming consoles and designed new chips. In 2018, AMD replaced GlobalFoundries with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company as its main manufacturing partner. AMD&#39;s stock, which peaked at nearly $200 a year ago, was worth $100 on Monday. The fall in the last year came largely from underwhelming revenue data.

The event had memorable musical performances, wins, and speeches. &#34;Anora&#34; won the Oscar for best picture, the biggest award of the night. The 97th Academy Awards were full of show-stopping performances and memorable Oscar wins. &#34;Anora&#34; was the biggest winner of the night with five Academy Awards including best picture. Oscars viewership has declined over the past decade &mdash; around 43.7 million people watched the Academy Awards in 2014 compared to 19.5 million in 2024 &mdash; but this year, audiences were promised a new host and a new way to watch: The ceremony streamed live on Hulu for the first time. However, once the show got underway on Sunday, Hulu&#39;s streaming service glitched for users several times throughout the night. When some users were unable to log in to watch the show, Hulu Support wrote on X that it had &#34;identified the issue and users affected should be able to log back in again soon.&#34; Others experienced an abrupt end of the broadcast just before the award for best actress was announced, leaving some viewers unable to watch the final two awards of the night. A representative for Hulu did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider. Here&#39;s a recap of the biggest moments.

    "description": "&#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; actors Adriana Paz, Edgar Ramírez, Selena Gomez, Karla Sofía Gascón, and Zoe Saldaña and director Jacques Audiard at the Golden Globes. Amy Sussman/Getty Images Netflix&#39;s &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; received the most nominations from major award bodies this season. Over the last three months, the film and its cast have faced multiple controversies on social media. In the latest crisis, fans are attacking the film&#39;s lead, Karla Sofía Gascón, for her old social media posts. &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; was a frontrunner for the 2025 Oscars after bagging 13 nominations, but a growing number of fans and critics began turning against the film after a spate of controversies. The Netflix movie, starring Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez , and Karla Sofía Gascón, is a cross-genre crime musical about a Mexican cartel boss who fakes her death so she can transition. Variety reported that Netflix bought the film for about $12 million after it premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. While it wasn&#39;t a hit on the platform, its award success is a boost to Netflix&#39;s reputation. Some film fans questioned why the movie is drawing so many accolades, arguing its competition is better, and have criticized old social media posts by its lead actor, Gascón. On Rotten Tomatoes, it had a critic score of 72% and an audience score of 16%, indicating a divide between industry experts and the general public. Here&#39;s what to know about the controversies surrounding the film. A sex-change song and Selena Gomez&#39;s performance drew ridicule In one scene that went viral, a doctor sings about the gender reassignment surgeries he has performed. Users on X who saw the clip out of context mocked the musical number, while others who had seen the film called it boring. THIS IS NOT A REAL MOVIE F DSHJDSFHDSFHHJDSF pic.twitter.com/Jjbq7cxTn9 &mdash; chloe 🦋 (@ChloeNumberIII) November 13, 2024 Film fans reignited criticism by resharing the scene after &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; won four awards at the Golden Globes on January 6. It won the award for best musical or comedy motion picture over many fan-favorite films, including &#34; Wicked ,&#34; &#34;The Substance,&#34; and &#34;Challengers.&#34; Gomez&#39;s performance and her Spanish language skills have also been criticized. Eugenio Derbez, a Mexican actor who starred in 2021&#39;s &#34;Coda,&#34; called her performance &#34;indefensible&#34; last December on the Mexican entertainment podcast &#34;Hablando de Cine.&#34; After Gomez said sorry and that she did the best she could with the time she was given, Derbez apologized the next day for his &#34;thoughtless&#34; comments. Some viewers criticized how &#39;Emilia Perez&#39; portrays trans identity Karla Sofía Gomez plays the lead character Emilia Pérez, who transitions in the film. WHY NOT PRODUCTIONS / PATHÉ FILMS / FRANCE 2 CINÉMA / PAGE 114 At first glance, it would seem progressive for a film about a trans person to get multiple Oscar nominations, as an openly trans actor has yet to win an Academy Award. But critics say the film doesn&#39;t uplift the community, partly because it includes transphobic tropes, such as describing a trans woman as &#34;half male/half female.&#34; In November 2024, the LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD called the film &#34;a step backward for trans representation&#34; and shared several negative reviews from critics who are trans. On January 6, Gascón responded to the backlash, telling Vanity Fair that people are &#34;running a negative, nasty campaign&#34; against the movie. &#34;Anything that I say, they will use it to make their case bigger,&#34; she said. &#34;When something has a big impact and is liked by many, others hate it just for existing.&#34; When asked about critics who are trans panning the movie, Gascón said: &#34;Being LGBTQ, having those labels, does not remove your stupidity, just like heterosexuality does not remove your stupidity. &#34;What bothers me is that the people that say things like that just sitting down at home doing nothing. If you don&#39;t like it, go and make your own movie. Go create the representation you want to see for your community.&#34; Gascón added that the trans experience is not a monolith. Juan Barquin, a critic of the movie who is trans and was mentioned in the Vanity Fair article, responded in an X post the next day, telling Gascón to &#34;go fuck herself&#34; and give her money to make her own trans movie. Drew Burnett Gregory, another trans critic mentioned in the piece, also responded. &#34;I&#39;ve watched many trans actors and writers attach themselves to cis artists in the hopes of helping their careers,&#34; he said. &#34;It&#39;s not a position I envy. When the dust settles and the awards are doled out, it&#39;s the cis people who have benefited while the trans people can barely get work.&#34; On January 6, Jeremy O. Harris, a Tony-nominated playwright and actor, shared an Instagram story post criticizing the outlet THEM and other LGBTQ+ detractors of &#34;Emilia Pérez,&#34; arguing its success could open doors for representation. &#39;Emilia Perez&#39; also faced backlash for its portrayal of Mexico Selena Gomez as Jessi in &#34;Emilia Pérez.&#34; Shanna Besson/Page 114 - Why Not Productions - Pathé Films - France 2 Cinéma &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; is mostly set in Mexico, but the film&#39;s director, Jacques Audiard, is French, and the movie was made in France. In addition, one Mexican-born actor has a lead role: Adriana Paz. Gomez is American and has Mexican heritage; Saldaña&#39;s parents are Dominican and Puerto Rican; and Gascón is Spanish. Users on X, including Mexican actors and cinematographers, argued the film doesn&#39;t accurately portray Mexico, its culture, and its people. #EmiliaPérez pic.twitter.com/naL9FAl0ok &mdash; Mauricio Martínez (@martinezmau) January 6, 2025 Rodrigo Prieto , a Mexican, Oscar-nominated cinematographer who worked on &#34;Barbie,&#34; &#34;Killers of the Flower Moon,&#34; and &#34;The Wolf of Wall Street,&#34; told Deadline last November that he was &#34;unhappy&#34; the film was not shot in Mexico and didn&#39;t include more Mexican people in the production. &#34;The whole thing is completely inauthentic,&#34; Prieto said. &#34;Yes, they had dialogue coaches but I was offended that such a story was portrayed in a way that felt so inauthentic. &#34;It was just the details for me. You would never have a jail sign that read &#39;Cárcel&#39; it would be &#39;Penitenciaria&#39;. It&#39;s just the details, and that shows me that nobody that knew was involved. And it didn&#39;t even matter. That was very troubling to me.&#34; In December 2024, casting director Carla Hool told a SAG-AFTRA foundation Q&amp;A that her team searched across Mexico and Latin America for the lead roles. &#34;We wanted to keep it really authentic, but at the end of the day, the best actors who embodied the characters are the ones right here,&#34; Hool said, adding that they changed the backgrounds of Gomez and Saldaña&#39;s characters because they aren&#39;t native Mexicans. This further angered critics. &#39;Emilia Pérez&#39; was snubbed by GLAAD but received the most Oscar nominations of any film this year On January 22, GLAAD announced the nominees for its media awards, but &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; was notably absent from all categories. A day later, the Oscars announced their nominations list, and &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; received the most. The film&#39;s total nominations tied with Oscar-winning films such as &#34;Oppenheimer,&#34; &#34;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,&#34; and &#34;Forrest Gump.&#34; Ultimately, on Oscars night, &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; won two of its nominated awards: best supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, and best original song for &#34;El Mal.&#34; &#39;Emilia Perez&#39; spawned a French-set parody film, &#39;Johanne Sacreblue&#39; On January 25, Camila Aurora, a Mexican filmmaker who is trans, uploaded &#34;Johanne Sacreblu&#34; to YouTube, a 28-minute musical parody of &#34;Emilia Pérez.&#34; The film is set in France, but it is filled with French stereotypes and was filmed in Mexico with Mexican actors who put on bad French accents. The film went viral and has been viewed over 3 million times on YouTube. Karla Sofía Gascón accused people on social media of trying to tear her down Karla Sofía Gascón attends the 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025 Amy Sussman/Getty Images On January 28, Folha de S. Paulo, a Brazilian daily newspaper, published a video interview where Gascón said people had torn down her work to highlight that of fellow best actress Oscar nominee, Fernanda Torres. Fans accused Gascón of breaking an Academy rule prohibiting those associated with an eligible film from publicly casting a competing film in a &#34;negative or derogatory light.&#34; Representatives for the Academy did not respond to a comment request from Business Insider. Variety reported on January 29 that the comments do not violate the rule because Gascón did not negatively comment on Torres&#39; acting performance or film. &#34;In my recent comments, I was referencing the toxicity and violent hate speech on social media that I sadly continue to experience,&#34; Gascón told Variety . &#34;Fernanda has been a wonderful ally, and no one directly associated with her has been anything but supportive and hugely generous.&#34; Karla Sofia Gascon&#39;s racist tweets resurfaced, to more backlash Zoe Saldaña as Rita Moro Castro and Karla Sofía Gascón as Emilia Pérez in &#34;Emilia Pérez.&#34; Netflix On January 30, fans and journalists resurfaced posts Gascón shared on X featuring offensive remarks about Islam, Muslims, George Floyd, and Miley Cyrus. The most recent posts were from 2021. Variety reported that in one post, which has since been deleted, Gascón called the 2021 Oscar ceremony an &#34;Afro-Korean festival&#34; after Daniel Kaluuya , a Black British actor, and Yuh-Jung Youn, a South Korean actor, won awards. &#34;I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt,&#34; Gascón said in a statement to Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. &#34;As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.&#34; On January 31, Gascón deleted her X account and shared a lengthy statement with The Hollywood Reporter. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect neither my family nor me anymore, so at their request I am closing my account on X,&#34; it read. Gascón went on to post several additional statements on Instagram and appeared in an hourlong interview with CNN en Español. In these posts and interviews, Gascón denied she was racist or Islamophobic and said some of the posts were fake or taken out of context. On January 31, while attending a Q&amp;A in London that Gascón did not appear at, Saldaña was asked to respond to &#34;what&#39;s been said online.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m still processing everything that has transpired in the last couple of days, and I&#39;m sad,&#34; Saldaña replied. &#34;It makes me really sad because I don&#39;t support and I don&#39;t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.&#34; On February 9, Gomez attended a Q&amp;A at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where she was asked how she was doing following the chaos of this award season. &#34;I&#39;m really good. Some of the magic has disappeared, but I choose to continue to be proud of what I&#39;ve done, and I&#39;m just grateful and live with no regrets,&#34; Gomez said. &#34;And I would do this movie over and over again if I could.&#34; Director Jacques Audiard disavowed Gascón in an interview as Netflix seems to distance itself from the star Jacques Audiard attending a press conference for &#39;Emilia Pérez&#39; in January in Mexico City. Medios y Media/Getty Images In early February, Variety reported that Netflix had released a new &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; poster for award show voters that features the film&#39;s stars and nominations, except for Gascón and her Oscar nod. Awards panels for the Oscars and others haven&#39;t finished voting, so the controversy may affect the film&#39;s chances of winning awards. On February 5, Audiard told Deadline that Gascón&#39;s old posts were &#34;inexcusable&#34; and said she was &#34;playing the victim.&#34; &#34;I haven&#39;t spoken to her, and I don&#39;t want to. She is in a self-destructive approach that I can&#39;t interfere in, and I really don&#39;t understand why she&#39;s continuing,&#34; he said, seemingly referring to Gascón&#39;s response to the backlash. Audiard said that Gascón&#39;s response to the backlash was hurting him, her castmates, and everyone else who worked on the film. When asked about &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; being criticized for its depictions of cartels and victims of gang violence in Mexico, Audiard said the movie was not intended to be realistic. &#34;The representation of the cartels in the film is thematic. It&#39;s not something that I&#39;m particularly focused on in the film,&#34; Audiard said. There&#39;s one scene that deals with it. The real thing that I&#39;m interested in, that I was interested in doing, is that I wanted to make an opera.&#34; While some social media users praised Audiard for criticizing Gascón, others accused him of throwing her to the wolves and criticized comments Audiard made about the Spanish language that they believed were problematic. After the interview, Gascón shared one more post, this time in English, in which she said she understood Audiard&#39;s comments and would no longer speak out in defense of herself or the film. &#34;I sincerely apologize to everyone who has been hurt along the way,&#34; Gascón ended the post. Gascón laid low for the remainder of awards season. She stayed away from most public events, including the BAFTAs, where &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; took home the award for best film not in the English language and best supporting actress for Saldaña. Though Gascón did not attend the BAFTAs ceremony, both Saldaña and Audiard thanked her while listing the other cast and crew who helped make &#34;Emilia Pérez.&#34; &#34;To you, my dear Karla Sofia, that I kiss,&#34; Audiard said in French, as translated by an onstage translator. Gascón reemerged to attend the 97th Academy Awards on March 2, where she was nominated for best actress. She laughed gamely as Conan O&#39;Brien made an awkward joke about her controversial tweets while she was seated in the audience. A Netflix exec called the &#39;Emilia Perez&#39; scandal &#39;a bummer&#39; In an interview on The Town podcast with Puck&#39;s Matthew Bellonii released on February 14, Netflix&#39;s chief content officer Bela Bajaria addressed Gascón&#39;s controversy. The exec repeatedly stressed that it was unfortunate how the backlash had affected the other people who worked on &#34;Emilia Pérez,&#39;&#34; calling it &#34;such a bummer.&#34; When Belloni asked if this incident would change how Netflix vets talent&#39;s social media for future projects, Bajaria said that they would be reevaluating it, but stressed how logistically challenging it would be to &#34;actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousands of people, every single day around the world,&#34; given the sheer volume of content Netflix is producing and licensing. Despite everything that happened, Bajaria told Belloni she still stands behind the film. &#34;If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today. That movie is incredible and it&#39;s creative and it&#39;s bold &mdash; that&#39;s what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.&#34; Representatives for Gascón, Netflix, the Academy, and THEM did not immediately respond to a comment request from BI.

    "title": "The Oscars snubbed Michelle Trachtenberg and other actors from the 'In Memoriam.' Getting featured is harder than you think.",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/oscars-in-memoriam-2025-michelle-trachtenberg-snubbed-2025-3",
    "description": "Michelle Trachtenberg, Tony Todd, and Olivia Hussey were among the perceived snubs. Gabe Ginsberg/Getty; JC Olivera/WireImage/Getty; Ron Galella Collection via Getty Image Several actors were left out of the 2025 Oscars In Memoriam segment. Fans are particularly upset that Michelle Trachtenberg and Tony Todd were snubbed. People are always left out because of limited space and who chooses the In Memoriam list. It&#39;s that time of year again &mdash; time to be mad about the people left off of the In Memoriam segment at the Oscars . Without fail, the annual montage that pays tribute to Hollywood&#39;s fallen courts controversy. As only a few minutes of the hourslong ceremony, there are always names missing from the list; it&#39;s simply impossible to include everyone with a film credit who has died. This year was no exception, and viewers were particularly angry about a few of them. Most noteworthy was the omission of Michelle Trachtenberg . The 39-year-old &#34;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#34; star, who had her breakout film role as a child actor in &#34;Harriet the Spy,&#34; died on Wednesday. While you might think the recency of her death simply means the In Memoriam editors didn&#39;t have time to add her, that&#39;s not the case. Gene Hackman , whose death was announced after Trachtenberg&#39;s, was prominently featured in the closing moments of the montage and spotlighted in the introduction by his friend and costar Morgan Freeman. Several other noteworthy actors were excluded from this year&#39;s In Memoriam, including &#34;Candyman&#34; actor Tony Todd, &#34;Beverly Hills 90210&#34; and &#34;Heathers&#34; star Shannen Doherty, &#34;Titanic&#34; and &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; star Bernard Hill, and &#34;Black Christmas&#34; and the 1968 &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; star Olivia Hussey. How the Academy decides who gets into the In Memoriam segment There&#39;s no simple formula for determining whether someone makes it into the Oscars In Memoriam tribute. The montage includes a mix of on-screen talent, writers and directors, and below-the-line folks, meaning there&#39;s no shortage of potential honorees to choose from. So, how does the list get curated? As it turns out, the executive producers of the awards show aren&#39;t the ones who have that task. According to The Hollywood Reporter , it&#39;s the job of a secret executive committee which is composed of members from all 19 of the Academy&#39;s branches. Michael Schulman, an Academy Awards expert who wrote the book &#34;Oscar Wars,&#34; told THR that the composition of the committee is also a reason why a recognizable actor like Shannen Doherty may have been passed over in favor of a less commonly known cinematographer. Being prominent specifically in film (not TV or another medium) is also a factor, albeit a very subjective one. A source close to the Academy told THR that people who have won Oscars or a Governors Award have priority, then those who have won the Academy&#39;s Scientific and Technical Awards. Nominees for those awards are in the next tier for consideration. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Sunday that the department&#39;s civilian employees had to &#34;comply with OPM&#39;s email directive.&#34; Omar Marques via Getty Images Pete Hegseth said the Defense Department&#39;s civilian workers must reply to DOGE&#39;s productivity email. The Defense Department initially told workers to &#34;pause any response&#34; to the request. Hegseth said on Sunday that the DoD reviewed its procedures and decided that workers can respond. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the department&#39;s civilian employees must comply with the Department of Government Efficiency&#39;s request for a list of their work accomplishments. &#34;I am now directing each member of the department&#39;s civilian workforce, just civilian, to provide those five bullets on what they accomplished in their specific jobs last week, to reply to that email and cc their immediate supervisor,&#34; Hegseth said in a video posted on X on Sunday. Last week, the Defense Department told its workers to &#34; pause any response &#34; to the Office of Personnel Management&#39;s summary email request. The DoD wrote in an X post on February 23 that it &#34;is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures.&#34; In his Sunday announcement, Hegseth said the change in directive came after the Defense Department reviewed its procedures and consulted with the OPM. These checks were necessary because the department handles sensitive topics of national security, he added. &#34;We needed to be careful on that front,&#34; Hegseth said in his video. I am now directing each member of the department’s civilian federal workforce to provide 5 bullets of what they accomplished last week and comply with OPM’s email directive. https://t.co/BJOoEvVTza &mdash; Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (@SecDef) March 2, 2025 When approached for comment, a representative for the Defense Department said civilian employees would be given instructions on how to respond to OPM&#39;s email on Monday. &#34;It&#39;s a simple task, really, as Elon said, as the president recognized in our first cabinet meeting. Just a pulse check,&#34; Hegseth said on Sunday. Hegseth said the department&#39;s civilian employees should respond without providing any &#34;classified or sensitive information&#34; and give only &#34;basic topics of what you did last week.&#34; Hegseth added that the reports will be &#34;consolidated internally within the department to comply with the OPM&#39;s directive.&#34; &#34;Much appreciated @SecDef Hegseth!&#34; Elon Musk , who is closely associated with the White House DOGE office, wrote in an X post in response to Hegseth&#39;s video. DOGE&#39;s productivity email push On February 22, OPM emailed federal employees, asking them to submit their work accomplishments by 11:59 p.m. ET on February 24. Musk initially said on February 22 that failure to comply &#34;will be taken as a resignation. But, on February 24, he said that workers who did not respond would be given &#34;another chance.&#34; On Friday, OPM told federal employees they would be expected to submit a list of their work accomplishments&nbsp; every week . The email request came after Musk said on Wednesday that DOGE would &#34; send another email &#34; after getting a &#34;partial response.&#34; The White House said on Tuesday that over a million workers had responded to OPM&#39;s first email, less than half of the entire government. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t say that we are thrilled about it,&#34; President Donald Trump said of the response rate during a press conference on Wednesday. &#34;You got a lot of people that have not responded, so we are trying to figure out, do they exist? Who are they? And it&#39;s possible that a lot of those people will be actually fired,&#34; Trump said at the same press conference. Read the original article on Business Insider",

Sean Baker&#39;s &#34;Anora&#34; won 5 Oscars, including best picture, best actress, and best director. &#34;The Brutalist&#34; came in second with 3 wins, including a best actor win for Adrien Brody. Sean Baker and his movie &#34;Anora&#34; were the big winners at the 97th Academy Awards. The acclaimed movie won five Oscars, including four won by Baker himself &mdash; editing, screenwriting, directing, and best picture. The only other person to win four Oscars at a single Academy Awards is Walt Disney in 1954. ( Bong Joon Ho won four for &#34;Parasite&#34; in 2020 , but best international feature is technically awarded to the country, not the makers of the film.) &#34;Anora&#34; also caused the biggest upset of the night when its lead, Mikey Madison, won best actress over favorite Demi Moore , who won a Golden Globe and SAG Award for her performance in &#34;The Substance.&#34; &#34;The Brutalist&#34; won three Oscars, including best actor for Adrien Brody. This is his second Oscar win; he won in the same category for &#34;The Pianist&#34; in 2003. Here&#39;s the full list of nominees, with winners in bold.

Kevin Mazur/Kevin Mazur/Getty Images Colman Domingo attended the 2025 Oscars in a custom red-and-black look by Valentino. He paired the statement suit with a made-to-order Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch. The accessory, set with baguette-cut diamonds, reportedly cost $160,000. Colman Domingo wore a statement-making watch for his big night at the Oscars. Domingo, 55, is nominated for best actor for his performance in &#34;Sing Sing,&#34; about a group of incarcerated men who stage a play in prison. He looked every bit the leading man for the awards ceremony, arriving in a custom Valentino suit designed by the brand&#39;s creative director Alessandro Michele and styled by Wayman + Micah. None of Domingo&#39;s accessories stood out as much as his Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch in 18-karat Canopus Gold. Colman Domingo wore a custom Omega watch to the Oscars. Lexie Moreland/WWD via Getty Images The made-to-order watch was set with baguette-cut diamonds, making it even more valuable. According to the Omega website, the style of watch has been &#34;a part of all six moon landings .&#34; GQ reported the custom piece cost a whopping $160,000. His stylists did not immediately return a request for comment. Colman Domingo wore a luxury watch with his custom suit. Frazer Harrison/WireImage/Getty Images A staple brand of the luxury watch world, Omega is also worn by Silicon Valley tech icons , including Jeff Bezos . Its parent company, Swatch, said in January that stronger sales in the US market stand in contrast to a slower China market.

A red button-down, black pants, and black Valentino Garavani Bowow Loafers completed the look. Domingo was just one of the best-dressed men at the 2025 Oscars who experimented with colorful suits, though he elevated his ensemble with luxury accessories beyond the Omega watch. Red-tinted sunglasses brought a fun edge. Domingo also wore jewelry from Maison Boucheron, including a bracelet from the brand&#39;s private collection, a brooch, a cat ring, and diamond stud earrings.

    "description": "Conan O&#39;Brien onstage at the 2025 Oscars. Kevin Winter/Getty Images Conan O&#39;Brien hosted the Oscars on Sunday. It was the comedian&#39;s first time hosting the Academy Awards. In his monologue, he made fun of best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who was in the audience. Hosting the Oscars is a famously difficult gig. But Conan O&#39;Brien didn&#39;t play it safe in his 2025 Oscars monologue, bringing up one of the biggest controversies of awards season: &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; star Karla Sofía Gascón&#39;s old social media posts . O&#39;Brien set up the joke by saying that the titular character in &#34;Anora,&#34; one of the Oscar-nominated films, uses the F-word &#34;479 times&#34; in the movie. &#34;That&#39;s three more than the record set by Karla Sofía Gascón&#39;s publicist,&#34; the comedian said. The audience responded with shocked laughter before O&#39;Brien pointed out that Gascón, who was nominated for best actress for her role in &#34;Emilia Pérez,&#34; was present in the audience. Gascón was a good sport, laughing along as the camera cut to her. &#34;And Karla, if you are gonna tweet about the Oscars, remember my name is Jimmy Kimmel,&#34; O&#39;Brien joked, referencing the four-time Oscars host. Gascón faced backlash when old tweets re-emerged on X (formerly Twitter) in late January after she suggested fans of another best actress Oscar competitor, &#34;I&#39;m Still Here&#34; star Fernanda Torres, were attempting to tear her down. The posts contained offensive remarks about everything from Muslims and George Floyd to Miley Cyrus. Gascón apologized for her &#34;erroneous&#34; past opinions and deleted her X account. After posting several statements defending herself on Instagram and speaking out in an interview about the controversy, she largely stepped out of the spotlight during the remainder of awards season, keeping a low profile until Oscar night. Conan O&#39;Brien&#39;s Oscars monologue also poked fun at &#39;The Substance,&#39; Timothée Chalamet&#39;s yellow suit, and AI The 97th Academy Awards started off with a movie montage in tribute to Los Angeles after the devastating wildfires, followed by a trio of musical numbers: first, &#34;Wicked&#34; star Ariana Grande sang &#34;Over the Rainbow,&#34; then her costar Cynthia Erivo performed &#34;Home&#34; from &#34;The Wiz.&#34; Then the two transitioned into &#34;Defying Gravity&#34; from their hit movie musical. After the performances, O&#39;Brien finally showed up &mdash; emerging from Demi Moore&#39;s split-open back in a pre-taped skit spoofing her film &#34;The Substance.&#34; He joked that he lost his car keys back in Moore&#39;s inert body. In the monologue after the Gascón joke, O&#39;Brien went on to assure the audience that no AI was used in the making of the Oscars, a subtle jab at the controversies &#34;The Brutalist&#34; and &#34;Emilia Pérez&#34; faced for their use of the technology. He also poked fun at the long runtime of &#34;The Brutalist,&#34; saying &#34;I didn&#39;t want it to end, and luckily, it didn&#39;t.&#34; O&#39;Brien next turned his attention to Timothée Chalamet , who was nominated for playing Bob Dylan in the biopic &#34;A Complete Unknown.&#34; Chalamet, who was seated in the audience next to his girlfriend Kylie Jenner , turned up to the awards show in a butter yellow leather suit. O&#39;Brien complimented the look and joked that the hue assured that the actor wouldn&#39;t be getting hit by any cars. O&#39;Brien packed in no shortage of jokes during the monologue, vowing that he wouldn&#39;t waste any time and cause the ceremony (which famously almost always runs late) to go past its scheduled end time. He then ended by launching into a brief musical number of his own, with lyrics that were all about not wasting our time. During the song, O&#39;Brien threw it to the sand worm from &#34;Dune 2&#34; playing &#34;Chopsticks&#34; on the piano &mdash; and who could possibly argue that was a waste of time?

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/oscars-worst-dressed-red-carpet-looks-2025-3",
    "description": "Monica Barbaro, who played Joan Baez in the Bob Dylan biopic &#34;A Complete Unknown,&#34; attends the 2025 Oscars. Mike Coppola/Getty Images The 2025 Academy Awards were held in Los Angeles on Sunday night. Though there were many best-dressed stars, a few others missed the mark. Elle Fanning&#39;s gown was underwhelming, and Joe Locke wore a suit with too many details. Not every outfit at the 2025 Oscars was a hit. While some stars walked the Academy Awards red carpet in stunning gowns and sharp suits, a few others sported outfits that could have used some tweaks &mdash; or been changed entirely. From Elle Fanning to Whoopi Goldberg, here are the night&#39;s looks that ultimately missed the mark. Meg Ryan Meg Ryan attends the 2025 Oscars. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Though Ryan looked cool and comfortable, a few simple tweaks could have improved her red velvet look. A chic updo would have complemented the elegant style of her strapless gown, and thinner shoes would have clashed less with its heavy fabric. Mikey Madison Mikey Madison attends the 2025 Oscars. Arturo Holmes/Getty Images The &#34;Anora&#34; star&#39;s Dior dress had a black bodice and a pink empire-waist skirt with a bow and a train. The dress was pretty, but ultimately overdone. Numerous stars have worn versions of the same look. Stronger embellishments on the bodice or a different color combination could have enhanced the ensemble. Ethan Slater Ethan Slater at the 2025 Oscars. Monica Schipper/Getty Images The &#34;Wicked&#34; star walked the red carpet in a black tuxedo, a white button-down, and a solid tie. He also wore shiny dress shoes. Though his outfit was classic, it was also forgettable &mdash; especially compared to the standout looks worn by other members of the film&#39;s cast. Lily-Rose Depp Lily-Rose Depp attends the 2025 Oscars. Savion Washington/Getty Images Depp embraced the aesthetic of &#34;Nosferatu&#34; in a black lace gown that was custom-made for her by Chanel. That said, the sheer ensemble seemed a bit too casual for the glamorous event. It would have been better for an Oscars after-party. Rachel Zegler Rachel Zegler attends the 2025 Oscars. Gilbert Flores/Getty Images Zegler&#39;s custom Christian Dior gown was pretty, with pearl details and gray tulle. However, its top didn&#39;t seem to fit the &#34;Snow White&#34; star. It also had a visible tan corset piece that could have blended better into the garment. Joe Locke Joe Locke attends the 2025 Oscars. Savion Washington/Getty Images Locke, who is in the Netflix series &#34;Heartstopper,&#34; wore an assortment of colors and pieces that ultimately didn&#39;t work together. They included a white blouse with a matching bowtie, a long vest covered in gold sequins, gray trousers with sharp pleats, and a black suit jacket with tails. Storm Reid Storm Reid attends the 2025 Oscars. Arturo Holmes/Getty Images Reid, best known for &#34;Euphoria,&#34; made a statement in a red Alexandre Vauthier minidress with a matching cape and gold belt. Unfortunately, it looked more like a designer Little Red Riding Hood costume than an Oscar-worthy outfit. Rachel Sennott Rachel Sennott attends the 2025 Oscars. Gilbert Flores/Getty Images The large, pink sequins that decorated Sennott&#39;s strapless gown dated her look. Similarly, her black, knee-length boots didn&#39;t feel cohesive with the dress. Smaller sparkles and more sophisticated accessories could have elevated the ensemble. Sennott recently appeared in &#34;SNL,&#34; the movie about the origins of &#34;Saturday Night Live.&#34; Elle Fanning Elle Fanning attends the 2025 Oscars. Monica Schipper/Getty Images Fanning, who played Bob Dylan&#39;s girlfriend Suze Rotolo in &#34;A Complete Unknown,&#34; is a consistent style star, but her latest Oscars look was underwhelming. Givenchy custom-made her white, sleeveless gown which had a full lace skirt, a black bow belt, and a deep sweetheart neckline. Her Cartier necklace was eye-catching and glamorous, but it made a bigger statement than the rest of her ensemble. Whoopi Goldberg Whoopi Goldberg attends the 2025 Oscars. JC Olivera/Getty Images Christian Siriano designed her Cinderella-esque ballgown. While its off-the-shoulder sleeves and classic silhouette suited Goldberg, its shiny fabric distracted from the overall look. H. E. R. H.E.R. attends the 2025 Oscars. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images The musician chose a statement-making gown in an off-green shade. It was decorated with silver sequins, accessorized with a brown belt, and had a raw hem. Unfortunately, the top of the gown was too prom-like, while its bottom half looked messy and unfinished. Monica Barbaro Monica Barbaro attends the 2025 Oscars. Mike Coppola/Getty Images Barbaro, who starred in &#34;A Complete Unknown,&#34; sported a custom gown from Christian Dior. The dress had potential, but it ultimately fell short. Its full pink skirt was wrinkled, its corseted waist sat just a touch too high, and its sparkling bralette top appeared to be ill-fitting. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "I figured out how to feed my family of 4 on $120 a week with these key sales hacks",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/mom-grocery-shopping-hacks-family-2025-3",
    "description": "The author spends $120 or less a week on groceries to feed her family. Courtesy of the author When my son was a baby, I overdraft our account by buying a $5.99 sweater. Since then, I&#39;ve been budgeting and trying to minimize our spending. I spend $120 on groceries by buying seasonal sales and starting around the perimeter. In one of my most potent memories of early motherhood , I cry while clutching a tiny argyle sweater I bought for my infant son. At $5.99, it seemed an irresistible deal, a chance to hilariously dress my 10-month-old like a baby professor. Who can blame me? My bank, apparently. I&#39;d bought the spontaneous sweater the same day I went grocery shopping, and my faulty math and meager funds had caused me to overdraft . Things had been tight since my husband and I had gone down to one income so I could stay home with our son. Student loans, medical bills, and rent left little behind for groceries and gas. The day I bought that sweater, I learned an important lesson. I knew I had to teach myself some tricks of the grocery store that would save my family money and allow for occasional impulse buys. Even though I work full time now and have a roomier budget, I still use the same shopping habits I developed 13 years ago. These days, on average, I spend around $120 on groceries every week. I pay attention to the sales cycle The trick is hacking the grocery store sales cycle &mdash; or knowing when to buy items when they are at their cheapest. Goods are sold in a pattern called the sales cycle. A savvy shopper will become familiar with that pattern to buy at the most opportune times. Whether you realize it or not, you&#39;re already familiar with these patterns as a buyer: Early Bird Sales introduce a buyer to a new product, whereas Clearance Sales move the product off the shelf to make room for new merchandise. These are examples of sales cycles. Groceries, which must be rotated more frequently than other goods, have an even faster and more consistent sales cycle. Planning to buy something in bulk when it&#39;s on sale will help you save money. The author has a budget of $120 a week to feed her family. Courtesy of the author Many foods are on a six-week sales cycle. If cans of tomato sauce are on sale this week, instead of buying a week&#39;s worth, buy six, and don&#39;t buy canned tomatoes again until they&#39;re back on sale. This is true for most shelf-stable grocery items, including condiments, sauces, cereals, snacks, and baking items. Foods that perish faster, like produce and meat, have even shorter patterns. Many grocery stores are on a three-week meat cycle. Chicken, ground beef, and pork go on sale in a three-week rotation, so instead of buying all three of those items in one grocery shopping trip, I spend our entire meat budget on chicken the week it is on sale. Then, I do the same for ground beef and pork. I package it in smaller batches when I get home from the grocery store, freeze it and then take the meat out to thaw the morning I plan to use it. I tend to be unwilling to pay more than $3 per pound for meat at my rural Montana grocery store because that is the sale price. I buy about 10 to 15 pounds of whatever kind of meat is on sale that week, and my freezer is well used. Produce is on a similar rotation, although it varies from store to store. I typically don&#39;t spend more than $2.50 per pound on fruits and vegetables. I recommend watching the sales ads to learn your store&#39;s sales pattern, and don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions. The people who work at your grocery store are there to help you. The meat department manager can tell you when to expect certain types of meat on sale, and you can ask the produce manager about their rotation. Here are other ways I make sure to stay under budget Shop the perimeter of the store first. When grocery shopping, consider the necessities first: Produce, meat, and dairy. Once you&#39;ve nabbed those items, you&#39;ll know how much money you have left for pantry staples and splurges. Pay attention to other seasonal sales. For example, the day after Valentine&#39;s Day is an excellent time to stock up on chocolate. I use it by chopping it into chunks and adding it to cookies and pastries. Learn how to use one food for multiple purposes. Did you know you can substitute unflavored full-fat Greek Yogurt for sour cream or applesauce for oil in baking? These are not only healthier substitutions; they also reduce the number of items you need to buy at the grocery store. At $6/dozen, eggs are really beginning to seem like a luxury for any budget. I still make eggs on the stove, but when I&#39;m baking, I take a note from my vegan friends and make a flax egg. Mix 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal (ground flaxseed) with 2 1/2 tablespoons of water. Let it set for 5 minutes to thicken. Replace with one egg in baking. Don&#39;t miss markdowns. Like any retail store, grocery stores need items to move off the shelf on clearance. Veggies just past their prime make great soups or roasted dishes. Fruits can be frozen to use later for smoothies or baked goods. Breads and most baked goods also freeze well and can be warmed up for meals at a moment&#39;s notice. Shopping in these rhythms builds up your pantry and freezer. Buying items at their lowest possible price quickly turns into a fun competition with yourself. Congrats, you&#39;ve just gamified grocery shopping. Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Why an Oscars win for films like 'The Brutalist' or 'Emilia Pérez' could accelerate AI's march on Hollywood",
    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/oscars-ai-films-brutalist-emilia-perez-hollywood-2025-3",
    "description": "&nbsp; ANGELA WEISS / AFP Several films that have been nominated at this year&#39;s Academy Awards used AI in some way. Whether they secure trophies at the Oscars could influence how Hollywood views AI moving forward. Some industry insiders say AI is here to stay and are calling for more transparency about its use. Actors, directors, and filmmakers aren&#39;t the only ones with futures at stake at the Academy Awards. The results of Sunday&#39;s Oscars ceremony could also further the industry&#39;s embrace &mdash; or distrust &mdash; of artificial intelligence. Several big-ticket movies up for golden statues this year were created in part with AI, sometimes provoking fierce criticism online. &#34;AI&#34; has become a two-letter dirty word in Hollywood in recent years, provoking pushback from creative types who believe that movie magic should be the product of primarily human &mdash; not digital &mdash; brains. That extends across everything from scriptwriting to voice dubbing. The technology survived the drubbing it endured during the dual strikes of 2023, however, and is now an uninvited guest at the industry&#39;s most glamorous night. &#34;Tonight&#39;s Oscars will be a turning point for AI use in Hollywood,&#34; said Warner Bailey, a former assistant at the Hollywood talent agency WME who has gone on to become a heroic figure for industry workers thanks to his popular Instagram meme account, Assistants vs. Agents. &#34;Whether it&#39;s entertainment or beyond, I think our industry specifically needs to establish clear guidelines&#34; to safeguard &#34;artistic integrity,&#34; he said in a phone interview with Business Insider ahead of the ceremony on Sunday. &#34;AI,&#34; he added, &#34;isn&#39;t going anywhere.&#34; AI&#39;s role in some of this year&#39;s biggest films AI helped bring some of this year&#39;s biggest films to life. According to multiple reports , AI enhanced Karla Sofía Gascón&#39;s voice in &#34;Emilia Pérez.&#34; An advanced form of machine learning is said to have helped give the Fremen their glowy, hypnotic blue eyes in &#34;Dune: Part Two.&#34; AI was also involved in the post-production of &#34;A Complete Unknown.&#34; In January, Dávid Jancsó, the editor of &#34;The Brutalist&#34; &mdash; which follows a Hungarian-Jewish architect and Holocaust survivor &mdash; said that AI helped perfect the lead actors&#39; accents in the film. &#34;I am a native Hungarian speaker, and I know that it is one of the most difficult languages to learn to pronounce,&#34; Jancsó told RedShark News , a publisher focused on film and television, in January. &#34;We also wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference.&#34; His admission prompted scrutiny and online chatter, forcing the director to later clarify that AI was &#34;used in Hungarian language dialogue editing only&#34; and that the filmmakers strived to &#34;preserve the authenticity&#34; of the actors&#39; performances. These instances have generated enough noise that even the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences &mdash; the group behind the awards ceremony &mdash; is reportedly considering adding a requirement for filmmakers to disclose the use of such tools to its Oscars submission guidelines. A representative for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Variety reported that the Academy is expected to release its updated rules for the 2026 ceremony in April. Robert Thompson, a professor and director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, told BI that AI&#39;s use in moviemaking could impact how films are judged. &#34;Whoever is doing nominations or voting in any organization that&#39;s giving out awards is going to have to figure out if they have a zero tolerance for artificial intelligence,&#34; Thompson said. &#34;Or they&#39;re going to look at any performance that has artificial intelligence &mdash; which is going to be more and more as we go along &mdash; and make the judgment accordingly.&#34; These are some of the reasons people like Bailey think the industry and moviegoing audiences need more transparency about AI use. &#34;There&#39;s a growing gray area in defining artistic contribution&#34; as AI&#39;s use becomes more widespread, he said. &#34;Disclosing when and how AI was used doesn&#39;t necessarily diminish a work&#39;s value, but it does provide clarity for audiences, industry professionals, and award committees, especially in the context of institutions like The Academy whose objective is to recognize excellence in the arts.&#34; Why AI is different than other Hollywood tech To be sure, Hollywood is no stranger to technology. Some of the most iconic moments in cinema have only been made possible thanks to greenscreens and computer-generated imagery, or CGI. But that&#39;s different from AI, which doesn&#39;t require manual human inputs to create images or operate like CGI does. The ability of AI to supplant so many parts of the creative process was central to the 2023 actors&#39; and writers&#39; strikes &mdash; schisms that divided the entertainment industry and sent thousands onto the picket lines across Los Angeles and New York. Even their historic efforts to put parameters around AI&#39;s use, however, haven&#39;t been enough to halt its march. So long as investors, financiers, and production companies see money-making potential , Hollywood probably isn&#39;t going to say farewell to AI. Look at Lionsgate, the production company behind titles like &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;La La Land.&#34; Last year, it inked a partnership with Runway, an AI media company, to focus on the &#34;creation and training of a new AI model, customized on Lionsgate&#39;s proprietary catalog,&#34; according to a 2024 press release . So this year&#39;s Oscars might be less about whether Hollywood will embrace AI (that seems inevitable) &mdash; but more about how quickly. Though perhaps a dark experiment, we decided to put the question to the world&#39;s most famous AI, ChatGPT. When asked whether it thinks AI will one day be involved in all moviemaking, it gave a reply with which people like Bailey would likely agree. &#34;AI is already playing a growing role in various aspects of filmmaking, and it&#39;s likely to be involved in nearly all movie productions in some capacity moving forward,&#34; ChatGPT said. But, it continued, adding just one caveat: &#34;Full automation of moviemaking is unlikely, as human creativity and artistic vision remain essential.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-ceo-brian-niccol-changes-6-months-in-pulse-check-2025-2",
    "description": "Brian Niccol has introduced several changes at Starbucks over the past six months. Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is trying to turn the brand around. Challenges include fixing long wait times and issues with the mobile ordering system. Retail and marketing experts say his moves are a step in the right direction. When Brian Niccol stepped into the top job at Starbucks in September, he had a game plan to turn things around. &#34;We&#39;re refocusing on what has always set Starbucks apart &mdash; a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas,&#34; Niccol wrote in an open letter at the time. He dubbed it the &#34;Back to Starbucks&#34; plan. The brand was facing various challenges, including long wait times , flaws in the customer experience , and issues with its mobile ordering system . As Niccol saw it, mobile ordering had chipped away at the brand&#39;s soul. Starbucks&#39; global comparable sales slid by 7% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same period a year before. Its performance was slightly better in the first quarter of 2025, when global comparable sales decreased by 4% year-on-year. &#34;It was trying to command a premium price for an experience that had rapidly deteriorated to being sub-premium, and hence, customers fled,&#34; Dipanjan Chatterjee, a vice president at the New York-based market research company Forrester, told Business Insider. Six months into the job, retail and marketing experts say Niccol is getting a lot right. Jeffrey Towson, the founder of the US and China-based retail consultancy TechMoat Consulting, said Niccol is &#34;revamping the entire customer journey,&#34; which is the &#34;right strategy.&#34; He said Starbucks already has one big advantage &mdash; its retail footprint &mdash; but now, it needs to &#34;revitalize the customer experience and its reputation.&#34; &#34;Real estate trumps brand in retail coffee. Nobody walks an extra two blocks to go to a Tim Horton&#39;s versus a Starbucks. They go to the closest one,&#34; he said. Niccol&#39;s turnaround plan Niccol brought back ceramic mugs for customers dining in the stores. Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images Niccol is trying to rebrand Starbucks as a cozy local coffeehouse where people can hang out. He has brought back ceramic mugs in store for hot drinks, which he said would improve the café experience, and re-introduced self-serve condiment bars. He&#39;s asking baristas to personalize the experience by writing notes to their customers on the cups. Customers are being given refills of brewed coffee . To reduce customer wait times, Niccol has eliminated 30% of its menu offerings and introduced a new mobile ordering system . His goal is to cut wait times to four minutes or less . Chatterjee told BI that due to its size, Starbucks will likely not be able to get to a point where every store feels unique and local. But it&#39;s making the right move by trying to adopt elements from small coffee shops, Chatterjee said. &#34;Lifting elements of the coffee house experience and weaving them into the Starbucks journey, like the ceramic mugs and the doodling, does enough to reduce the sterility of a chain store,&#34; he said. Niccol has also made staffing changes. On Monday, the company announced it would be laying off 1,100 employees. In an open letter , Niccol wrote that Starbucks is &#34;simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams.&#34; A Starbucks representative told BI that the brand is testing changes to its staffing, processes, and new mobile ordering algorithm to improve its wait times. The representative added that the chain would add more seating to its cafés to improve the in-store experience and start introducing shelves and risers to separate the café and mobile ordering sections. Execution, consistency, and training Mobile ordering is one of the big bottlenecks in Starbucks&#39; service that Niccol is trying to improve. : Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Hal Hershfield, a professor of marketing, behavioral decision-making, and psychology at UCLA, said the success of Niccol&#39;s plan will hinge on how well it&#39;s executed. &#34;It has to be more than just a marketing gimmick, and something that gets executed at a deeper level,&#34; he said. Starbucks&#39; attempts to emulate the feel of a neighborhood coffeehouse will work &#34;only if it can actually foster more of a sense of belonging,&#34; Hershfield added. Mário Braz de Matos, the cofounder of the Singapore-based branding consultancy agency Flying Fish Lab, said Niccol&#39;s changes would require &#34;consistent execution across Starbucks&#39; vast network of stores in the US,&#34; so employee training will be critical. Starbucks faces broader challenges, like competition from local coffee chains and evolving consumer preferences, which may limit its ability to attract new customers, he said. In global markets like China, Starbucks faces &#34;stiff competition&#34; from competitors like Luckin Coffee , he said. &#34;Additionally, the brand&#39;s ubiquity in markets like the US means it has fewer untapped customer segments to target,&#34; he added. The remaking of the Starbucks brand will take time, Chatterjee said &mdash; and as the brand works to build up more of a café vibe, it can&#39;t afford to lose the speed and efficiency that some customers desire. &#34;Sometimes, you want to linger and soak in the atmosphere, and other times, you need to grab and go,&#34; he said. &#34;Starbucks needs to win both those occasions.&#34; Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "description": "Look, all somewhat positive climate news has to be placed in the context of the ongoing global climate crisis, but this week, researchers did report a new simulation suggesting that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is unlikely to shut down within this century. Engineers developed a new flat telescope lens that captures color while detecting light from distant stars, minimizing some of the tradeoffs inherent to traditional lenses. And as a person who lives in a hurricane-prone region of the U.S., I was personally alarmed by the mass firings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, but this is ultimately going to impact everyone.",

Not long after the three-division champion from Baltimore survived 12 hairy rounds with Lamont Roach Jr to narrowly retain his title, Davis blamed the would-be knockdown that should have swung the fight to his opponent on a cosmetic malfunction.

When off the leash for a burst of potentially qualifying pace it was impressive on the brief occasions McLaren opted to show their hand, Norris aborting one flying lap that would have set tongues wagging. That early show of pace has not gone unnoticed by the other teams, with Lewis Hamilton among others acknowledging that McLaren are set to be sharp from the off – the start Norris has long craved for a tilt at the title.

The world’s first $1m women’s footballer , who signed for Chelsea from San Diego Wave in January for a $1.1m (£874,000) fee and has had to wait patiently for her debut while recovering from a calf injury that caused her to miss the SheBelieves Cup in February , had to be withdrawn just before the hour.

With their Premier League status secure, they’ve no reason not to go all-out for the Cup, and given the teams left, they’ve a decent chance of making something happen. Bassey is exactly the kind of centre-back Hojlund can spend an entire match fruitless fighting; Robinson is a one-man left-flank; and Iwobi has excellent ball-carrying capabilities. Amorim has little in the way of options. He’ll be devo’d about Dorgu, banned for the first of three games – already, his new signing had made a difference, giving United width, balance and physicality, doing the right things and building a promising partnership with Bruno Fernandes. Mazraoui, though a lovely footballer, offers little attacking threat from wing-back, likewise Diogo Dalot on the other side, while there could scarcely be less pace behind the nominal centre-forward, Rasmus Hojlund, both Eriksen and Joshua Zirzkee looking like they run in a wind-tunnel.
